  "title": "Why is Quran Revealed in Arabic? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question my name is Ali hayar Pason I'm from Afghanistan and I'm living in Iran now sometimes the Iranians discuss with me and they ask a question to me why Allah the almighty revealed Quran in Arabic language the question posed by Ali had Pason is that he has been asked because he living in Iran by the Iranians that why has Allah subhana wa ta'ala revealed the Quran in Arabic number one the Quran was revealed about 1400 years ago in Arabia so if the Quran was revealed in Arabia in Makkah Madina it has to be revealed in Arabic it not be revealed in English or Japanese or Chinese or Hindi if the Quran was revealed in a land it has to be revealed in the land in which the language is spoken number two the Quran was revealed to the last and final messenger Prophet MH peace be upon Him whose mother tongue whose language is Arabic so if the Quran was revealed to the last and final Messenger mhammad s wasallam and if mother tongue was Arabic it had to be revealed in Arabic it would be unique or it would be weird that the Quran is revealed to an Arab in Japanese he not understand so if he has to explain to anyone imagine he will go to a Japanese and explain to him something in Japanese which he doesn't know the language so number one the Quran was Arabic because it was revealed in Arabia number two it was revealed to an Arab Prophet Muhammad peace be upon therefore in Arabic number three if you analyze the language in which the scriptures of the major world religions were revealed whether it be the Torah or the injil it was revealed in Hebrew in Aramaic in Greek the scriptures of Hinduism and Sanskrit all these languages are dead languages so the languages in which the scriptures of the major world religions were revealed whether it be Greek Aramaic Sanskrit only a handful of people in the world today maybe a few hundred or few thousand know about it a handful a few thousand these are dead languages it's not spoken by the masses but the Glorious Quran which was revealed 400 years ago it was revealed in Arabic and today Arabic is a living languages it's a living language more than 200 50 million people speak Arabic it is a mother tongue and the LA the language of the Quran is a high level of Arabic we have different dialects of Arabic the Saudi has a different dialect the amirati the Kuwaiti different dialects but in spite of the dialect the main language it is f the pure Arabic and even today this pure Arabic is spoken and the different dialects may have a different pronunciation may have different some of the words may change but as a language the Arabic is a living language it is the sixth largest spoken language in the world today and imagine if someone has to do some changes in the other religious scriptures of Hinduism or of Judaism or of Christianity since only a handful of them know the language it's easy to change no one will come to know but the Quran is revealed in Arabic which is a living language so Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala purposely in his Divine wisdom he chose Arabic as the language of the Quran because he knew it it's going to be a living language till the last day of judgment that's Point number three point number four the Arabic is a rich language it is a rich language so much so that that one word has many meanings many times one word has multiple meanings for example the first two verses of the Quran to be revealed is an Arabic word which means read it means to recite it means to proclaim the first word to be revealed in the Quran was it means to read it means to recite it means to Proclaim and all through all three meanings are valid means Lord R means cherisher R means sustainer so this word R has a variety of meanings in one Arabic word if I have to explain English I would say it's Lord cherish sustainer as I said is Arabic word which means a leech like substance alak also means something which clings alak also means a out of blood and the beauty of the Quran is all three meanings are correct today science tells us that the initial stage of embryo looks like a leech we know today that the embryo clings to the uterine wall so the second meaning clinging is also correct and the third the K clot of blood the initial stages of embryo looks like a k clot of blood so in that one word alaka Allah is giving us three scientific facts that the embryo initially looks like a con lot of blood it clings to the uine wall it looks like a leech so imagine this is the beauty of the Arabic language one word has many meanings this is the fourth reason fifth reason that for one English word many times there are 20 30 40 50 words for example for H horse in English is one word in Arabic you have 70 different words for the Arabic word for the English word horse lion has various words so one English word you can say in 20 30 40 50 different words in Arabic this is the beauty of the language number six number six the glor the Arabic language is divine it is pure it is phenomenal so much so that point number seven if you read the Quran the more you read the Quran the more you enjoy Normal book you read once twice Thrice maximum after that it's boring same thing what to read the beauty of the Quran is the more you read the Quran the more you enjoy the more you understand that same verse of the Quran can satisfy an intell ual even a common man because that one word has various meanings so it satisfied an intellectual scientifically it satisfies the lay man in a different way that is the beauty of the Quran it is a universal book The Point to be noted Point number six that the Quran when a person reads a lame man reads he enjoys intellectual reads he enjoys Point number seven the same Quran quranic ver has very meanings the more you read it the more you enjoy it the more you learn and the more you get hooked on to the Quran Point number eight the Arabic script if you compare to the other languages like English the Arabic is more concise for example if I have to write Muhammad in Arabic it is me ha M Dal four letters if I have to write in English Muhammad m u h a m m a d eight letters the space taken is much less in Arabic the alphabets are much less we have the ink required is less the page required is less so if you do analysis the Arabic requires 1/3 to 50% 1/3 to 50% of the space the ink the page as compared to other normal languages like English Etc and the last point is that it is a un book the Quran in Arabic is not only meant only for the Arabs it's meant for the whole of humanity whether you're English man a French man or a Japanese the Quran can be translated though the language is very pure it's untranslatable book but whatever translation you have it can be given to those who don't understand Arabic it has a lot of information it has information of how to lead your life it has information of the dun information of the AK information of science is a universal book it's meant for the whole of humanity because the Arabic is so powerful so Sublime So Divine so rich because of this Arabic language the Quran is the most positive book in the world because of the Arabic language the Quran is a proclamation to humanity it is a fountain of mercy and wisdom it's a future world Constitution it's a fountain of mercy and wisdom it's a warning to the heedless it's a guide to the AR it's Assurance to those in doubt it's a soless to the suffering and hope to those in despair so the Arabic language is so pure because of this it uplifts the Quran and unlike any other Rel scripture hope that answer the question"
