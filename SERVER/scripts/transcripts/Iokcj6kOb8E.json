  "transcript": "Tazawur from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I hope you are doing good Alhamdulillah I hope everyone every Muslim is good and having a good Ramadan I had a question for my friend and he said while making tawbah does he have to say does he have to repent sorry sorry he said while making tawbah do I have to say I repent with remorse intending not to sin again after quitting the sin and all the conditions or do if I say the phrase Allahumma inni tubtu ilay min kulli zamdu with these conditions in mind what is correct? First of all repentance is not something that you do verbally so you don't have to say I repent from all sins or I repent from this particular sin it is something that is in your heart so once you intend to repent and you express your remorse and you quit that sin and you intend not to do it again that would be sufficient"
