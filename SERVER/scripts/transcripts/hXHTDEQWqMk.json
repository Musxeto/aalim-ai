  "title": "Advice to those who waste time on Social Media? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and this is the last question \nif we have any callers   abdi samia from pakistan he says can you give \nus an advice to those who um use social media   among the youth? Well, the advice is mentioned \nin the Quran in the sunnah, Ittaqullah... Fear Allah. This thing that you're using, don't   even for a second forget that Allah will question \nyou about every page you open about every glance   you take about everything you hear. Allah would \nhold you accountable for every single thing   on the day of judgment so imagine if you waste \nyour time five hours, some eight hours a day   watching Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, \nthe whole nine yards, TikTok then what happens?   You waste so much time and you gain so many sins \nand this is the easy part what's worse is that   you are darkening your heart it's becoming \ndark stiff and hard! That's why you're not   finding the taste and the sweetness of salat of \ndua of reading the Quran, that's why you're always   depressed, always fed up and bored that's why \nyou look for new things and nothing seems to be   helping except digging yourself and burying \nyourself under more and more browsing of such   social media platforms and this is a very negative \nsign because lots of the Muslims who are drowned   in such things soon would end up leaving the fold \nof Islam unfortunately so just a reminder Akhi,   use the social media platforms as long as there is \nno sin and don't put a limit to the time, but in   return whatever time you spend on it spend equal \ntime on reading the Quran or offering Tahajjud   prayers. You will find that whoa you got to be \nkidding How long do you open the Quran every day? don't know what to say no no talk to me \nnobody's listening ramadan quran only in ramadan   subhanallah 11 months and you don't open the quran \nbut you have the audacity to spend two hours a day   on social media and then you want Allah to respond \nto your dua and to give you provisions and a good   job and a good spouse and to give you good health \nhello there's something wrong up here you have to rethink your life because \nit's going down the drain   so this is yani inshallah quick\nadvice"
