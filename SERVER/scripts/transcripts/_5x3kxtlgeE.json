  "transcript": "Khalilullah from Nigeria Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Now I was reading the book men and women around the messengers of Allah and I was reading about Ali and I read something about when And he was telling no that Do not be white or no a soothsayer and then I'll be a policeman a tax collector a total collector So I want to confirm if this possession this profession are not recommended for Muslim and also I think he also said The pit of a drum or a player which is something around us I I answer only one question. So as per what you've mentioned in the beginning, I don't know about this Narration whether it is authentic or not Related to Ali may Allah be pleased with him. I know that Abu Dharr Al-Ghafari may Allah be pleased with him said something Similar to that and something is also mentioned about Abdullah Masood May Allah be pleased with all the companions of the Prophet. Alayhis salatu wassalam and They used to Warn people from being a ruler being a policeman being someone in charge not because this is not permissible on The contrary the Prophet said alayhis salatu wassalam. There are seven on The Day of Judgment who will be in the shade of Allah azza wajal when there is no shade other than his shade The first one is a just and fair ruler So the Prophet is telling us that being fair and just is something that would lead you to Jannah However, the vast majority of people who assume such positions of power and authority Would do injustice to people Would be unfair Would use brutal force against the civilians and We see this worldwide So it is best for your deen not to be a judge though you have the knowledge though you have the religious commitment Yet, you don't know when fitna would sneak into your heart and corrupt it and this is why many scholars Rejected the position of being a judge Some of them were even tormented and thrown into jail and tortured to accept and they would not Like Abu Hanifa like Imam Malik like so many of the great scholars of Islam because they know this is a huge responsibility and And You never know if you push me too far I just might you never know what may happen When they see the money the gold and the power when someone whose clothes comes into them and cries and says I need a favor just once in a lifetime and They would compromise their religion accordingly. So I hope this answers your question You"
