  "title": "ðŸ†• Allowed to be Legally Married in the System but Islamically Divorced? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Our first questioner is, or caller, is Umm Amina from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. So I have a question about, my husband and I, we decided that I wanted a Khula from him, but I'm also under a Kama. And is it allowed in Islam for her to Islamically divorce, like I have Khula, but it still retains a Kama? Because I want to stay here until I'm able to go back to my country, to be legally married in the system, but we are Islamically divorced. Is that allowed? This is allowed, but it's against the law, which makes it sinful. So you can apply for Khula, or he can divorce you at court, and he would give you headway for six months or a year to be on his Iqama, giving up front the money for that, so that you can try to look for a job or to better your life in a different way. The Khula or the divorce is applicable and valid, but you would be sinful for cheating the authorities, because if anything were to happen, if one of you were to die, the authorities know that you're still married. You can come and say, no, no, we divorced, it wasn't registered, so we will deal with you as if you're still married, and the inheritance laws and the likes would all follow, and that would cause a lot of problems, and Allah knows best."
