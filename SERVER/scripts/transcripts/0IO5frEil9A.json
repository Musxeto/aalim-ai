  "title": "Can a female student doctor wear scrubs in Islam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "namira from georgia she says as a doctor student they give us scrubs now the scrubs i know usually come in blue and green and they have short sleeves and they're an opening to the neck so as a woman you cannot wear this but if they allow you to wear long jackets that doesn't expose your arm so it has a sleeve that is not type of a stretch grabbing to your arm and showing exactly the form of your arm it's a normal long trench jacket or rain jacket or something like the white uh jackets that doctors wear so the sleeves are loose and it's long going to your knees or below that and you can button it so that it doesn't expose your body and it doesn't show your body from the back so i can't tell how you are shaped and looked and it covers your whole body entirely this is okay unfortunately most likely this is not the case especially when a nurse or a doctor is to go to surgery and they have to scrubs they scrub but they have to wash so they go to this common uh uh preparation room where they just turn on the faucet and they wash all of their arms in front of each other this is haram how can you expose your arm in front of other men if you are have a special place where you can do that in isolation in front of only women yes it's okay again you must not wear fitting clothes so if this scrub you're wearing shows exactly how your shoulders and your waist is and your buttocks etc due to your physique this is not permissible even if it's for studying purposes because women's well-being and hijab is a priority we cannot jeopardize this at all"
