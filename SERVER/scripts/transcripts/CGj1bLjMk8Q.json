  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Salam to Allah. By the way Sheikh, Thirdly, in accordance to the foul language used, Muhammad, this goes totally against the impression one would get that a student of knowledge who asks about the hadith or an ayah or the meaning of it and then uses such foul language or makes dua at a fellow Muslim by saying may Allah humiliate you or slander them by saying you are a Paki or a Yemeni or this is totally unacceptable for a Muslim to do and if a Muslim falls into such things he has to rectify it and he has to seek medical attention, psychiatric attention because Islam is all about ethics, about moral conduct, about behaving well with others. The Prophet said, merely to accomplish and complete what was there before me from good ethics. Meaning that Islam came to complete the whole package of dealing with people with good moral conduct and to the people. May Allah azza wa jalla guide us all to what he loves."
