  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Okay, the question is above my pay grade. The brother says, in this city, there are deviant groups that are being protected by the government. What do you think? It's none of my business. I want to go home. I have nothing to do with your groups, whether good or bad. I'm not from the mafia, so I don't know what to do. This is something we as Muslims have to give dawah. And our dawah is by speaking, by fair preaching, by Quran and by Sunnah. Not by violence, not by conflict and fighting, not by pointing fingers, you're this, you're that. This is a blame game that everybody can do. This is very easy. I can say that, oh look at you, you're this, your garment is below your ankle, you don't have a beard, you smoke, you do this, you do that. A blaming game. This is not how the Prophet used to give dawah. This is not how the companions, may Allah be pleased with them, used to give dawah. Preach the Quran. Teach the people the meaning of the Quran. Give them the proper aqeedah according to Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. Spread the Sunnah of the Prophet in every single detail, even if it was as little as drinking with your left. Haram. You have to drink with your right hand. So if we manage to spread this Sunnah in every single thing, everybody would come back to the right path of the Prophet, and Allah knows best."
