  "transcript": "Salma from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh How are you Sheikh? I am a student. I study through online for my home but every Sunday I have to go for my exams about 100 kilometer for my home. For this I miss my Zuhr, Asr and Maghrib Salah in every Sunday. Now it is become my regular routine over the past one year and the next few months. In my institute there have no options to attend those prayer. Being a girl I cannot able to pray those Salah road or bus and in my country there have no rituals to women attend Salah in Masjid. In this situation what can I do? Will Allah punish me for Qajar Dosh Namaz? Of course Allah will punish you without any doubt. Salat is prescribed at specific times. You cannot skip a Salat even if you are totally bedridden and covered with impurities and najasa and you are unable to perform wudu, unable to face the Qibla. You are not allowed to skip prayer. You have to pray whether you are on the bus, on the train, whether you're facing the Qibla or not. To the best of your ability you must pray and Alhamdulillah Allah made a concession for us to combine Zuhr and Asr or Maghrib and Isha at each one's specific time if we're travelers. However having said that as a female it is totally prohibited for you to travel from one city to the other without the companionship of a male mahram of yours and your study is not a necessity. It is not a prerequisite to enter Jannah to have a degree but it is a prerequisite to enter Jannah to obey Allah and Allah told you not to travel without a mahram and Allah told you to pray on time and Allah knows best."
