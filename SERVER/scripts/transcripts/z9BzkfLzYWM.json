  "title": "Can Muslims accept halal food on Non-Muslim festivals? (Christmas, Diwali, Etc) | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay okay uh i have a christian neighbor she insisted very hard to send food to my house on this christmas i not at all want to receive the food but the thing is she uh her son reverted to islam a few years ago since then she started to be interested in islam so i was thinking if directly rejecting her instead of avoiding the food indirectly okay you know i got i got your question this one i i understand it totally i will answer you this one from bangladesh says in a very frequently asked question her christian neighbor offers her food on christmas and this neighbor has a newly reverted son and she's inclined to islam so neshwan is afraid that if she rejects her gift or food that she will be offended to make a long story short it is totally permissible for a muslim to accept a gift from a non-muslim on their festivals so if the hindus give us food on the diwali and the food itself is halal there's no problem in accepting it what's prohibited is for me to give them food on their festivals or to participate in gatherings and celebrations with them this is totally prohibited for a muslim but if i'm in the comfort of my own home or i'm at work and somebody brings me some candies or brings me a piece of a cake of a birthday and you're not diabetic it's okay to eat it you're not in a gathering with them and the food is halal and this is what the companions used to do when are even pleased with him was brought with the gift that the fire worshipers do under neruz and it's called faludage it's it's a form of sweet and he tasted it said the whoa that's good have this every now and then brought to us he accepted the gift though he knew no he though he knew that it was a celebration of the five worshipers but he's not in the gatherings with them he's not congratulating them so there's nothing wrong at all in accepting her gift providing that the food is halal"
