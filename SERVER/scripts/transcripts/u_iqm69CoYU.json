  "title": "She fears shirk when trying to avoid talking to non-mahrams, thinking its not for the sake of Allah",
  "transcript": "Religious beliefs, that would be a problem. Maysha from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wassalamu Alaikum My question is someone used to talk with non-mahram before coming back to deen and repenting but before blocking all interactions they both decided to convince their family in future and make dua for marriage but they both requested each other not to look for non-mahrams anymore so that they can have a minimum chance to inform their family but while avoiding non-mahram she instantly changed her intention that she is doing it for the sake of Allah not because of someone else but sometimes while she checks or scrolls other non-mahrams or talks or avoids or talks with one of his female relatives she fears of shirk so are all of this shirk or not? No there is no shirk"
