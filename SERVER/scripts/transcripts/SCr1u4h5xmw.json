  "title": "Does Thinking that Leads to Ejaculation Break the Fast? Watching something that lead to it?",
  "transcript": "the dollar from Pakistan my question is we know that if a person masturbates while fasting is a fasting is fast probes because of ejaculation right so what if a person have any bad thought or rewards watches something Haram and then he ejaculates unintentionally ejaculates so would that break is fast or not this is an issue of dispute among Scholars whether a person who ejaculates during the daytime of Ramadan without any action just fantasizing so some Scholars say that because he did not act upon it these intrusive thoughts the prophet said that Allah has forgiven my ummah for my sake for whatever intrusive thoughts that cross their minds as long as they do not act upon it nor speak about it and in either way the man who's or the person who's fantasizing or thinking of something and then all of a sudden ejaculates if there is such a person he's in big trouble but um if there is such a a person then the scholars say that this does not impact his fasting because he did not do anything action wise so it's like a nocturnal emission as if he was asleep but if he's watching Haram and this is an action by itself so this breaks his fasting and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
