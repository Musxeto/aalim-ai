  "title": "If there was to be a Prophet, it would be Umar Hadith Why didn't the Prophet mention Abu Bakr",
  "transcript": "Ayman from the Netherlands Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu I heard a hadith that was in a termity which says that the Prophet ﷺ said if there was to be a prophet after me it would have been Umar. If Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him was the dearest of men to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ then why did he say if there were to be a prophet after me it would be Umar? Why would it not be Abu Bakr? And is this hadith sahih or daif? The hadith is sahih to my knowledge. Why didn't the Prophet ﷺ mention Abu Bakr? Because Abu Bakr is better than Umar all in all but not necessarily better than Ali in judging or better than Khalid Ibn Waleed in running an army or fighting or better than Muadh Ibn Jabal in knowing what's halal and what's haram and the likes. So in total yes Abu Bakr was the best of this ummah without any doubt but that does not mean he would qualify to be a messenger or a prophet after the Prophet ﷺ if there were to be a prophet. So this choice is only in Allah's hands and according to specific characteristics that only Allah knows about. So no one has the right to judge and why did he say this about Umar not about Abu Bakr and Allah knows best."
