  "title": "If a girl is on her period, is it ok to pretend to fast in front of them",
  "transcript": "A sister asks, and she says if a girl is on her \nperiod and she wakes up for Suhoor and eats up   with her father and brothers and pretends \nto fast in front of them, is this okay? First of all, what is prohibited \nfor a woman on her menses is to fast,   and to pray, and this is the consensus of all \nMuslims, anyone that comes and says otherwise   risks getting out of the fold of Islam, so \nthis means that the actual Ibaadah, the actual   fasting, is prohibited upon a woman on her \nmenses, but if she pretends by not lying, simply   she doesn't eat, she joins them for [ ], she joins \nthem for Suhoor, and she does not say I'm fasting,   when they don't eat during the daytime she is \nwith them, doesn't eat, is she sinful, not at all,   there is nothing wrong in that especially if she's \ndriven by bashfulness and shyness, a lot of girls   don't feel easy going around telling people I'm \nnot fasting because this or that, so is she to   be blamed? No there's no blame none whatsoever \nhowever the blame is if she is asking she says   yes I'm fasting, or she refrains from eating \neven when she's alone because she feels that   it's best I don't eat or drink, I have to do this, \nI have to do that, this is totally prohibited,   so if what prevents her from doing that is being \nshy and bashful and at the same time she is not   lying, she doesn't say I am fasting then there \nis no problem in that Insha Allahu Azzawajal."
