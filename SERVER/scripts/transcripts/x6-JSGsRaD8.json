  "title": "ðŸ†• Online background check for a marriage proposal using a NonMuslim service, Kufr? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ahmad says, a family did an online background check on a Muslim man in the UK because he wants to marry their daughter. It was to check if he had any criminal background. It was done by a non-Muslim service by looking at the person's emails, online records, if they had any criminal record, convictions or any known violent past. Was this kufr as assisted by non-Muslim on a Muslim? So basically there are two issues. Issue number one, is this permissible to get the services of such an agency that would look in the background of an individual to check whether he is mentally sane, whether he has a criminal background or not. There is no problem in that. This is totally permissible, providing there is no spying. Because it was mentioned that they search his emails and this is totally prohibited. Searching a person's emails without his consent is spying and this is totally prohibited regardless of the reason. So just checking his background, his social media platforms, checking his criminal records, if any, checking with the police, there's no problem in that and this is totally permissible. The second issue is whether this is permissible because they have obtained the services of a non-Muslim over a Muslim. And there's nothing wrong in that. Didn't the Prophet ï·º get the services of Abdullah ibn Uraiqat, who was a kafir, to lead him and Abu Bakr from Mecca while migrating to Medina? He was a knowledgeable person of the routes and the ways leading to Medina. Didn't the Prophet ï·º obtain the services of one of the companions before he embraced Islam? If I'm not mistaken, maybe Safwan ibn Umayyah, when he borrowed from him the shields and the armour to fight? So there is a difference between taking their services in ways we may need and helping the disbelievers against the Muslims because they're Muslims. Now this is taking allegiance. If there's a non-Muslim country that we help and assist to fight a Muslim group or a Muslim country, just because they're Muslims, this is sheer hypocrisy from my side and this invalidates my Islam. Unlike if I'm helping the disbelievers against a Muslim group or a country for money, for wealth, for power, not because of the Islam and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
