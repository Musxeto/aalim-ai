  "transcript": "and hamza from bosnia sheikh what's the ruling on fixing the clothes during the prayer all the time like for example pulling up the pants before going to sujud or fixing the shirt after raising up to the sending position josecal sir from bosnia says what's the ruling on fixing one's clothes what do we mean by that see in prayer sometimes when we want to go for sujud if you're wearing trousers or pants sometimes you have to lift it a little bit so that it does it doesn't become so tight on your thigh so you just lift it a little bit and when you stand up you may fix your blouse or your t-shirt or your your uh shirt sometimes we fix our head gear when we stand up or before going to raku and do this so this movement is not plenty or a lot yet it is movement so would it impact the prayer the answer is no as long as there is a need for it there's no problem in that what about the the schools of thought that say three movements in the salat breaks it the answer is this is baseless so this has no foundation neither in the quran or in the sunnah and the doing of the prophet certainly confirms that this is baseless because we know that he used to pray as in one authentic hadith carrying his granddaughter umama bint abilas the daughter of his daughter zainab may allah be pleased with her and whenever he went for a sujud he would place her on the ground and whenever he stood up he would pick her up and pray while carrying her and this is movement more than three times so this is baseless and there's nothing wrong in that insha allah this goes against those who are preoccupied in unnecessary movement so there are people who have a mental disorder sometimes they're not aware of it so throughout the prayer the whole four raka's all what they do is this and i've seen many people do this and do this do this do this some of them just keep on scratching as if they have skin disease and this stops only when he offers the second salam to the left it's gone but it comes when he's in prayer so such possession such illness if it's uncontrollable this person is exempted but if it is within his powers to stop and doesn't stop it it may impact and nullify his prayer"
