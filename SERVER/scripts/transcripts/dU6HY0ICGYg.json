  "transcript": "We have Sino from Austria. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. So my question is in regards to purity as it causes me a lot of worries. So basically what I want to know is if my family members unfortunately consume najasa and like a few seconds after it they shake me the hand or they touch other things. What is the ruling on that? Because it's causing a lot of hardship because I think it's not just because they touched it and they ate najasa. Okay, first of all the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam lived in Mecca for 13 years surrounded by idol worshippers who consumed nothing but haram meat and najasa. Yet he used to sit with them, intermingle with them, shake hands with them and not wash his clothes wherever he sat or wash his hands whenever he touched a doorknob or shook hands with a non-Muslim. Which means that Islam is based on ease and simplicity. And this is always the question I ask those who come to me for counselling sessions. Is Islam a religion of ease and simplicity or is it a religion of hardship and difficulty? They all without thinking say it's a religion of ease and simplicity. Then I go and ask them what you're practicing in your life today. Is it ease and simplicity or hardship and difficulty? They all agree it is hardship and difficulty. Which means that you're not practicing Islam. Simple as that. So do not pay any attention to what they eat or what they touch. If you don't see with your two eyes, with your own eyes, traces of najasa that you are 100% certain of. I don't think anyone in his right mind of your relatives would eat pork chops and with all the grease in his hand would touch utensils and the refrigerator and you can see traces of such fat or such grease on these things. Nobody does this. So let go of your whispers of shaitan because he's trying to introduce hardship and difficulty in your life. www.mooji.org"
