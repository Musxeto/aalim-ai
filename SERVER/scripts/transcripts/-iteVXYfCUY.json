  "transcript": "uh ahmed from the uk my question is if somebody they were very ignorant of the woodland um and um say for example they just live like that and then they uh eventually find out uh the ruling um but they when they do also the only intent to uplift the most recent major impurity um so does this one russell account for all the um all the times the origin if that makes sense no it doesn't at all makes sense because you don't have scars and tattoos over your arm this i did not make also for this i did not make also four and which means that oops i have like 215 russell to be made up so might as well soak myself in the ocean for a couple of months hope that uplifts all the no the sec the major ritual impurity is one if you have it you have it all the way even if you did fifty a hundred a hundred and fifty times reasons to obligate you to do russell it's still one russell that suffices for all therefore if a woman was in her menses and she was in sexual impurity and she wanted to do a haram for tawaf and she wanted to do many things one also would suffice for all of that and allah azza knows best"
