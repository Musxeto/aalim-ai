  "title": "Using regular bank instead of Islamic Banks for Car Financing? Late fee given to charity still Riba?",
  "transcript": "from the U.S and this is our final question my question for today is a brother asked me a question and I wasn't able to answer it so I'm gonna ask you inshallah so the brother wants to finance a car but he went to the Islamic Bank and usually with Islamic Bank is it's kind of almost the same thing as interest they would charge like a fee a separate fee and add it to the cost but they say they only do that for houses and he wants to do it for a car so uh the regular Bank what he would do is let's say they charge four percent interest on a thirty thousand dollar car and if you don't do any late uh any late payments you need to pay all your payments on time it would only be that four percent and he says this would be the same thing as the fee would this be permissible because there is no other choice to do it other than that way I don't think that you have succeeded in conveying the actual transaction to me Islamic Banks do not lend money this is Haram whether it's one percent or half a percent they cannot lend you money dollars thirty thousand dollars in return for the amount in additional four percent or three or two or one percent this is total riba whether they're Islamic or Hindu or Christian or whatever this is riba totally Haram money in exchange of money with a benefit or interest is riba Islamic Banks actually sell you a commodity so you go and say listen this car thirty thousand dollars I'd like to buy it they say good luck we don't sell cars okay lend me the money we don't lend money but we have a hundred thousand Pence of this this maker in our stocks it usually costs like um uh thirty thousand dollars if you sell it on the market we'll sell it to you for 35 000 on installments so you buy it take it sell it elsewhere with whatever you get maybe you can sell it for 32 000 maybe you'll sell it for twenty eight thousand you and your luck so you buy things a commodity from them whether it's steel whether it's stocks whether it's a pen whether it's air conditioners and you take the merchandise you bought and you sell it elsewhere where you cash the money from a third party that is not connected to the bank and then you buy your car in cash from the dealer so if this is the case then this is halal late payment fee is Haram is riba and this is the most authentic opinion even if they say if you're uh late in payment we will charge you 500 we will not take it for ourselves we'll give it to a charity organization or to the poor or to an orphanage this is still riba and not permissible and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign"
