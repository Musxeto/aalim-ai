  "transcript": "Julie from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, if we say Subhanallah 10 times and then dua make, if we say Subhanallah 10 times and then make dua, the dua get accepted. Not true, this is not true. Who told you this? During tahajud or adhan iqama, should we say Subhanallah 10 times? No, no, no, no, there's nothing as such. I don't know where you got this Julie. Saying Subhanallah 10 times has nothing to do with your dua becoming accepted, whether it's between adhan and iqama or in the last third of the night or in sujood. No, it's not related to your dua acceptance, and any hadith in such a manner or relating to such a topic is not authentic."
