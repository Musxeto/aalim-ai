  "title": "Is the Hadith about music weak? I heard it was narrated by Hisham Ibn Amar - Assim Al Hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "and it is about the hadith about music is that hadith week because the narrator and the hadith is and imam ahmed said he was like he was reckless first of all the hadith that mentions the prohibition of musical instruments is narrated by imam al-bukhari muhammad which to the vast majority of muslims is the most authentic book or collection of a hadith after the quran and the hadith mentioned there was the prophet saying alaihis that there will be a group of my ummah that will come at the end of time who will make haram things lawful and he mentioned fornication intoxication consuming intoxicants uh wearing of silk and musical instruments and this hadith was also reported in sunan abi dawud with a connected chain of narrators with all great narrators so hearing statements randomly such as what you've quoted about imam ahmed did you hear that from ahad yourself no you've heard it from someone did you read it in the source itself no i read it in a book that was commenting on the prohibition of music and that music is not haram so as muhammad bin sarin said this knowledge is religion so look who you take your religion from it is not sufficient for someone to come and hear a narrator name and say that imam muhammad says order says without going to the references without going to but to go into the books of imam zahabi al-imam uh even etc and dig deep and see what scholars had said just taking a random quote from an imam which i don't know whether it is authentic to the imam or it was fabricated throughout the chain of narrators we have to look into that and neglecting the other great scholars and the ulama of who may have said many good things about him this is not logical and allah knows best"
