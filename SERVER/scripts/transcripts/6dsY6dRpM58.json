  "title": "OCD with opening the tip of private part or squeezing it to check for urine? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "So in the beginning when you got the feeling \nthat something was leaking ignore it,   to go to the toilet and open the tip \nof your private part and look inside,   this is unheard of, And definitely it's an \ninnovation it's something that is sinful upon you,   the urine in the private part is like the \nmilk in the breast of a suckling woman,   if you leave it is stays in, \nif you squeeze it is comes out,   this is why we say when you urinate you overwhelm \nyour private part with water and sprinkle some of   the water on the inside of your underwear so \nwhenever you get these intrusive feelings tell   yourself that this is the water from\n[ ] and never ever do this again unless you want to get yourself suffering \nfrom infection, nobody opens the tip of   the private part like what you're doing and \nmay Allah make things easy for all of us."
