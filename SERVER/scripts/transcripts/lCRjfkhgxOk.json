  "transcript": "fatima says i want to wear the proper hijab that is but my parents don't allow me they say it's too extreme and makes me look old and just covering the hair is sufficient what should i do first of all it differs from one situation to the other from one type of parents to the other from one country to the other in any way you need to be diplomatic you have to be respectful and beautiful with your parents and you have to make it a priority in your life that there is no obedience to any creature while disobeying the creator of god almighty so whatever your parents say if it goes against sharia you have to discard it and disregard it and not listen to them this doesn't mean we have to take them head-on and fight with them and argue with them be respectful be diplomatic dodge their comments most of the time at the end of the day you have to wear the proper hijab and not necessarily wearing the abaya the black abaya is a proper hijab this is one form of it if you wear any other outer garment that conceals your body curves and your bone structure and covers you in an islamic way this does the job but definitely not what they're saying if they're saying that just covering your hair and wearing a blouse or a shirt or a t-shirt and trousers or a skirt is is okay this is definitely not okay you must not obey them in that and allah knows best you"
