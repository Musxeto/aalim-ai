  "transcript": "consider subscribing and we're from india sec i have a question regarding reciting surah baqarah so to avoid entering python into the house can i recite the whole surah some part of it in the first day then some in the second day and some and third day and thus complete this one the most authentic the most authentic opinion can veer by is that you have to recite surat al-baqarah during the day so you can recite half of it in the morning and the other half in the afternoon or before maghrib without any problem you can divide it but not on different days the good news is that the prophet told us allah that reciting two ayahs the last two ayahs of surat al-baqarah from rasulullah um until the end two eyes only will prevent the devils from entering your house for three days and nights and this two eyes each and every muslim memorizes them by heart because we recite them as part of the bedtime athkar so each and every muslim recite these two eyes along of course with ayatul kursi before we go to bed every single night and the prophet said whoever recites them whoever recites them at night they will suffice him what is meant some scholars say they will suffice him as form of protection from the devils the second interpretation is it will suffice him from offering night prayer either way you should not leave reciting these two verses every single night and allah knows best you"
