  "transcript": "Allah says in surah bakar chapter 2 verse number 143 that we have made you an um a midl community so that you may be a witness over the nations and the messenger will be a witness over you it's our duty to convey the message of Allah subhana wa t'ala and our life the Islamic life is a balanced life unlike other beliefs it either talks about the body of fulfillment of the soul. Islam the solution is for the body and for the soul. A beloved prophet said it's mentioned in Sai Bkari volume number three had number 1975 the beloved prophet said Abdullah one of the Sabbath may Allah be with him I have heard that you fast all days and pray full nights he said yeah Allah the prophet said do not do it fast one day do not fast the next day pray part of the night sleep for part of the night your body has a right over you. Your wife has a right over you. So Islam is a justly balanced religion. It doesn't believe in monasticism. Doesn't believe in renouncing the world. The dunya in Islam is part of the dean. It is a holistic solution. And furthermore, when we see when people talk about happiness, talking about billionaires, we know the example of Christina on who inherited wealth after her father died who was a billionaire and during interview she was asked that you are the richest woman in the world. She said yes I'm the richest woman in the world but also the most unhappiest woman in the world. She didn't get peace. She didn't get happiness. And later on she committed suicide. And this is common family problems and all more in the rich than the poor. It's there in both. But rich wealth does not get you happiness. Allah says the wealth is a fit the test for you. And Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 13 verse number 28, verily in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find contentment. Verily in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find contentment. And that reminds me of a very good example of one of the greatest scholars of the medieval age. And we knew he lived a life of poverty. He was imprisoned. He was threatened by his enemy. He was tortured. So when the enemy threatened him, what did she said? He said that what can you do to me? What can you do to me? If you imprison me, if you put me in jail, I would do zikar of Allah. Zikar praise. and remember Allah. If you exile me, I would I would contemplate on the creation of Allah. If you execute me, I would be a shahid. I would be a martyr. My ja is in my heart. Imagine a person who's not afraid of dying. Whatever you want to do, you do. You cannot take away the ja. My ja is in my heart and I'm not of this dy I'm for a so this is true happiness even though he lived in poverty even though he was taught and if you read the statement of may Allah have mercy on him he was one of the well-known students of Islam he says the life that alsia lived of poverty he was imprisoned but I've never seen in my life Any man who's more happier than imagine life of poverty being tortured to give up his mission he didn't budge if you imprison me I will desikar of Allah if you exile me I will contemplate on the creation of Allah if you execute me I'll be shahid my ja is in my heart so he cannot take away his ja so this is True happiness. True happiness. And that reminds me that once a Jew goes to Hajarcalani who was a judge, he was rich and a Jew, a poor man comes and tells him that your prophet said that this dunya is like a jail imprisonment for the believers and for unbelievers it's paradise. I am poor. My clothes are tattered. You're rich. You're living a luxurious life. How can you explain this hadith said those believers who know what is waiting for them in a ja even if you're the richest man in this world all the happiness compared to Jenna is like compared to Jenna is like imprisonment. And if the unbelievers knew what is there for them in the hakra hell and the lowest the coolest fire in hell if it touches your feet your brains will boil. If they know where they will go even if they are the worst human being in this world for them this is ja. This is explanation of hadith of beloved prophet wasallam. So Jenna happiness is a state your belief your"
