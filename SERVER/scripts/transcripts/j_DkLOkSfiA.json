  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh My question is my father died so now for our \nliving we have to sell a land which my dad   possessed but my mom is saying that dad told \nher that he took it from his aunt in a wrong   way without the aunt knowing about it but my mom \ndoesn't have any strong evidence to prove it nor   do I know anything about it and I can't go deep \ndown into the details and investigate the issue,   I read out the land papers and it clearly states \nthat dad bought the land and everything is okay   so is it permissible to sell the land and \nconsume the money for us? As long as there   is no one challenging you and your aunt or \nher children are not challenging with proof,   the default is that the land is yours \nand you can sell it and benefit from it,   your mom's claim is not backed \nup by any evidence and we cannot   apply such a claim without evidences so In Sha \nAllah there is no problem in you selling it."
