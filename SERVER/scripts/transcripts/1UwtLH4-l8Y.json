  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Canada Sheikh when someone wants \nto make repentance uh assuming that they want to   make a sincere repentance they're lacking \nremorse they're like hard for them to feel   remorse so what can they do that okay this is \nproblematic because if someone wants to repent   sincerely if the element of remorse does \nnot exist his repentance is not valid   the Prophet (Peace and Blessing Upon Him) said \nin an authentic hadith repentance is remorse   or remorse is repentance which means that it's \nthe major pillar of repentance without remorse   your repentance is invalid \nyou can quit a sin you can   try your level best to pledge not to do it again \nyou can ask Allah for forgiveness and do good   deeds but deep down if your heart is not burning \nbecause of what you had done in the past you don't   have this remorse nothing is going to stop you \nfrom doing it doing it again and therefore you   have to even fake it and convince yourself that \nyou're remorseful or your repentance is not valid [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
