They have beliefs in some cases that may take them out of the fold of Islam. And some of them, they may attribute themselves to be Naqshbandis, but they don't believe in their hardcore disbeliefs. But in general, yes, they are deviant sect that has lots and lots of innovation that do not relate to proper Islam from the Quran and Sunnah. And Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best.
