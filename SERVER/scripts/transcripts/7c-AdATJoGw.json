  "title": "She held the Quran in her hand & LIED on it to protect her HONOR, what is the ruling? |AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "that she held the quran in her hands and lied on it like uh she took a false oath to protect her honor but ever since she has felt remorseful and she does not what to do she does not know what to do okay what was the thing that she swore against she didn't tell me she said it was to protect her honor okay any more questions no thank you jazakallah from pakistan says her friend asked her this question and she made a false oath while holding the quran and she says what should she do well first of all there is no great emphasis when you make a normal oath by allah's name or when you hold the mushaf some of the scholars even went further and said that making an oath on the mushaf is an innovation it's a bidder some scholars said that this is to give an emphasis like when you give an oath after asar or when you give an oath next to the member of the prophet sallam or next to makkah ibrahim in mecca but this is beside the point this was not done by the prophet sam or his companions so the act itself is not from the sunnah and it is closer to be a clear innovation yet this does not impact the oath so whether you say verbally wallahi i didn't do this and you were lying or you put your hand on the mushaf and say well i didn't do this and you're still lying it's the same thing secondly there is no expiation for oaths that are done for things that were in the past the expiation is only for the things in the future whether that you would do it or not do it so if i say wallahi i will not enter your home indefinitely or i won't have lunch with you tomorrow and then i break my oath i have to expect if i say wallahi i will bring you the money tomorrow and i don't i have to expiate but something in the past i didn't take the pen whether i was lying or telling the truth regardless there is no expiation even if i was lying there is no expiration because it was something in the past whether i'm sinful or not this depends on a number of factors now if someone was put under the spotlight and he was forced to swear and take an oath over something that would jeopardize his safety so someone is hiding in my room and an assailant a perpetrator is asking is there anybody in the room if i say yes he's going to kill him if i say no he says swear i said okay he said no sway on the mushaf he brings the quran bring me six copies he's not in the room there's no problem in that because this is something that i was forced to do and likewise if it did it dealt with my honor if it dealt with a woman under pressure from her husband who is insisting as an ignorant imbecile that she swears and takes an oath on the quran that she didn't have any relationship before marriage some of your business what i did before marriage he said no you have to swear by allah or i'll divorce you if she says the truth she's going to be divorced and her reputation would be tarnished forever no take an oath and this is forced oath under com compulsion you're forced to do this and insha'allah this is not sinful or not knows best"
