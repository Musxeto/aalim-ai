  "title": "OCD with checking Underwear for discharges? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "faizan from india says when can we check our underwear when i have these feelings of maddie being emitted aki if a person is a normal person who does not have these with swas and continuous whispering of shaytan and many people like this have these whispers they go check they find nothing and after 10 minutes they go check they find nothing and this becomes an obsession and after a couple of weeks they start doing something that is not natural nor medically safe such as squeezing their private part or opening it to look for something or etc and this would lead to infection and a serious illness so such people we say do not check because this is continuous and it's ocd only when you go to urinate or defecate answer the call of nature then by default you're gonna drop your pants so you're gonna see that and check no problem with that but do not do it otherwise someone who's totally normal never get to these thoughts and he sees something that arouses him and he feels that something was discharged this is a different issue altogether"
