  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. Is it halal for a Muslim to work for IRF as a revenue officer? The IRF is dealing with taxes, and collecting taxes is not permissible in Islam, according to the most authentic opinion, because the many hadiths where the Prophet indicated, Alayhis Salaam, the gravity of the sin of the Ash'ar, who takes 10% of whomever comes for the authority, for the government. And taxations are not permissible to be forcefully taken. This is my hard-earned money. Who gives you the right to take a percentage of it, whether it's customs, or taxes, or revenue, or whatever? All of this is not permissible. So, even if there are scholars who allow this, yet it is not permissible for you as a Muslim to work in such a department, and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me, and let's speak about it, inshaAllah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
