  "transcript": "foreign [Music] so this is an issue where there is some form of ambiguity in the case in the sense that when I do good deeds I usually do them for the sake of Allah unless it is specified that this particular deed would have consequences as mentioned in the Quran or the Sunnah I shouldn't be doing it for removing a calamity example the prophet tells us Allah that connecting your kinship visiting your relatives your uncles and cousins and the likes and your siblings would prolong your lifespan and increase your provision and your wealth from Allah so this is a Clear Connection so I do call my siblings and I do visit my cousins and uncles and aunts because it's a form of worship instructed by Allah and because I know that I'm gonna get money out of that by Allah sending me provisions and my life would be prolonged and barakah would be placed in it there's no problem in that but if I have a problem in my car and I decide to pray night prayer or offer to rakas of hajja so that Allah would fix my car that would be problematic because this is not part of the Sunnah so the scholars say it there has to be a relationship between the Good Deeds proven from the Quran and the Sunnah such as connecting your kinship giving in charity a person gives in charity to uplift a Calamity or to cure an ill person this is something that the scholars say it is legitimate due to some Hadith weak or Hassan it's debatable but it extinguishes the anger of Allah but to fast the day in order to pass the test next week or the likes this is not part of the Sunnah and Allah Knows Best"
