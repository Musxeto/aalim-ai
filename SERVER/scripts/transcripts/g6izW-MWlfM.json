  "transcript": "Tameem from Iraq. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, I'm from Northern Iraq and many people in my community, they are very pro-Saddamist and pro-Ba'athist and some of them even go to the extent of saying things like Saddamu Alaikum Wa Li'ad Billah. How is this permissible to say or is it permissible to identify in this kind of way or not? Yeah, you've just said it. Wa'alaiyazu Billah. Things that are not natural, things that are stupid by nature, are well identified by normal people. Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity. We say Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam. Any alteration or trying to manipulate things, this is not from Islam, definitely."
