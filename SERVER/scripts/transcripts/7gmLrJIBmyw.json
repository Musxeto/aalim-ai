  "transcript": "mistrust or be suspicious imagine that the prophet said when a traveler comes back home he should notify his wife and not suspect them in any means so my my flight is next week i don't tell my wife i come a day earlier why just to see maybe i don't know who she's having home this is haram why because this is suspicion that allah does not love also i got gazillion questions from sisters saying sheikh i suspected my husband i opened his mobile i took his fingerprint i took his fake without him knowing and i did this and i went to his whatsapp messages and i went into his hidden files and i went to his icloud cia doesn't do this and she does this why she said i suspected him and then whenever there is disrespect and lack of trust between a man and his wife marriage cannot go on ever so you have to have this between you both and uh finally both spouses must have great amount of tolerance and patience why is it that men are always quick to be angry and impulsive i did this to my husband and he started shouting and screaming and breaking things in the house threatening me of divorce what did you do my daughter i just added a little bit more salt than usual in the food some men are crazy seriously and i say he says halas i've had it i can't stand my wife why and the same thing happens with women she says i want color i want to leave why she said he did this and this and this i said okay let's look at the good points first does he have any good points of course he's generous he's handsome he's kind he takes the children to fun fairs he takes me twice a year to uh genting and he does this she does that okay what you do not like ah sometimes he doesn't speak to me so i want hulu subhan allah where is the patience there is no patience among the spouses and this is what causes a lot of hatred and with the years it causes separation you're married right i'm married imagine the prophet is sitting with his companions like this huh and the maid comes with food from safiya's house today is aisha's day so we're sitting in aisha's house or in the masjid and the maid comes from safiya with food in a plate is there anything wrong no aisha feels jealous she stands up in front of the men hits the hand of the maid breaks the plate and the food is scattered on the floor and i'm the man sitting with my companions what would you do immediate divorce seriously she is insulting me in front of the men the prophet israel the greatest man ever stands up goes down on his knees collect the food and he says to the companions don't worry don't worry your mother is jealous he's explaining justifying and he collects the food and he takes one of aisha's own plates as a punishment and he says a plate for a plate that's it no swearing no cursing no threatening of divorce tolerance look the other way your wife might say something bad pretend you did not hear it in an ah seriously this is oh what do you mean i have to explain it to her i have to write it on the blackboard you said this on that lots of the sisters are like this now we're okay we're fine i did one single mistake in 2017 march 24th you said so and so so-and-so i don't remember what i had for lunch yesterday but she gives me a list of the what is this if you hold one against me i'll hold 10 against you what kind of a marriage and compassion and love and mercy is this no look the other way pretend you did not hear a thing because people were times of anger they say thing and they don't mean it if you hold them accountable for it then others will hold you accountable for whatever you say so the best thing to do is what move on move on and you live and this is the topic by itself in arabic we call it in one of the beautiful etiquettes of islam that the prophet did even prophet yusuf in the quran when they went to egypt and he was the king and he accused their younger brother of stealing and he said no no we don't know anything of this said well we found the cub the measurement cup in his luggage what did they say this is well if he stole then his brother stole way before him accusing who accused they didn't know that he was yusuf allah says he kept it to himself he did not show it to them this is the raffle but if you hope everyone for whatever they say hey what did you mean oh you don't have you don't know i'm telling you i don't know what do you mean what do you know what education do you have how many years did you teach the quran he just said the word move on and a lot of the spouses say a lot of words move on because this is marriage you forgive me once i forgive you twice may allah be pleased with him the companion of the prophet saws said to his wife if you see me becoming angry ask for my forgiveness and pleasure and if i see you becoming angry i will ask you for forgiveness and here for your pleasure otherwise we cannot live together if she you flare up we have fire whenever she is you just said she says you you said i love you too she cools down but if she points at you and you point at her and she says you have this and you say you have this this is not healthy marriage finally not in the lecture in in the introduction the common things huh finally marriage is a mutual responsibility i as a husband when i come home i have nothing to do with the children with their school with teaching them with helping the shores with cooking nothing and this is wrong the prophet himself used to of course not to share everything in the house because already i have my responsibility outside the house i'm earning i'm having problem in work with the neighbors with the financing of my expenditure but at the same time this doesn't exempt me from giving a helping hand this will bring the children at least when she shouts and says father look at your son what he's doing he said yeah i know no you don't know you have to intervene you have to discipline the kid if you don't obey your mother i'm gonna do this and that would so she feels that you are her rock you are someone to depend on but if you come home uh where i'm watching tv bring me the other remote and not contributing you have a problem she also has to appreciate what you're doing you spend 10 hours outside the moment you turn the key and enter the house instead of finding a smiling face how are you she you would hear complaints your mother called and she's always saying bad things about me your sister did not invite me for the wedding of her son and our neighbors did this and that and you're saying your head is growing whenever i speak to you why don't you look at me you don't see me because yes you have your secretary in the office she is more beautiful where am i this is living hell no you have to know that it's a company it is a team work it's not you the only one who's running the marathon imagine if i'm running the marathon and my team members helping me stand in my face while i'm running said take a towel said get out of my way i want to run say no no you have to stop take a towel take some water and refresh and then think you must run with me and give me the towel and give me the water and give me the assistance not be a handler and a barrier in front of me i will lose so a marriage is give a little bit you take a little bit now we move on to the rights of the spouse how much time do you have nobody knows okay they say ladies first i will not complete they this first insha allah so we start with the rights of the wife there are so many rights but i tried to summarize it to yanni whatever is most essential and important the first right of a woman is the financial expenditure huh not treating her well no no no no all of this comes second the first thing is that you provide for her because before you married her she was living with her father who was giving her without any account who was providing her with the house with the respect with the love she needed now she moved into your charity the prophet was asked oh prophet of allah what are the rights of my wife over me that's a fair question look at the answer and implement it in your marriage to know whether you are a good husband or not the prophet says to feed her when you feed when you eat to dress her when you are clothed and you do not strike her face and you do not insult her meaning that your face is like a rangatang or a monkey or this you don't say this because her face is beautiful you're blind and the prophet says and do not abandon the house meaning that okay i'm not gonna stay in the house for three days four days i'm gonna sleep in my in my father's house i'm gonna go somewhere no the prophet said assalam don't you have to remain with your wife you must remain in the house allah says about expenditure allah says men are in charge of women by right of what allah has given one over the other and what they spend for maintenance from their wealth so allah made the men guardians responsible [Music] because allah favored men over women and because of what the men spent and this is why if the man can cannot provide for his wife she is not obliged to obey him she is not obliged to stay in his home she can leave and she can file for divorce without giving him the dowry the judge forces him to divorce her without any compensation because this is his her god-given right that you must provide for her if you can't she is not obliged to obey you not even in terms of intimacy the one says i'd like my rights as a husband from my wife you're not paying money you're not providing you have no rights so this is a very important and crucial right of women number two one of her rights is that you do not beat her and in islam the issue of beating women is nowadays a very controversial issue because once you open this topic if you are in western countries who do not adhere to islamic values they would immediately put you in jail ah abusing women domestic violence this this and if you are in some primitive countries who do not refer to islam as a way of life they say that i can beat my wife as much as i want this is my god-given right and this is not can one discipline his wife by for example not taking her to a summer vacation is this legitimate for example if my wife does not obey me and i said okay this uh december we're not going to uh ballet island i'm canceling my vacation with you is this wrong this is form of discipline reprimand so a man isn't is entitled to do this a father is entitled to reprimand his son who's disobedient an employee a employer is entitled to discipline his subordinate by sacking him by taking two days of his pay by uh the uh demoting him not promoting him these are disciplinary actions type when it comes to the wife okay what are my alternatives my wife is disobedient i say right she says left i say cook she says go to your mom's house i say my clothes are dirty need ironing said i'm not your laundry service but you have to pay me money you have to bring me food you have to hire me a car and a driver and a maid what are you doing for me said none of your business she is disobedient what to do in islam you have a choice choice one divorce easy assuming what will you do i'll divorce you and i'll marry someone who's younger and more beautiful and wealthier and she is an imam she's practicing women not that she has a good a long period so i will do this oh this is easier divorce is good no it's not good something that this you do not solve problems by running away you have to face them so what does quran say allah says in the quran but those wives from who you fear arrogance and disobedience first advise them then if they persist forsake them in bed and finally strike them so beating is there in the quran you cannot play with that this is iman or now a lot of the women this is fitna for them ah beating in the quran i don't like islam okay go to hell with all due respect this is not my word this is the words of whom the prophet isam but you have to understand everything in context so when allah says strike them it doesn't mean from day one woman put the food i'm tired i don't feel like cooking today you go and bring your baseball baseball bat okay bismillah strike one bang what are you doing allah says strike them there are two things before so women whom you feel or fear arrogance and disobedience one advise them bismillah no no no wait wait advise them scholars say that this might take three weeks four weeks of constant reminding them of allah of hell fire of paradise of the responsibilities of every fee and try to instill in them in install in them the fear of allah azza three weeks four weeks it's not working sheikh number two abandon them only in terms of intimacy so when she feels that oh my husband is not desiring me although for the past 10 years we used to have a very good relationship but now he's staying away from me every time i try to get closer to him he's get something wrong she feels bad about it supposedly she should some women said a couple of years more you want me to move to the second room i can but generally speaking you are trying to fix things not to make it worse after three weeks four weeks and she's still defiant then you are entitled by allah and by the messenger of allah azza to discipline her through beating her okay now it's the baseball bat no again what are you doing allah says beat them in the quran he said yes but who explains to us how to beat them the prophet is his companions says you will beat your wife with a miswak excuse me what what is this what after two months of depriving myself from my rights and you tell yes because it's not supposed to hurt physically it's supposed to hurt mentally so even abbas says and all the scholar says you do not leave a mark so this is not permissible because this will become bread i hope my wife forgives me who did this to you anyhow so leaving a mark is prohibited breaking a bone is prohibited shedding blood blood is prohibited and what kind of striking then not even my badminton racket would have would work let alone baseball what is this this is not to hurt physically but rather she would feel that allahu akbar my husband after 10 years or 15 years of marriage does this to me i must have done something wrong let me consult let me ask let me try to ask for his forgiveness this is one of her rights number three as mentioned before except in bed so intimacy is no longer there but you have no right in islam to leave the house a lot of the men when they're angry with their wives they go for one week two weeks what are you well i'm somewhere in the hotel no this is haram you solve your problems by staying home like a man but if you leave like a coward this is not gonna take you anywhere number five her rights is to deal with her with respect what do you mean by respect you do not curse you do not swear you do not say any bad words to her because a believer is not a person who slaunders or who curses or who uses profanity so many times we i get problems from wives that are being verbally abused by their husbands in front of the children and by animals a real man does not say this you want to fight with your wife put the kids to sleep go lock the door and fight but to show this to the children you're not a real man you are negatively causing them to become like you when they're older and this is totally wrong one of her rights is that when you take a second wife that you are fair with both or three or four of them otherwise don't be pretending to be a real man you must be fair and fairness if you are taking more than one wife means that you first financially provide for both of them together taking a second wife who's younger and spending more time with her more money because the first wife has kids and this one doesn't is unfair and you will come on the day of judgment with your face tilted you have to be fair in time one day here one day here one week here one week here you have to be fair in expenditure spending money so you buy this wife uh a gift of 300 ringgit this wife you have to buy her a similar gift maybe not a dress maybe perfume but the same money spent and no one knows about this except allah azza the first wife doesn't know that you're gonna buy the other one a gift as well but this is something allah would hold you accountable the prophet says whoever has two wives and leans towards or favors one of them over the other he will come on the day of judgment with half of his body leaning half of his body would be tilted and people would know that oh poor thing he had two wives look at him in front of everybody on the day of judgement this is a scandal but this is what allah is warning you number six your wife's rights upon you is that you conceal what is intimate and secret between you two i've seen some people who claim to be men and who would come and say well we did this and that with my wife we did it here we we went there and she did this and she said that intimate things that should not leave the bedroom it's haram and the prophet said allah the worst people on the day of judgement at the side of allah is a man having intimacy with his wife and she's having intimacy with her husband and then he comes out and he spreads these secrets and discloses these secrets this is unfair and tell me how many men are mama's boys she did this she said that i don't what is this he goes to his mom for his suckling and he goes and tells her every intimate thing and then she is stabbed in the back when she is talking to her mother-in-law and she said yeah my husband said you said this you did this you did that and her sister-in-law knows about it and her nephew and her everybody in the what kind of marriage is this he's not a man because he doesn't know how to zip it how to close his mouth about things that should be only between a man and his wife number seven helping the wife in the house and we spoke about this when we have to move a little bit eight um to allow her to go out now we know as we will come in the husband's rights that it is part of a man's right that his wife seeks permission before leaving a woman cannot leave the house is she a prisoner no she's not a prisoner but she cannot leave the house without the permission of her father if she is not married so she cannot say i'm going coming after two days and the father where have you been said i went out what will he do smack her how do you do go out do you think this is open house you have to ask me where you're going and seek my permission likewise when she gets married she cannot leave the house without the permission of her husband some husbands abuse this right and i've got so many complaints for me as a husband my wife has an open permission she used to call me in the first years of marriage i want to go to my father's house i want listen honey save money it's rhymes all i can be eminem listen honey save money and you go wherever you want to go as long as you know that i'm okay with it so she doesn't go to the movies because she knows i'm not good okay with it she goes to her uncle to her mother's house her father's house to go shopping she knows i'm okay with that she doesn't have to but some men no they have this inferiority complex say before you step out you must notify me but you're traveling overseas call me sms me i want to go to the hospital wait for my permission come on be a man this is not expressing your manhood this is expressing that you have something wrong up there that needs fixing yes it's your right but don't abuse it so a real man allows his wife to go to his parents to her parents house i have so many complaints of women their husbands prevented them from visiting their parents house for six seven years why he says this is my right no it's not your right it is you're right that she obeys you but you're sinful at the side of allah and allah will punish you in your grave insha'allah in hellfire why are you doing this don't you know that you have daughters and they will get married soon and their husbands will treat them in the same fashion"
