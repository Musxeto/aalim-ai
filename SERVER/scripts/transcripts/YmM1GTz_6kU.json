  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh okay so \nmy question is where to look while I'm   sitting in salat for example between \ntwo two sujud and others and should I   raise my index finger in second rakat of \nfour rakats prayer while sitting this is so the question is straightforward while sitting \nbetween the two prostrations where should I look   in tashahud that is in the second sitting \nor in the final tashahud and that is the   third sitting in Maghrib or \nthe fourth sitting in Asar uh   we are instructed to point our index finger \nand look at it but between the two prostrations   I'm not requested or instructed to raise \nmy index finger because there is not a   shout out so my hands are still on my \nknee and thigh the right knee and thigh   so where should I look the answer is to the \nspot where I prostrate where I put my forehead   so this is where I should keep my eyes on \nthroughout the prayer except when I sit for   the tashahood and I move my index finger \nI should look at it and Allah Knows Best"
