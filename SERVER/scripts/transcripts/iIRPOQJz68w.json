  "transcript": "a person who's anonymous says when we do not have wood is it not permissible to touch the Koran whether it's writing the spaces between the lines its margins binding the carrying strap attached to it or the bag or box it is in can we pick it up and read it using a cloth on our hand as a barrier this is an issue of dispute among scholars now the origin of this dispute is a verse in the Quran which all scholars say that it does not refer to the Quran yet you find it in so many copies lie a masseur who in LaMotta Harun that it is not to be touched except by those who were purified and this is in Sura tilapia and this ayah is referring to the preserved tablet and the motor Harun the purified are the angels so it has no reference to the Quran but there is a hadith where the Prophet Allah saw some wrote a letter to the people of Yemen and he stated in it that I am a super Anna in lapa her that the Quran must not be touched except by someone who's pure now the vast majority of scholars said that you have to be in the state of boodle and this is why we always advise people to be in this state of wouldl if you want to touch the Quran however some scholars argued this and said that to be pure as mentioned in the hadith has three levels so a mushrik is impure allah azza wajal says in the quran enamel mushrikuna najasun' are impure and this is not referring to the physical impurity but rather to the internal purity because they're associating others there worshipping others than allah so to us Muslims they are impure internally their souls are not pure others say a person who has a major ritual impurity whether through ejaculation intercourse or menses or postnatal bleeding this person is considered to be impure so he as well is not or she are not allowed to touch the Quran according to the hadith and finally a person who has nullified his rule by answering a call of nature by sleeping by eating camels meat so which one do we say that the Prophet meant are in salat wa sallam it's an issue of dispute and it's a long topic where each party has their own evidences hence it is safer for you to be on the safe side not to touch the Quran if you touch it wearing gloves then insha'Allah there's nothing wrong in that better more nowadays we have our PDAs we have our mobile phones we have our tablets or computers the books of tafseer all of these do not require that you be in the state of wood"
