  "transcript": "[Music] says i need an advice how could i make myself more close to allah and have more barakah in my life barakah comes from allah azzawajal and in order for you to get closer to allah in the hadith allah says and my servant would not do anything to get closer to me better than what i have mandated upon him so this is clearly mentioning the issue of allah loves most that you do what he has mandated upon you what does that mean if you pray five hours of night prayer that's nice allah loves this but you as a consequence miss fajr prayer and you oversleep allah does not accept this deeds of yours because the fajr prayer of five to ten minutes is more beloved to allah azza than six hours of night prayer so if you want to get closer to allah azza put your priority list in order number one do every single thing that you're ordered to do and this does not only relate to prayers or to fasting ramadan or to giving zakat or to performing hajj and umrah these are pillars of islam not limiting islam to it only there is an obligation to be obedient to your parents respectful and dutiful a lot of the muslims fail to do this and focus on only praying in the masjid having a long beard etc which is good but this is also a fart connecting your kinship and the majority of muslims sivir their kinship for one reason or the other and you would never fail to get astonishing reasons and justifications for that oh they didn't call me to their daughter's wedding six years ago so i would not contact them oh they said something disrespectful oh their brother hit my sister in the subhanallah the end conclusion severing the kinship which is a major sin when you do the things that allah has obliged you and you refrain totally completely from what allah has made prohibited upon you you will get closer to allah our problem is that we can't have the full package so yes i pray in the masjid i fast ramadan i give charity i offer night prayer but when it comes to refraining from listening to music i'm too weak when it comes to not watching movies difficult when it comes to not backbiting others what will we talk about when we meet so we tend to put a number of obstacles ending up in the fact that we are not getting closer to allah if you look at the purity of the heart which is an essence and the purity of the heart has nothing to do with your actions i can take different actions to reprimand people in order to help them be better muslims while my heart is pure towards them and filled with love towards them there's nothing wrong in that there's no conflict in that so when i take a position this doesn't mean that i have ill intent towards you no not at all so once you manage to do your obligations towards allah and you leave no box unchecked once you manage to stay away from major and minor sense because allah has prohibited that you've accomplished 80 percent of your mission in getting close to allah azzawajal if you add the extra 20 which is voluntary deeds which is refraining from macro deeds not haram haram we already done that but also to avoid what is this light then you've attained the remaining 20 allah says in the hadith was mentioned earlier so the most beloved thing to allah azzawajal is the mandatory acts and then my servant allah says continues to get closer to me with voluntary deeds until i love him okay so after fulfilling the mandatory act the 20 remaining is voluntary acts that you offer and offer an offer until allah loves you and this is the ultimate target and objective of any human being specifically of any muslim to attain the love of allah azzawajal and allah azzawajal knows best says"
