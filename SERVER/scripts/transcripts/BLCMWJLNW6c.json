  "transcript": "Sheikh, they say it is an emergency. Someone has died four years ago. We were committed for one year and one month, but before his death, we broke up. What can I do for him now? I visit his grave every day. Will he face any hardships? He used to take alcohol, maybe did some haram stuff, but he crashed by a truck. Will he go to Jannah? How can I pray for him? How can I pray for our sins to be forgiven? Instead of visiting his grave, she should stay home, ask Allah to forgive her sins, and to pardon her over what she had done, and to express remorse. Now for us, we should focus on ourselves, showing remorse, asking Allah for forgiveness, and trying to excel to be people that Allah loves and forgives. Allah knows best. Wassalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. JazakumAllahu khayran."
