  "transcript": "the health says some days we have to recite before sleeping are these duels only meant for sleeping in the night only or whenever we sleep do we have to recite this duaa the most authentic opinion is that if you go to sleep at ten o'clock eleven o'clock p.m. you say the drawers of bedtime if you wake up before Fajr and then prefetcher and then want to go back to sleep you're not obliged to make these doors again because you have done it for the night if someone wants to do it just in case more of goodness benefit of the doubt there's nothing wrong in that but we do not oblige people to repeat it once or twice or more when they go back to sleep again"
