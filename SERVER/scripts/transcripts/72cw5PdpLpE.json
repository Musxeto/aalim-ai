  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu May Allah grant you a good life and increase you in beneficial knowledge Ameen and you as well Sheikh my question is I started reading some Islamic books like Mukhalas Al-Fiqh and Al Mulakhas Al-Fiqhi Yeah Al Mulakhas Al-Fiqhi and Masail Al-Jahiliyya and Kashf Al-Shuhabat and such books and my question is when I read them because I have a lot of books I want to like start getting into the knowledge of Islam when I read one book and I move to the other book I forget the book that I read before so I wanted your advice or your help on like what to do so that I can retain the knowledge of the previous book because I have a lot of books and I want to study all of them but I forget what I read before Ammar this is human nature Akhi walhamdulillah we are not machines this happens to all of us when we read something we tend to forget a great deal of it when we move to something else this is human beings we tend to forget but students of knowledge usually note down beautiful tips and issues that they've learnt so a lot of students of knowledge use this methodology when they go through a book if they go in for example page 5 and they find something nice they highlight it and at the back or at the front of the book where there are empty pages they write page 5 and a summary of the point they have noted or learnt and then after finishing reading the book they would have probably filled a page or two or maybe more when they come back five six months later to the book instead of going through it they just scroll down the issues that they've learnt and they found it amusing and it refreshes their memory so they go and check it and it cements itself time after time so I hope that this would be the best thing for you to do from now on inshallah taking notes is very important"
