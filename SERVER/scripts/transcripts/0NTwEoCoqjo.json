  "transcript": "Abdullah from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Abdullah. You are? Abdullah from Germany. Yes sir. Okay so I get student loans in Germany and I have to pay the half back five years after my graduation but only until 10,000 euro so if I get more than 20,000 euro I only have to pay 10,000 euro back and that's also my case I got more than 20,000 euro so actually what I will get fee payment when paying it back but if you don't have enough money you can postpone the repayment without paying interest and so actually you have to pay the late fee only if you have money but don't pay or if you don't tell them that you have that you don't have enough money so my question is can I continue to get these student loans? First of all it is not permissible to get student loans that is riba based so any loan that is offered to you by the government or by any educational institution that requires you to pay them back with one dime extra as riba this is haram whether they say that if you get this much amount as an income after graduation to pay them extra this is haram and it's not permissible for you to opt for such loans. you"
