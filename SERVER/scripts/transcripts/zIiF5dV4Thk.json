  "transcript": "Ibrahimah from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu May Allah grant you good health -  for those And you as well I wanted to ask about Kafara Al-Yameen, I don't know if my pronunciation is correct, about like expiating a vow So I wanted to know if you have let's say two vows or three, let's say more than one vow to expiate And you have to feed ten people Can you give let's say two meals per people for like two vows? Or does it have to be different people or different days? Okay, first of all, I understand you Kafara Al-Yameen or an oath broken Is one of three things Freeing a slave, feeding or clothing ten poor Muslims If financially you can't do any of these three things You move to the alternative which is fasting three days Only if you cannot financially do any of the three things mentioned earlier Now, it is important that every expiation of an oath That you feed ten different people I cannot bring ten meals and give it to the same person for one oath This is totally unacceptable They have to be ten different individuals and they have to be Muslims Old or young, male or female, it doesn't matter If I have more than one expiation Like I said, Wallahi tomorrow I'm not going to drink green tea Tomorrow I'm not going to drink black tea So I have two expiations If I broke them, these oaths and I want to expiate I can bring twenty meals and give two meals to one person of ten different people If I have three meals, I can give them three meals to each one Because these are different expiations So three, three, three, three, three, this total is thirty This is an expiation of three broken oaths But if I broke one oath, I cannot give two meals to five And I say okay, by five equals ten No, it has to be one meal for each individual of the ten And Allah Azzawajal knows best Thanks for watching!"
