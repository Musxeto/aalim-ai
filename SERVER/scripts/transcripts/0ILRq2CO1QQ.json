  "transcript": "Jan from England Jan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam. I just wanted to ask you, is it permissible to play Among Us? It's like a game where you have to pretend to be a murderer and you like kill people and you're like a sussy imposter and basically people have to try to guess who the killer is and it's based on lying. Usually I don't like commenting on video games and games that are online as such because the amount of haram is a lot in it and the people are so hooked into it that your answer might be quite weird to them. Now to me, there are essentials and important things and priorities in life. Are video games part of them? No. Now when we are asked about video games and people say Sheikh there's a game that is based on hijacking or stealing or hot wiring a car and running away from police, it's fun Sheikh. Can we play it? I said these things in real life, are they halal or haram? It's haram. Okay what about killing one another Sheikh? We are teams and we kill and shoot, it's a shooting game and we kill one another and we hide in a maze and when we find our opponent we kill him and he has a name and we know him. What's the ruling on killing in Islam? Sheikh it's a game. So if there's a game based on rape and you can keep on raping people, is that fun? It's a game. No. Haram in real life is haram also in virtual life because this is how you're brainwashed, this is how you're set. Why do we say Allahu Akbar more than 300 times a day? Why do you say praise be to Allah? Why do you say glorified is Allah Azza wa Jal? This is heart washing not brainwashing because it elevates you and gets you closer to Allah. The opposite is the same when you only listen to rap music that praises killing and looting and drugs and women or you play such games that legitimizes such haram activities then this is what you end up doing and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. you"
