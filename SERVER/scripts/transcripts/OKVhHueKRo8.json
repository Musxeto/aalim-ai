  "title": "Every Friday we get 'Jummah Mubarak' messages, shall we rely to them or is this a Sin?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, every Friday we say Jum'ah Mubarak and say this. Should we reply to them or is this a sin? No, don't reply to them. It's not from the Sunnah. Every single Friday, Jum'ah Mubarakah. Or someone sends you, Allahumma Salli Wa Sallim Ala Muhammad. Or sends you a story about the Prophet, what he did. Every single Friday, why not Thursday? Why not Saturday? This is an innovation. Because this was not done at the time of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. But, they have their justification. If someone sends it to you, don't reply back. If someone meets you after Khutbah, and says, Akhi, Salam Alaikum, Jum'ah Mubarakah. What should I do? Spit in his face. No. He says, Jum'ah Mubarakah, Jazak Allah Khair. That's it. Don't say, Jum'ah Mubarakah to you. This is not from the Sunnah. Anyone who says something out of bid'ah to you, you don't have to reply. Just say, thank you and move on. But you do not initiate it by no means. And Allah knows best."
