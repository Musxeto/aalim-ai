  "transcript": "Hoss nein says is it mandatory to wash our private parts for making wood after we pass wind or is a sting juh part of woudl sting juh is the action of washing the private parts after answering the call of nature to cleanse ourselves after relieving ourselves whether after urinating or defecating we either wash with water the private parts until there is no trace of impurity of Najah so all we use solid substances such as a stone a rock or paper tissues or anything the like to wipe and cleanse the area so Hasnain says is it mandatory to wash after passing wind the answer is no it's neither mandatory nor voluntary nor recommended actually it is prohibited and an innovation and this is what most if not all scholars of Islam agree upon this is an innovation but it because it was never ever advised or recommended in Islam and why do we say an innovation because allah azza wajal says in the quran alone today Akmal tilikum d nakum i completed for you the religion and my favorite is also complete and I have accepted Islam to be your religion this was revealed to our prophet alayhi salatu salam on the tenth year of hijra in had Kjetil wada in the farewell pilgrimage so if Allah says today I have completed your religion this means what this means that the religion was completed at the time of the Prophet Alice awesome for you to come and innovate and bring up new things and say that this is good it's best for your purity you pass when you wash this is an innovation to my knowledge only the zaydis of the Shia do this and they also before performing Woodill and this is the second part of his names question is a stingy part of woudl so I want to pray I'm going to perform ablution do I have to wash my private parts this is what the the idea of the Shia do the vast majority of Muslims never ever attempt to do this why would I wash my private parts I did not urinate I did not defecate so what's the point the answer is there's no point and as Muslims we do not do this simply perform model and go and pray and Allah knows best"
