  "transcript": "is having a career plan or high ambition permissible in islam if not then what should i do as i have some ambitions like higher studies and so on the question is not clear no one has ever said that pursuing a phd degree is not recommended in islam or becoming an owner of a company or a ceo or an influential person in the society all of these are recommended and permissible with conditions number one you don't do anything haram so if you're studying something to get your phd then this is haram if you need to bend some rules if not break them in order to reach a post or a position in the government such as lying bribing cheating etc this is hara such ambitions will take you straight to hell if you in order to become a ceo of a company you need to deal in riba and do haram transactions and maybe cheat this is totally haram other than that if your everything is legit the sky is the limit"
