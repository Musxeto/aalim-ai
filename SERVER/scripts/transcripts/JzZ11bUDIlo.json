  "transcript": "uh Benjamin from Bosnia so yesterday my laptop crashed before I asked the full question it was um if a person was a false Muslim in uh before but then uh he became an actual Muslim and practicing Muslim uh would that person fall under the umbrella that when someone accepts and practices Islam that all of this previous person's uh sins would be forgiven basically yes if a person was a cfir and then he accepted Islam wholeheartedly then Allah would transform his sins into good deeds and this is in Allah's hands we should not Ponder and reflect upon the past so that we would stop living in the past rather we should progress and move forward with life so as long as that person has found his way to Islam back again and now he's practicing and remorseful he should keep on moving forward and Allah Knows Best"
