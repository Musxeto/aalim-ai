  "title": "Is the navel & knees part of a manâ€™s awrah or not? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh zanar from the uk says is the belly button the navel and the knees part of the aura or not it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion as this is the opinion of imam nawawi and also the uh opinion of sheikh rahmatullahi they say that it is what's between the naval and knees so the naval itself and the knees themselves are not aura the area between them is so as long as you're wearing swimsuits for example that is just to the line of the navel or just underneath it and above the knee this is legit there's no problem in that providing that nothing more is exposed so it's if part of your thighs get exposed and this usually happens when a person sits down the pants themselves or the swimsuit themselves go up a little bit and expose his thigh this is haram and this is not permissible but the knees and the navel are not from the aura"
