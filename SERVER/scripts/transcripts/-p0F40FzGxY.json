  "title": "Zakat on 4 Categories of Wealth | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "so what are the four categories of wealth that i'm supposed to pay zakat see if i tell you and explain it to you you don't have to come back to me and ask me questions it's best for me to teach you how to fish rather than to give you a fish every single day whether hamur or najib doesn't make any difference therefore um how much time do you have left uh we have three minutes but uh i think this is an important question so you might kill many birds with one stone okay okay so you need to understand the concept of everything you do so you don't have to come back to me uh i would like to pray in the masjid but i have a cigarette packet in in my pocket so does this now defy my wudu excuse me yeah i know cigarette says haram so i smoke a cigarette should i renew my wudu if you know that wudhu is broken by one two three four five then any time i bring you six or seven or eight or ten you say no this doesn't break wudu only these five things break buddha so khalas now you have a fish you know how to fish likewise when we come to zakat what should i place a cat on oh i have three plots in india or sheikh i have bought a house and mortgage should i pay the car oh sheikh my wife is getting um an investment with so and so once you understand what are the wealth to give zakat on you've got it made you don't need to ask a sheikh what are the things that we have to give zakat on four things number one you can write it down if you wish who cares who's watching i don't think that but anybody watching anyhow gold and silver these are the two most important minerals and and metals in the world because all finances and currencies revolve around them since the beginning of time and it will at the end of the time so any gold or silver or what carries the role of gold and silver such as banknotes currency this is category one you have to give zakat conditions threshold one year possession etc does this include women's jewelry it's an issue of dispute whether they're wearing it or not but the most authentic opinion is even the jewellery they have to be paid because gold and silver is the essence of economy in the world category number two livestock cattle camels cows and buffalos sheep and goats these have conditions sheikh we don't have any livestock can you move on no problem but if you had you have to come and ask me and i'll tell you how many cows how many sheep how many uh camels that you're supposed to give what are the conditions of that because if i have a farm of 100 sheep the threshold of sheep is 40. so i have a farm of 100. do i give the cat no it should be grazing from allah's plans around but if i buy the grass for it to eat there's no zakat in it but this is not our point number one gold silver and currency number two livestock number three vegetables or fruit or corn or uh um what they call it seeds what is habu i don't know who cares things that are what the what grains or seeds is fine grains yeah yeah grains accent very good yeah i'm not practicing english so i'm forgetting it i think i should get married again anyhow i'm just joking um so grains corn wheat barley dates and raisin these are zakatable if i have a farm so if i have oranges no zakat apples nose a cat tomatoes nose a cat watermelons no zakat and there are conditions of course whether i am watering it myself or it's being watered from the heavens from the skies or half half this is a different chair we don't have forms okay let's skip that category number four whatever is prepared for trade meaning i sell and buy and sell and buy so my money is actually being invested in a grocery shop uh can i have some cheese you go and i buy another and put in this place so it the wealth keeps on revolving increasing and i'm getting profit out of that anything that is prepared for trade is the catabol right let's a little bit focus on this uh can you explain a little bit elaborate no problem you've just said that i have three plots i have a house that i'll be possessing in six years time and you said there's no zakat neither on the installments nor on the plot yeah i said read my lips i'm not angry but who cares i said that these items must be devoted solely for making money selling buying selling buying so if i have my car and someone comes to me and says wow beautiful car would you sell it i didn't have any intention prior to that for selling it so i said i don't know said i'll give you a hundred thousand reals and the car is worth fifty thousand a hundred thousand done deal man alhamdulillah go so do i have pays a cat nope sure you just sold it yes i sold it not to make money and buy another one and auction it for sale and buy another one and another one no if someone comes to me and says your head scarf is is very beautiful by the way this is from kuwait i bought it a couple of years ago and i need a replacement so i have to come to kuwait soon because this is the only place it's sold in anyhow i don't know mubaraki or hamidi i don't know what's going on so someone says i love your headscarf would you take a hundred dollars for it hundred dollars take it it's not for sale but i'm selling it because i got a good proposal this is different than someone like myself having a showroom and i get cars from the dubai from germany from los angeles and i put them and i sell cars and then the money i get i buy other cars so the rotation is for making money going back to the original question i have three plots in india do i pay the cat what is the purpose of owning them well i don't know i got a bonus five years ago so i bought one and last year i saw it cheap i bought it and now i have a third one so what is your intention are you displaying it for people and real estate agents to buy from you i want this price to sell no no no i may build a house i may build a building and rent it i may invest it in the future i may give it to my some of my children there's no zakat okay what about the plot or the building i'm paying installments for six years if you have the cash money in your hand and a full year rotates while you're possessing it in order to pay it you have to give zakat but if not i don't have any savings every year just before the deadline i say from my salary and i give it to the con contractor or the construction agency okay after six years what happens the house is mine are you doing this to sell it and make money and then buy another house no no no i want to live in it there's no zakat not on the solomon's nor on the real estate itself so i hope this teaches you how to fish it's like a lockheed that really clarifies a lot of points and what i wrote just to recap is that number one where we have to pay zakat gold and silver are equivalent number two is the livestock uh with conditions as you said number three is farm vegetables grains dates and raisins specifically and number four which was not let me let me interrupt you not all farm vegetables cucumbers lettuce etc these things no the condition is that it should be uh weight size or weight and it can be saved stored so dates i can store them for a whole year the raisins they're dry i can store them grains i can store them but anything that is fresh lemon oranges uh watermelon all of these are unzikatable for clarification and the last point number four which is pertinent to many questions actually that uh uh jalakala for you have answered mashallah whatever is prepared for trade is zakat eligible wealth where wealth keeps on revolving so i think that defies it we have run over time and we really appreciate your time here ship for the community we really miss you here in kuwait hopefully once the restrictions are down then we would like to welcome you here again uh you are part of this community part of this family i would like to also thank all the attendees here uh we have answered uh i think more than 45 50 questions here but still there are about 30 pending i apologize that we could not take it but inshallah next time for your time for having me and i wish all the community in kuwait and elsewhere to have a safe ramadan and i pray to allah that he uplifts this illness and this disease and this tribulation and calamity from all of humanity and specifically from the muslims and restores our safety and our well-being so that we can meet insha allah again assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi"
