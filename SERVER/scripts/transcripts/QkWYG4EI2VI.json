  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan. Saad. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam. Sheikh, how do we wash our ears in wudu? You don't. In wudu, we're not supposed to wash our ears. In wudu, we have to wipe, not wash, which means that wet fingers. I insert my index finger in my ear and my thumb is behind my ear and I do this and that is enough."
