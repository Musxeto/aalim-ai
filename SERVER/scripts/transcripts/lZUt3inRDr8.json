  "transcript": "what is this yes sir my question is brother has twoes uh one wife is staying with him in uh Dubai and the other wife is staying in M the second wife what is the ruling on that kind of a setup where he is in wife for 6 months and comes back TOA for one two months and goes back to the other wife and the question the other question comes back to the first question that a brother from the front asked you about buing a Muslim in the coffin he were kind of trying to answer that and it was to the selling part I wanted I me I was re you enlight and elaborate on that particular part what you were saying telling us about the Bing part first of all when a person has two wives it's an obligation upon him to be fair in the following one the amount of time shared to the expenditure how much he spends on gifts and the likes so if his marriage was based on an agreement which is usually not the case his first wife is from Kenya and his second wife is from Dubai but he works in the Emirates because he has to earn a living so his wife cannot leave the kids and his family and his parents most likely she's living with them and come with because of the expenses so out of convenience he had to get married so his marriage and the lack of Distributing the time is not due because he loves it and enjoys it rather due to inability to divide six month here and six month there so in this case it is permissible for him to live like this as long as he's dealing with Allah because the only one who judges him is Allah if he can spend more time with the woman in Kenya but he likes to spend it in Dubai because it's trouble-free she doesn't have kids and he's always having fun and she's young and she's probably Ukrainian he's got problems so this is Yeah question number one or the second wife which is a Kenan says you have card blunch go I need to see you only once a month one month a year alhamdulillah if she lets go of her rights that's very win-win uh uh case"
