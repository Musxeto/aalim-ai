  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India. May Allah reward you with the highest reward. And \nyou as well. Sheikh, I ate food from a restaurant   knowing that it has very high chance of containing \nnutmeg and I also had drinks like Pepsi and cola   which according to one Paris based research \ncontain small amount of alcohol. Now I know   that I have to pray all my prayers even though as \na punishment for having nutmeg and alcohol it will   not be accepted for forty days. But if I regret \nand repent sincerely and pray the two rakats of   repentance will Allah still reject that prayer \nand other prayers after the repentance? What I   mean to say is, can I repent for this sin or any \nother sin during this forty day period? Yes, you   can repent and you have to repent immediately from \nany sin you commit and not wait for forty days or   more or less. You have to repent immediately. \nNow, whether Allah will accept this or not,   this is in His hands. All what you have to do is \nto show remorse, to show sincerity and to pledge   not to do that sin again and to do good deeds \nthinking positively of Allah. Allah is the most   merciful, most forgiving. So, you do your best \nand hope for the best and Allah is most generous.   Subhanahu wa Azza wa Jal."
