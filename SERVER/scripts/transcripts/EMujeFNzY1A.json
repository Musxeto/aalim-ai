  "title": "Why do we say As salamu 'alaykum plural, even when only ONE person is addressed",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. My question, my question was that and that when we meet a single person, singular person, then we say him Assalamu Alaikum. Then why it is Assalamu Alaikum? Because we are saying to a singular person. Why we don't say Assalamu Alaika? Because there are angels in the room present and there might be jinn who are Muslims present. So and we may respect that individual. So I don't address a father or a prime minister or a king by saying, hey dude what's cooking? I do respect him by making it plural. This is known in Arabic. But beside the point, even if he's younger than you, you say Assalamu Alaikum because there are angels present as well and you intend that for everyone present."
