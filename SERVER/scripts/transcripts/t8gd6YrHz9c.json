  "title": "Is the prohibition of wearing a Ring on the Index & Middle Finger only for Men",
  "transcript": "[Music] there is a hadith about prohibition wiring a ring in the middle finger and the index finger is this prohibition only for boys or the girls also i will answer from bangladesh what's the ruling on wearing the ring in the index finger and in the middle finger in the bass in said the prophet islam prohibited us from wearing the rings in the index finger and in the middle finger so it's prohibited for a muslim to wear the rings in these two fingers the vast majority of scholars say that this prohibition is only for males females are exempted why because females nature dictates that they adorn themselves and unless something is specific then all types of adornment of themselves is hada including wearing the rings in the middle or the index finger now if a woman says i have two more fingers that i can wear my rings in so i'd rather do that instead of doing something that might be dubious may allah reward you nobody says that you're wrong but if you see women wearing it don't condemn them or look down upon them because they have not done something wrong and allah knows best you"
