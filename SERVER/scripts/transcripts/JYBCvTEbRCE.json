  "title": "Are good deeds multiplied in Ramadan? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "jahida shahida says whoever does something good in this month that is Ramadan Allah multiplies it by how many times share first of all we do not have an authentic hadith of multiplying the good deeds meaning if I pay 1 rial I will get 100 or 700 reals generally speaking deeds are more preferred in Ramadan than other months because of the blessed time for example the Prophet said that is awesome performing or Umrah in Ramadan is equivalent to performing Hajj this is the authentic hadith some people say equivalent to performing Hajj with me the prophet of Allah and this is not authentic so be careful so when umbra is equivalent to hatch wow that's a great reward only in Ramadan also we know that lailatul utter is better than a thousand months and this is equivalent to 80 plus years because Allah social knew that we are weak and vulnerable and that we are not able to do a lot of good deeds so he substituted us with this blessed night and if we do good deeds allah azzawajal would magnify our deeds that is prayer etc in it but can we say that if I give my zakat in Ramadan it is multiplied no if I offer this or that I can multiply it we need evidence and we don't have authentic evidence but definitely the Salaf used to consider doing good deeds in Ramadan much more rewarding than anything else and Allah knows best"
