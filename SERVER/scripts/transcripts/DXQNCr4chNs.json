  "transcript": "the second question is about the 73 sects his friend says this is a fabricated hadith your friend is fabricated himself the hadith is authentic you don't come to a doctor and he says to you you need to have a surgery and he said no no no the procedure is wrong are you a doctor yourself do you know hadith sciences yourself do you know even arabic yourself that says no but i heard someone saying that it is not uh authentic who's that someone he's a person of innovation most likely he's someone who's deviant we have scholars of hadith who had spent like 40 50 years of their lives studying the hadith and preserving the sunnah like and you come with a check of a pen and cross them over no this is totally insane so you brother ahmad should be wiser and not speak with such imbeciles if he has concrete evidence if he knows arabic if he knows the sciences of hadiths and he shows you in black and white this uh narration is module it's fabricated due to the existence of this particular narrator the chain of narrators is not authentic it's not connected it's naive it's this and that that's a different story but to just sit on your uh couch and just say that yeah i don't like the hadith it's fabricated and the jews put it no this is totally insane and not islamic"
