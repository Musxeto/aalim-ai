  "transcript": "about the question uh the ruling uh of people who are buying the farmer and i didn't ask the whole question due to the connection so i also wanted to know if these people follow the hadith who where the prophet salallahu said whoever claims to belong to someone other than his father or a freed slave who claims that his wealth is for others and his real master the curse of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala the angels and all the people will be upon him from germany he says my question yesterday was about those who obtain their residency or national nationality through lying and the line was interrupted what i meant to say would they fall in the curse of the prophet alaihis salatu for changing their father's name and their family name that says of course anyone who changes his father name or family name is cursed by allah and among those are women who change their names after marriage to their in-laws name so she was chodri her father name she changed into han she falls under this curse because the prophet told us haslam it's totally prohibited to change your family name and your lineage oh sheikh we do this for the purpose of marriage it's still haram and it's still a major sin so if a person goes to europe to germany and chain in in forges documents claims to be from this nationality and a different name for himself father and the family all of this is sinful and he's cursed for that"
