  "title": "When can I make up Sunnah of Fajr if I came late to the masjid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Fahim from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, if I come late to the masjid in Fajr and I was unable to pray the two rak'ah of sunnah, when should I pray it? Should it be just after the salam or I can take time after reciting my adhkar? Okay, so if a person misses the sunnah of Fajr which was supposed to be performed before the fard, he has the concession and the right to offer them after the Fajr prayer, providing he changes his position or speaks to someone else. Now the sunnah is that he finishes his adhkar if he wishes and then pray his sunnah afterwards. And also he can wait until the sun rises and prays his sunnah afterwards. Both are fine and acceptable inshallahu azzawajal."
