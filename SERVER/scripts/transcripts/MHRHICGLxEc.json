  "transcript": "ESMA says I want to learn Ricky and pranic healing and use it for serving people is it allowed in Islam what if we don't call upon anyone else than Allah and use Islamic prayers instead of theirs the origin of Ricky and this pranic healing to my knowledge is dependent on teachings of Buddhism and it is used to promote Buddhism and it talks about the cosmic powers not Allah it talks about the universal energy it talks about your Chi and so many things that go in your body that they convince their followers through different types of mind manipulation of saying things doing things that you can do healing by touching and utilizing the flow of the Chi in the body and your breathing techniques etc all of this is Una's lamech and it is Haram and it can take a person to you cannot combine the two Islamic teachings with this because the origin of the concept itself is Buddhism and this so-called cosmic power or universal energy or the Chi or whatever in your body so you think that this has an impact and effect on your life and this is totally prohibited Muslims believe in medication medicine is Hallett Muslims believe in Islamic means and forms of healing such as rupiah with the Quran or with the supplications said such as honey utilization copying blackseed etc all of these can be utilized to cure but not the Ricky order pranic healing concept"
