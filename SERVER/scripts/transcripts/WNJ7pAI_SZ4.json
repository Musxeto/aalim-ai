  "title": "Giving Dawah on Social Media (facebook, twitter, etc) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Junaid says can one give Dawa to friends on social media if one has the knowledge to do it both in case of Muharram and then Muharram friends and can I do it for some of my friends post on Islamic if some of my friends post on Islamic things or spread false news regarding Islam can I message them or not first of all social media is something that a lot of us are involved in however there are ground rules that we must abide by and without any doubt social media platforms are one of the easiest gateways of Shaitaan to penetrate our hearts and corrupt it therefore whenever we want to look into this issue we have to look at the circumstances we have to look at the individual we have to look at the pros and cons and accordingly then we can look and analyze whether one should go in or refrain general speaking if there is no mixing on these social media platforms meaning that you post something you answer a question to the public there isn't a private message between a man and a woman everything is on display there is no inappropriate language used no flirting no chit chatting it's just straight that wa like what a lot of the Diaries and scholars have Q&A for example sessions so a question and an answer there is no problem in that ish Allah everybody is looking and watching but if feels that I'd like to message you privately and he answers the message privately and his heart is inclined to listening to the whispers of Shaitaan this is not at all permissible it is always best that women give dower to other women and men give dower to other men without allowing Shaitaan to penetrate in between and to make his turmoil secondly if someone posts something that it goes against Islam it is our duty to try and give advice to prohibit evil and vice to try to clarify things to people but if the platform itself is not suitable if it's a blog if it is a Facebook page that 99% are anti Islamic people don't even care about reading what they post because it's only kills and hardens and tarnishes your heart there alone replying to them they will keep on barking like all the hounds of hell so leave them and move on but if there is someone who's seeking knowledge who is interested in a clarification to a doubt that he has in this case yes if someone you know posted something that is Haram so many times we get these haram videos of women who are not abiding by the hijab of eclipsed with music sent to us by even sometimes righteous people thinking that this is halal sometimes they claim and I've seen this from some of the Diaries they claim that they're above the law meaning that if they send us a video with women who are not abiding by the hijab uncovered hair etc and we say hey this is not right to spread and send to us he says that well we have passed that error and we are far ahead of fearing such trivial things are you - Billa this is Satan's whispering in our ears giving us the impression that we are above all doubts and that we can bend if not break some of the rules may Allah preserve us all"
