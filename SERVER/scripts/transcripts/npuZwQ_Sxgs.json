  "transcript": "ahmed from the uk i asked you on i think the website regarding and if uh because i was told by someone um that i have to cover like every single inch every single place and i've i'll see this on the website but i didn't quite understand what he meant by the dust hasn't doesn't need to reach every place like i was told that i have to touch my chin my like the like like like a you're the light your hairline oh like do i have to do this or can i just like wipe without worrying about what i have to touch i will answer inshallah but from the uk he said he asked me a question on the on on my website and his question was somebody said if you make tayammum and you dust your hands you have to wash or wipe every single detail of your face and this is bogus where did they get this from there's a difference i can't see you actually let me see okay now i can see there's a difference between wiping and washing for example and what do i have to wipe over my head do you think that every strand of my hair would become wet of course not ninety percent of course not i'm wiping not washing likewise when i'm dusting my hands and want to perform to em i just wipe i don't have to go in the small details here and here and here no just wait that's it once it's not dusting and you just keep on wiping and let me get some more and what are you doing this is not halloween it's just once you do this you do this in some of the hadith it's this so that not a lot of dust would be there and you either do your hands first and on face or do your face first and your hands and both are too different authentic opinion for the scholars to fo for you to follow so i hope this answers your question"
