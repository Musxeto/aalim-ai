  "transcript": "and har says I wanted to know if I'm on my period during a little cutter how can I take advantage of it as they cannot fast and I cannot pray it's true that you cannot pray fasting is done only on the daytime so from Maverick till fetcher if you are unable to pray you're able to do everything else you can read the Quran you can make vicar you can make dua you can engage in so many good things other than the prayer so the sky is the limit feeding the people who are in need helping others helping your parents in the house making vicar reading the Quran reading a lot of the Quran would definitely compensate for your inability to pray"
