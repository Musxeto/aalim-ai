  "transcript": "Saleha from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My mother-in-law is reward. She has this bangle. She is asking this question. It is permissible to wear bangles which Hindu woman wear and they think that this bangle protect their husband from any calamity. And this bangles shows that they are married. Jazakallahu Khairan If bangles are the normal bracelets made of gold, of thick gold that all women wear around the world, this is not a Hindu practice. So it's like saying, what's the ruling on wearing earrings? All women wear earrings. Unfortunately, even semi-men nowadays wear earrings. Those who consider themselves to be males, unfortunately you see them wearing earrings. This is not permissible in Islam at all. No Muslim man would ever wear earrings or a bracelet or a necklace. This is only for women. But this is beside the point. So what's the ruling on women wearing earrings? This is halal. Likewise, what's the ruling on women wearing bangles or thick bracelets of gold? Maybe three or four of them. This is totally normal and permissible as long as you do not have any feeling related to shirk. Such as, these protect my husband, my children, because then they become as amulets. And this is regardless of the point, whether it's a Hindu belief or any other religion's belief. And Allah knows best."
