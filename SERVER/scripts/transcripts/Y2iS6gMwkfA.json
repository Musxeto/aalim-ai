  "title": "If a person dies by a falling object, is he a Martyr like who dies in a collapsed building?",
  "transcript": "[Music] and namira from georgia uh i wanted to know like uh the hadi states that um if a person dies by a wall which falls on his head he is considered a martyr so uh does anything falling on the head be is considered like a pole or anything like if he's crushed under anything okay i will answer inshallah namira from georgia she says i've heard the hadith where the prophet said allah a person who dies under a collapsing building is a martyr so does that mean anything that falls and kills a person would be considered the same the answer is no the hadith is specifically mentioning a collapsing uh building because people who die under a collapsed building would not usually die instantly they would suffer they would be locked for days without food and drinks maybe without air and then they die such suffering elevates their situation to martyrdom inshallah unlike if a person was walking under a skyscraper and somebody drops a rock and it falls on his head and kills him he did not die under a collapsed building so would not share the same reward and allah knows best you"
