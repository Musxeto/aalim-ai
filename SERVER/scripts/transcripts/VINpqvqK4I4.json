  "title": "The Muslims, from being at the top of the world to a People Looked Down Upon - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "The 1 2 3 4 that you write it's called as Arabic numerals introduced by the Muslims. We learn in school about the Pythogus theorem that in a triangle the square of the hypotenus the longest side is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides. Who was the first person who propounded that? Nasaredin althusi Muslim. We learn about trigonometry in school. Who's the father of trigonormity? Aluruni Muslim. At the time when New Galileo and Descartis when they said all laws are absolute, Al Kindi at that time said they are relative. All laws are not absolute. Later on Albert Einstein comes centuries later and propounds speaks about theory of relativity and people accept it. So in a school book we read about Albert Einstein we don't read about Alchi. Alindi much before Albert Einstein he proposed the theory of relativity. We know of the three brothers Muhammad, Ahmed, Hassan Shakir who at the degree of the Red Sea they told the surface area of the earth at a time when people thought that the earth was flat. At a time when people thought the earth was flat, they said it is spherical. And they told the surface area of the earth at that time, centuries ago, which if you compare with today's knowledge, it's quite accurate, very close to it. In the field of chemistry, who is the father of chemistry? We are told is gber. It's not gber, it is jabir. Jabber. They latinize the Arabic word jab into gber. So we think it's a westerner. The father of MST is not ger it is jabir jabiran and he distilled alcohol and he used it from the Arabic word alul meaning evil spirit. You're the first person who did it. He's called the father of chemistry. We know about Mohammad Zakaria Razi who wrote the treatment of smallpox and measles. History and science tells us today that Ali Abbas Ali Aabbas wrote 20 volumes on theory and practice of medicine. You know very often we hear Avisina Aristotle of the east aisina. It's not a it's alibina. Aina sounds like a western name. It's Alibina. He was called as the aristotal of the east. So there are examples when Muslims on top of the world in science and technology from the 8th to the 12th century and close to that we were on top of the world. But today we look at the Muslims everyone is harassing us. Everyone is looking down on us. Why? At that time the Muslims were close to the Quran and Sunnah. So because we were close to the Quran and Sunnah and because we were following the guidance of Allah and his rasool, we were on top of the world. Today we Muslims have gone away from Quran and Sunnah and that's the reason we are in this position today. We are looked down upon. We are being harassed everywhere in the world. And as our beloved prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that when you choose your life partner you seek for four things beauty, wealth, nobility and virtue. Dean, religion and the best is religion. And I remember in the early '90s when I was 25 years old I and I was inspired by Shik Ahmed if you know my background. I was involved in the field of dawa. I was a full-time D. I wanted a life partner who's also D virtue. I'm I wasn't bothered about beauty. I wasn't bothered about wealth. I was in pos of nobility. I wanted virtuous D. That was my only criteria, one criteria. And for a couple of years, two three years and my sister she was you know trying to find was after she find otherwise I'm not going to look at it. She'll find then she'll maybe take the preliminary interview and I could not find any for 2 three years. No one. Finally in the city of Pune 160 kilometers from Bombay where I live heard of a girl and we went and we met and alhamdulillah first girl I saw and alhamdulillah she was virtuous and he married her. I'm telling you the story because during the interview I asked a question one question I asked many questions. One of the questions I asked her was if someone gives you 10 lakh rupees what will you do with it? So she told me that time that was in 1993 1992 I took the interview. We got married in 1993 May 16th of 1992 that we had the interview a few months before marriage and she said if I someone give me 10 lak rupees 10 lak rupees about 1 million rupees I will make an Islamic school. I said mashallah very"
