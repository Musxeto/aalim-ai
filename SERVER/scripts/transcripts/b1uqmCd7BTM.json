  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Germany Sheikh is it permissible to open an \naccount in an interest-based bank   even if there's an Islamic bank. So is it an Islamic bank or \nan interest-based bank or   a mixture where it has this \nbranch and this branch? Well it is basically it's just an interest-based \nbank but about - 11 kilometres Islamic bank. So you're asking about two different banks? No, if it is permissible to open \nan account in the interest-based   bank because I read in IslamQA it's not \npermissible if there's an Islamic bank. And you don't have any Islamic banks around? But it's unfortunately about \n11, 12 kilometres away. Okay, I will answer Insha Allah. [Questioner] from Germany, I've read that \nit is not permissible to have an account   with an interest-based bank when there \nis an alternative in an Islamic bank. This is the fatwa, however the bank that is \nIslamic is far away from my home and there is   a lot of hardship for me to do this, so what is \nthe solution? In my opinion, if there is a lot of   hardship upon you, as in your case it's very far, \nand you need to do a lot of banking transactions,   withdrawals, and that would cost you money, \nand time and effort to go to that bank   or the Islamic bank is not a professional \nbank, their transactions are lousy,   they are always late, they're not professional, \nthey don't deliver, and a lot of the time they   cause me hardship, if this is the case, I believe \nthat it is permissible to open an account   with an interest-based bank providing that it is \na current account, so there is no interest in it,   plus you don't put a lot of money in it, so you \nhave both accounts, you leave the chunk of savings   in the Islamic bank, and you leave an amount \nsufficient for your daily transactions and   wire transfers and cash withdrawals   to the minimum so that the bank would \nnot benefit from it and Allah knows best."
