  "title": "MUSLIMS being Racist towards Black People?  ðŸ˜³assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh In light of the hadith about Bilal, in regards to racism, there is a lot of racism against black people everywhere and that's okay because, you know, people are ignorant. But when racism comes from the Muslims, and it is very natural to dislike someone that is racist towards your ethnicity, how do we deal with the fact that these are Muslims and we still have to love our brothers and sisters and the racism is right in your face at the same time? Of course, without any doubt, the mistake coming from a non-Muslim is far less in gravity than when this mistake happens from a Muslim. If a Muslim gives a derogatory comment or a racist comment, this is far greater than a non-Muslim doing the same. Because a non-Muslim has no boundaries. They don't have any things to restrict them. While Muslims have their beliefs, have Qur'an, have Sunnah, have the fear of Allah. Unfortunately, your fingers are not the same length. They're not alike. And likewise, Muslims. There are Muslims who are practising. There are Muslims who are practising but not fully. There are Muslims who are not practising. And there are Muslims who are not Muslims except by name. So we as individuals have to rise up and not be affected by such negative comments. As I always, always, always say, when you're walking down the streets and a dog starts to bark at you, you will never fall on your hands and knees and bark back. Because you're a human being, you're not a dog. So when such specimens of people treat you in a racist fashion, it kills them softly when you pay no attention to their comments or their racist rhetoric or their behaviour. If you turn the table on their heads and when they make such racist comments, you reply by making a joke, it will kill them. Because they were expecting and anticipating a negative reaction. You becoming angry, you're cursing them or saying bad things about them. When you make fun of it and you laugh or you simply ignore, it kills them softly. So be the better person and ignore the dogs that bark."
