  "transcript": "uh zara dean from uk says how can i be a good righteous practicing child for my parents well to be righteous and practicing you have to follow the quran the sunnah to be a good dutiful obedient and respectful child for your parents you have to please them and to combine between the both because you cannot separate them the priority comes to quran and sunnah the priority comes to following the religion of allah the priority comes for sharia so you can combine both by obeying them by being respectful by being dutiful within the boundaries of sharia so you make them happy while practicing the deen and not crossing the line if this pleases them so if they want you not to pray fajr and this pleases them you must disobey them because in this you're displeasing allah azza if you want if they want you to go with them shopping this is this pleases them there's nothing haram in that so go ahead with them if they want you to become healthier by eating healthy food which you do not like but you know that it's good for you then doing it is also part of obeying allah azza and they would love that uh from you inshallah you"
