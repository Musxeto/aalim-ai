  "transcript": "the pledge between the people of Medina and our prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam was come to us to medina before you reach medina we are not responsible to whatever happens to you because you're on their way we don't have any protection for you the minute you reach Medina we will protect you as if we are protecting our own families and children so this meant that if the Prophet Salla salem reaches medina he is in the protection of the people of medina of al ansar and this is the label this is a name al ansar this is the supporters means the supporters of the Prophet SAW Salim and it's a label that the Prophet SAW Salim also gave the glad tiding to them by saying that no believer would ever hate the Ansar and it's a sign of Eman and of belief to love them and it's a sign and of hypocrisy to hate them so whoever hates the Ansar is not a believer is not a movement is not a faith for a better person of faith"
