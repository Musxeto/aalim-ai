  "title": "Are Fatwas ONE SIZE FITS ALL",
  "transcript": "but the fatwa differs from one person to the other fatwa is not for laymen it's not for you and him and me and others it's for the scholars and this is why you may hear a fatwa for an individual and may may hear the same opposite of this fatwa for another individual although the case is the same that is mindblowing but this is what happens a man came to Abdullah Abbas may Allah be pleased with him the cousin of the Prophet one of the greatest Scholars of the Companions and he said to him if a man kills another is there any room for repentance he said yes half an hour later another man comes and he says if a man kills another is there any room for repentance he said no his stent students were shocked said whoa come on same exact identical question one you said yes one you said no why now IB Abbas is the Muti so he said the first man came with tears filling his eyes and remorse apparent on his face I knew he killed someone so he's asking for a way out to repent to Allah to ask for forgiveness I would not return him away from Allah's forgiveness so I said yes and this is to all Sinners I didn't do anything wrong the other man came with Sparks coming from his eyes and Vengeance traces and I knew that he was attempting to kill someone but he wanted an Alaba he wanted an excuse so I said no there is no repentance so that I would block him from going ahead with his crime so it differs and it's not appropriate to go and ask the Sheikh why did you say this and sometimes people come to you and they don't even speak Arabic they don't read the Quran they don't know an Ayah of the Quran said what's your Del so okay I'll give you a Del maybe I I'll quote you some poetry would that be sufficient you wouldn't understand so I hope this answers the question"
