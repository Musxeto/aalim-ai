  "transcript": "Khurram from Pakistan. Khurram. Suleyha from India. Suleyha. Ruqaiya from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh my question is, is digital music allowed in Islam? Any type of music is prohibited in Islam. Whether it is played on string devices or instruments like guitar, violin, tuba or whatever they call that, or it's played on brass, horns, saxophones and flutes and the likes, or played on pianos, synthesizers, keyboards, all of this, or generated by the computer, all of this is prohibited and haram in Islam because Allah Azza Wa Jal prohibited that as mentioned in three verses of the Qur'an, and it is mentioned in the authentic hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and elsewhere that musical instruments are prohibited in Islam. Therefore, all types of music is prohibited and haram. So, if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
