  "transcript": "Sumaya from the UK my question is I don't know I'm getting some discharges and I don't know if they're pure and I don't know if they're continuous so how do I know how do I measure okay first of all if you don't know how would I know and usually women have what is known as vaginal discharge and this comes throughout the day and the night without any illness without any reason and some Scholars give it the similarity of sweat so it's like sweating so such normal regular vaginal discharges the scholars say that they do not break the wudu and they are not nudges or impure because if they wear the prophet would have identified this and warned the women folk from it and the women Folk of the companions would have addressed this and made that known to all women which they didn't so this is why the default is that it is pure and it's not coming out from the urinary passage as some Scholars say now if you doubt that these are not the normal vaginal discharges rather they are signs of infection or any other illness you have to check with your OG obgc your doctor basically and she would be able to do some tests and tell you about it and Allah Knows Best"
