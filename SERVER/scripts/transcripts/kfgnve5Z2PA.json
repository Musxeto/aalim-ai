  "title": "Is it Permissible to Be Called Hajji? (The Accepted Hajj)",
  "transcript": "The accepted Hajj is the one \nthat fulfils the conditions,   where you do not show off, where you do not seek \na reputation that people name you Hajji Fulan as   in so many Muslim countries people are known with \nthis prefix before their names Hajji Assim, Hajji   Ahmed, what is this? This is the type of showing \noff that the Prophet ﷺ sought refuge in Allah   sallallahu alaihi wasallam and in an accepted \nHajj does not have intimacy or disobedience   or the likes, it has no arguments and \ndebates, and it is performed with Halal money,   so the intention of Hajj is to \nbe made for the sake of Allah. And this is why Allah commanded the Muslims   by saying, \"And complete the \nHajj and Umrah for Allah\" The Hajj and Umrah cannot be for   worldly matters, cannot be for people, it's \nonly for the sake of Allah the Almighty."
