  "title": "If Imam stands for the 5th rakat & we say SubhanAllah to notify him, but he continues, what to do",
  "transcript": "for art from Bangladesh so Sheikh my question is if the Imam mistakenly stands for the fifth record during the congregation prayer and we say subhanallah but he doesn't sit back down what should the person praying behind him do so a scenario the Imam is praying for raqqa prayers such as in the third raka after the second prostration he says instead of standing for the fourth he sits for the Third and everybody says subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah and he continues he's Relentless he doesn't want to listen he thinks that I'm doing the right thing or the Imam in the fourth raqqa after the second prostration says instead of sitting for that the final he stands up for the fifth tracker people say subhanallah subhanallah and he doesn't come down he thinks that I'm doing the right thing what to do in both cases some Scholars say has to wait until the Imam finishes and rectifies and some say that no the Imam has committed an act which is distorting the nature of the prayer so in the first scenario he has abandoned a whole pillar a whole unit and he's not listening to the people behind him what to do you guys stand up and continue your fourth raqqa and do your suju do your tashah and offer conclusion on your own each one on his own intend to depart and leave your Imam and in the second scenario when you stood up for the fifth raka you guys remain sitting do your tushahood and offer your Salam and leave the prayer or if you wish you can sit and wait until he finishes his Fifth raka and does his and offer salaam with him but I wouldn't do that personally I would just leave the prayer and law Knows Best foreign"
