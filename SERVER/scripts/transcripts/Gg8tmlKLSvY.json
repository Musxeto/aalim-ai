  "transcript": "according to your knowledge of the subject da what is the most important verse in the Quran which gives instructions about passing The Message of Islam to non-muslims as I mentioned earlier there are hundreds of verses in the Quran we speak about dawa many verses give the methodology but according to me the master key for doing dawa to the non-muslim is Surah al- Imran chapter number three verse number 64 which says say oh people of the book come to Common terms as us and you which is the first term Allah that we worship none but one Allah subhana tala that we associate no partners with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and patrons other than Allah if then they turn back say winess that we are Muslims bowing to Allah subhana tala this was of the Quran though it's addressed to theab it can be used for any non-muslim it says come to Comm in terms as us and you which is the first term that we worship none but Allah so the most important thing that we have to speak to the non-muslim is about for the concept of concept of oness of Allah subhana tala we can start the topic asking him that what does he feel is wrong with Islam and what things that interest him but your main focus should be you have to come to the main point of avoiding shik and believing in Allah subhana tala unless you don't come toed Your da will be useless you can start with other things scientific aspect and other things that interest him literature maybe history but unless you do not prove to him about the Oneness of Allah subhana tala Your da will be used this you have to prevent him from doing therefore I call this ver of the Quran as the master key for da otherwise there are many other verses including chapter number 16 verse number 125 he says invite all the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best most gracious so Allah subhana tells us that when you you have to do with hi and in ways that best most gracious"
