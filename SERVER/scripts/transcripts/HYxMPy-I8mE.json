  "transcript": "Okay, Sheikh. Thank you very much. But one point, Sheikh. You mentioned earlier that somebody to pay a taxation. It's called Jizya. Correct. Can you please tell us a bit, Sheikh, about this Jizya which implemented in the Islamic country? Jizya is a financial compensation not taken from children, not taken from women, and not taken from elderly who are unable to work. Yes. It's not also taken from priests. Okay. It's only taken from healthy, active, working men. Productive men. Correct. Okay. This is estimated roughly between one to four dinar, which is equivalent of, let's say, maybe, I don't know exactly, but maybe 10 to 15 grams of gold. I see. Which is not a thing at all. Mm-hmm. In return of what? Mm-hmm. In return that they live safely in our country or their country. And if there were an army to attack their country, they do not defend themselves. It's the Muslim army, the Muslim nation, the Muslim people who are obliged to protect them, and they don't even raise a hand. I see. So they don't need to go to war. No. Okay. So the country protects them. Correct. Okay. Because they pay the Jizya. Correct. And the Jizya is paid monthly or yearly? No, it's yearly. Yearly? Yes. Okay. It depends on the ruler. He can have it twice a year or once a year, depending on his ruling. Mm-hmm."
