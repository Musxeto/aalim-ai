  "transcript": "Faiz from Singapore Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, is it true that Sarah has been, was oppressing Hagar to the point that Hagar need to cover her tracks from Sarah? I don't understand your question Faiz There's a hadith that says that Hagar covered her tracks from Sarah or something because she was afraid of Sarah if I'm not mistaken I have no idea, I was not there at the time and I do not recall such a hadith where a Hajar, the mother of Ismail, was afraid from Sarah, the mother of Isaac or Ishaq, peace be upon them and to the extent that she used to cover her tracks, I don't know this fear of Hagar might be something personal, not due to any oppression or aggression from Sarah's part maybe this is what she felt and she hid her tracks because she was afraid, not because there was something bad being plotted or done by Sarah and either way the jealousy does exist between the co-wives and we know that so there is a possibility but it's not beneficial for us to go down that lane and discuss things we have no knowledge of providing that the hadith is authentic, I don't know, I have not looked into the hadith and Allah Azzawajal knows best"
