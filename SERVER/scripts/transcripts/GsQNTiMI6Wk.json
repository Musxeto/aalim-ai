  "transcript": "foreign [Music] back with us my question is unfortunately all the masjids in our residential area are controlled by the devendis and the nearest one is around 300 meters from home so it takes around three to four minutes to go there now as per um began at 607 pm today but the nearest Masjid gave the advance of Maghrib at 6 11 pm and they began the iqama in less than one and a half minutes after the end of the event that is at 6 15 PM so ultimately my question is am I obliged to break my fast upon hearing this event and then Prema krip in the congregation of this Masjid well actually this issue always reoccurs we have a problem says something and the Masjid adjacent to us says something else who should we follow basically speaking as an individual I'm obliged to pray and break my fast as soon as the sun sets however I cannot depend on the calendars because I'm not certain whether they're accurate or not my watch is accurate or not if I can see if I'm living at the seashore and I can see the sun setting once it disappears I can break my fast and pray Maghrib whether the Masjid adjacent to me gave that then or not I could care less but if I don't have any visual or certainty that the sun has set in this case I must rely and depend on the message next to me because they are the one who's taking responsibility on the day of judgment for calling the Adan I have no way of just yeah it says it's time no this is a concept and depending on the watch that might be mistaken or depending on the um calendar where there could be one or two minutes difference between some apps although they claim that they're following I'm not following omakura for certain then this is problematic I would highly advise you not to break your fast until you're certain that the sun has set either visually or by following the Masjid Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
