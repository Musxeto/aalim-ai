  "title": "Cannot take Friday ghusl due to waking up late | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question was about Friday prayers he wakes up late and after answering the call of nature he finds out that the hota the sermon has begun so now he's in a dilemma if he takes the Friday hold he will miss the full hopper and might miss the whole prayer as well so what to do the answer is next time try to wake up early go to bed early so that you wake up early secondly the ruling on Friday bath or ritual bath is an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that it's highly recommended it's a preferred Sunnah but it is not mandatory or a condition in the validity of your prayer so even if you don't do it then you are not sinful for that insha'Allah"
