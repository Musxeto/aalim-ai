  "transcript": "foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] which says we should actually supplicate when we are supplicating we need to repeat the supplication maybe Thrice or in odd numbers so is this authentic and should be always supplicate in odd numbers or three times liked and preferred as we mentioned this in on Thursday's episode in the things that the prophet loves he whenever he would make Dua he would make it Thrice and this is not a general statement meaning that every Dua I see for the prophet I would find that he would make it Thrice rather he would used to do he used to do this but occasionally so for us if you want Allah to forgive you as we when we conclude the Salat the Sunnah is to say the first thing is three times not like people saying Allahu Akbar in the subcontinent which is wrong a lot of the Muslims say the moment they say assalamu alaikum this is totally wrong and this is not backed up by a Hadith that the prophet used to say this Assam on the contrary the Hadith Muslim he said the first thing the prophet said after salaam is then Etc so making Dua Thrice is a good thing but it is not mandatory if you want to do it that's good for you the more you insist upon Allah the closer it is for you to get your Dua answered [Music] oh foreign have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
