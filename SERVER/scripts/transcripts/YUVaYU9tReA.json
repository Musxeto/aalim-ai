  "transcript": "My second question is that which is a preferred way of doing the tasbih? Should we do it on the prayer beads or on the fingertips of both the hands or on the fingertips of only the right hand? The sunnah is to do it only on the right hand. The Prophet ï·º recommended doing tasbih on your fingertips and said that they will talk on the day of judgment to testify. So this is only to do on the right hand. If someone does it on both hands, this is permissible but it's not part of the sunnah. So the sunnah is to say SubhanAllah, SubhanAllah, SubhanAllah, SubhanAllah, SubhanAllah. You can hold this to count that I've just done a set of five. And another one and this. This is not tasbih. The tasbih is done on the right and this one is just to keep the score. If you don't want to do neither and you want to use the prayer beads, this is also permissible but it is not as rewarding. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
