  "title": "Can a woman be a teacher for boys who are almost men if she abides by proper hijab?",
  "transcript": "label's second question was can a woman teach grown-ups boys and girls in high school or in college if she's abiding by the hijab and the answer is no she is not permitted to teach grown-up boys or other in other terms men even if she's abiding by the hijab because this that is mixing with them teaching them explaining to them addressing them being with them defies the purpose of hijab so many women think that hijab is simply covering your body and the vast majority of muslims i've seen that when i travel in different countries they think that hijab is only covering their hair you might find a woman wearing a t-shirt with her arms exposed showing her body and with jeans but she's covering her hair with hijab and she considers herself to be hijabi this is not hijab some of them even come on and participate in shows like um this have talents or or so you think you can dance or whatever and you find them in american idols and etc waiting to hijab and they come and sing and dance and flirt and do things that no muslim in his right mind would do and all of this is unislamic so what is happening this is when you have dr jekyll mr hyde personality so they think that practicing islam is an identity card that says muslim you find bollywood actors considering themselves to be muslims and they have nothing related to islam when they marry hindu women and this is totally prohibited in islam not a single muslim would say it's halal and they have shrines in their homes and they prostrate to that and they say i give my children the freedom to be hindus or christians or atheists or agnostic no muslim would say this but these guys are muslims by identity it says in the passport religion islam are they true muslims no they're not because they're not walking the talk and they have they are doing lots of thing that takes them out of the fold of islam so coming back to the question it defies the purpose of hijab to mix with men to speak with them freely and to normalize relationships and socialize with them hijab is not just the cover of the body it's one aspect of it but also we must we the women are addressed in the quran not to soften their voices so that people with sick hearts would not be tempted and lured by their voices they're not allowed to wear anklets in their feet that has a sound so that when they walk men would not find it attractive they're not allowed to wear perfumes and if they do and non-mahra men find the smell it's a major sin and the list goes on why because islam protects both men and women from one another and this is why we have to have full segregation and there is no compromise none whatsoever"
