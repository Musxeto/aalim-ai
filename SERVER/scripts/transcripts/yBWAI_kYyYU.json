  "transcript": "okay muhammad for him from the philippines he's referring to the hadith of the prophet and the prophet explained what this means everyone in my ummah will be forgiven except those who boast about it and part of boasting about it the prophet says allah is when you commit a sin in secrecy and nobody knows about it so it's daytime it's morning and allah has concealed your sin nobody knows about it then you go to your friend and say hey listen yesterday i did this and this so you expose what allah has concealed the prophet says islam this allah will not forgive and then muhammad says so does this mean that allah does not forgive shirk etc no no you have to understand the hadith in line with other evidences and this is the way of sunnah al-jamara the way of the people of innovation of is that they come to one single ayah or a particular hadith and they build their innovation according to that particular hadith though there are number of evidences other than that explaining governing and controlling the meaning of that particular hadith or particular ayah but they don't want to see that so they come to a single ayah who committed sin and the sin surrounds them they will abide in hell fire for eternity so they said okay this is exactly what we say people you're not listening whoever commits a major sin he's a kafir and he's in hell forever where did you get this from the eye is crystal clear yeah but there are different ayahs and there are different hadiths that prove that if a person does not commit shirk all other sins are accordance to all to the divine will no no we don't want to listen to this if a person repents before he dies allah forgives him even if he commits shirk we don't want to listen to this we have this idea anyone any muslim committing a major sin he's a catholic and we can kill him and we can abduct his family and enslave them and take his money and wealth okay this you guys have a uh um and and a personal vendetta an agenda that you want to fulfill and this is not islam so any sin that a person commits whether he boasts about it or is in private whether it's shirk kufur disbelief any horrible thing once a person repents quits that sin has remorse and comes asking for forgiveness allah would definitely forgive him"
