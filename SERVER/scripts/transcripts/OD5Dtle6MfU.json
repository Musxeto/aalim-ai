  "title": "What must a follower recite behind an imam (Fatiha behind an imam) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says what are the things that a follower must recite while praying behind any ma'am I'm confused as some people say we must not recite anything behind the mmm not even the takbirs is this true well instead of giving you a fish every day it's best that I teach you how to fish yourself so that you don't need me anymore and this is what every diary and scholar does in their lectures it's very easy to say yes no and move on but rather they insist on teaching you to learn where they learnt from so instead of coming back to me and asking me the same question over and over I'll teach you how to fish first of all those who say a follower must not say anything behind the mm not even the takbir this is ridiculous nowhere in the Quran are in the Sunnah that it restricts you from saying anything rather the opposite in the core in the Sunnah it teaches us how to pray behind any map and the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was salam in the majority Mammalia 10 maybe verily that the imam was made so that people would follow him for either cup barovik a bureau so if he says allahu akbar say Allahu Akbar so brother whoever told you that not to say the takbir is definitely a big time ignorant he doesn't know the sunnah and you cannot learn from such people even if they have long and big beards and we're big turbans on their heads this is not a qualification to teach people those who teach people must be knowledgeable of the Quran and if the Sunnah if you're a Muslim but to be a blind follower of a meth hub or a school of thought or a mess lack as they say an ignore totally the Quran and Sunnah houston we have a problem so the Prophet said a Salaam and if he says Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah you say rob Menelik al hamd you have to reply in say Eric Bana Allah can hampt and the Prophet also ordered the Muslims to recite the Fatiha only behind the imam when he prays in loud prayers and this is why it's an issue of dispute among scholars whether a follower must recite the fatiha or must remain silent so we all agree that a person praying alone an individual an imam must recite the fatiha in every rakah so an imam and an individual they have to recite the fat hen every rakah because this is a pillar the remaining would be a follower so you're either in Imam or an individual praying alone or a follower of an imam as for the followers of Imam the scholars have disputed in regards of fatiha some and this is led by Abu Hanifah may Allah have mercy on his soul and those who follow him say that it is not permissible to recite the fatiha in any raka will you praying behind the mm whether it's a loud raka or a silent raka so what should I do just stand there and watch the stars and count them they said yes you don't say anything other scholars led by an imam al Buhari may Allah have mercy on his soul say that you must as a follower recite the fatiha regardless of the type of raka whether it's silent or loud a third group took a middle path after collecting all the evidences and analyzing them and this is the opinion of Imam Ali Khamenei Ana's may Allah have mercy on his soul - Imam of Medina he said that in silent raka the mom the follower is obliged to recite the fatiha and Eve in every single rocker that is silent because he did not hear it from the Imam so he has to recite it for himself and if there is enough time he should recite another surah no problem but when the raka is loud and the imam is reciting in a loud voice Jihan the fatiha then his recitation is sufficient for me I'm not obliged to recite it so if I skip it no problem what about if I want to recite it go ahead recite it can I recite another surah afterwards it is totally prohibited to recite in loud Rakas anything else other than the fatiha for the follower of course the Imam is gonna recite the fatiha afterwards Ashura for you the follower if you wish you can recite the fatiha once he's finished with his own fatiha but you may not at all recite anything other than the fatiha because the Prophet as I'm prohibited that so I hope this answers your question"
