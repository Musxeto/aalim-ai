  "transcript": "Inna Alhamdulillah Nahmaduhu Wa Nastaeenuhu Wa Nastaghfiruhu Wa Na'udhu Billahi Min Shururi Anfusina Wa Min Sayyiati A'malina Man Yahdihi Allahu Fala Mudhillalah Wa Man Yudhill Fala Hadiyalah Wa Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah Wahdahu La Sharikalah Wa Ashhadu Anna Muhammadan Abduhu Wa Rasuluh O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and you will die except as Muslims. O you people! Fear your Lord, Who created you from one soul, and created from it its mate, and spread among them many men and women. And fear Allah, about whom you ask, and the most Merciful. Indeed, Allah is ever watching over you. O you who believe! Fear Allah and speak a just word. He will amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly attained a great success. As for the next, the most truthful hadith is the words of Allah and the best guidance. The guidance of our Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. And the worst of things are their innovations. And every innovation is a creation. And every creation is a misguidance. And every misguidance is in the Fire. Ibadallah! Allah the Almighty has created man in nature by the man being weak. We cannot stand alone. And we need one another. As individuals, we need others to collaborate and to cooperate with us. That's why we need others to plough the earth, to sow the seeds, to harvest the crops. We need people to manufacture the machines and to make products, to market them. We need others to buy them. So we do need one another because life does not go on without such cooperation. We cannot stand alone. And this is in worldly matters. However, even in religion, even when it comes to Sharia, the same concept is applied. We need one another to implement the Sharia and to enforce this religion. Even the Prophets and Messengers, peace and blessings of Allah be upon them, needed the support of their loyal companions. Allah Azza wa Jal says, And how many a Prophet fought in battle, and with him fought many religious scholars and companions, but they never lost assurance due to what afflicted them in the cause of Allah, nor did they weaken or submit, and Allah loves the steadfast. Say Ameen. May Allah Azza wa Jal make me and you among those who are steadfast. So the Prophets and the Messengers needed their loyal companions to spread Tawheed and to defeat Shirk. And likewise, Muslims need one another in their worldly affairs as well as in their Islamic affairs. And that is why cooperation and collaboration among the Muslims is a very important issue. It was mandated and obligated upon us by Allah Azza wa Jal. And our affairs could never go and progress, could never go forward, nor progress without such cooperation. When we have one word, when we have one stand, when we have solidarity, this is the only time when our enemies would fear us. And look around you. Does the enemy fear the Muslims? No, by Allah. We're so distracted, disunited, we're so conflicted among one another, even in the Masjid you would find worshippers fighting with one another. Where is the unity? Where is the solidarity? Where is the cooperation? Allah Azza wa Jal says in the Qur'an, وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. Al-Imam At-Tabari Ibn Jarir, may Allah have mercy on his soul, says in his Tafsir about this ayah, this is an address to the believers that each individual must cooperate with one another on Al-Bir, righteousness, which is everything that Allah ordered you to do. And on Taqwa, which is piety, and that is to stay away from everything that Allah prohibited you from approaching or doing. And when we want to list righteousness and piety, Al-Bir and Taqwa, when we want to list it, we find that the list is almost endless. So, as an example, cooperating on Jihad, if the Muslims collaborated and cooperated and joined forces on Jihad, none of our territory would be occupied. None of our Muslim brothers and sisters anywhere in the world would be oppressed. But it's unfortunate when the Muslims themselves assist the disbelievers in oppressing our Muslim brothers and sisters. We need cooperation in stopping the aggression, in avenging those who are oppressed, in returning the rights to their lawful owners. We need cooperation to reconcile between the fighting factions, to teach the ignorant and to provide authentic knowledge. We need to cooperate in helping the destitute, the poor, the needy, the relatives, the orphans, the widows, those who are in need. We need to cooperate among ourselves to pay the debts of those who are in debt. And among that, even giving gifts, lending things that are not needed by you to others so that they could use it. Among the forms of collaboration and cooperation is to answer the invitation when invited, is to give food to those who are hungry, is to give iftar to those who are fasting, is to follow a deceased Muslim to his grave and to offer the funeral prayers, is to assist someone who's in need to get married financially, is to give nasiha and advice to whomever is seeking it from you. And in short, to collaborate and cooperate upon righteousness and piety includes everything that Allah Azza wa Jal loves and wants you to do, whether it is part of His own rights Azza wa Jal or part of the rights of other humans. This bond between the Muslims, if it existed, this gives them power, this gives them authority, and it throws the fear in the hearts of their enemies. And this is what the Prophet ﷺ based the majority of his da'wah in Medina upon. So when the migrants of Medina came and they met the people, the locals of Medina, the Ansar, the migrants were poor, they left their wealth, their families, everything they owned, and came fleeing the lands of kufr with their own iman and religion. To compensate them, the Prophet ﷺ enforced cooperation upon righteousness and piety among the Muslims. So he allocated each muhajir, immigrant, to one of the Ansar of the locals of Medina. And he not only did that, he made them brothers in Islam, to the extent that if one of them were to die, the other would inherit him. So Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, may Allah be pleased with him, one of the ten heaven bound, who came poor, had nothing, was allocated to Sa'd ibn al-Rabi'ah. May Allah be pleased with him. And the moment the Prophet said, he's your brother, take care of him. Sa'd ibn al-Rabi'ah went to Abd al-Rahman and said, Abd al-Rahman, the people of Medina know that I am the richest among them all. And I have two wives that are righteous and kind. Because the Prophet made you my brother, half of my wealth is yours. And I will divorce one of my wives, of course after consulting her, and after she is out of the iddah, you can marry her. What kind of humans are these? What kind of a man is he? I would understand if he were to share a thousand, ten thousand of his wealth. But to show such transparency and say, half of what I have is yours? This is crazy. What's more crazy is that Abd al-Rahman is saying, Whoa, who hates freebies? I'm on. Instead, he said, بارك الله لك في مالك وأهلك. May Allah put barakah in your wealth and in your family. Just show me where the market is. That's it. He did not take anything. What kind of pride this man had in Iman. He would not even cross the line, though it was willingly given to him. This compassion, this collaboration, this brotherhood is what took them all over the world to spread Islam. And this is how Islam was spread from east to west. Not by the sword, only. It was spread by the sword, by the word, and by this compassion and mercy and love. The Prophet ﷺ says, The believers in their mutual kindness, compassion, and sympathy are just like one body. When one of the limbs suffers, the whole body responds to it with lack of sleep and fever. أقول هذا القول وأستغفر الله لي ولكم فاستغفروه إنه هو الغفور الرحيم الحمد لله رب العالمين وأشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له وأشهد أن محمد عبده ورسوله صلى الله عليه وآله وصحبه أجمعين Cooperation and collaboration and unity among the Muslims is a clear form of mercy that Allah bestows upon them. Whenever you see a community, a society that has this in them, then acknowledge that Allah عز و جل loves them and puts mercy in their hearts. And whenever there is discord, disunity, fighting, then this is a sign of Allah's torment and punishment upon them. The Prophet ﷺ says, Allah, the compassionate one, has mercy on those who are merciful. If you show mercy to those who are on the earth, He who is in the heaven will show mercy to you. الرَّحِمُونَ يَرْحَمُهُمُ اللَّهُ This mercy has different shades and forms, but it all revolves around cooperation in righteousness and piety. So if a sick man, if someone who's ill and you visit them, and you give them words of encouragement and treatment, this is mercy. If you find someone who's hungry and starving and you give them food, you've shown them mercy. If you see someone who's been captive, whether unlawfully or lawfully, whether in debt or for any other reason, and you intercede and you help financially to set him free, you have expressed and showed him mercy. And likewise, if you go to an orphanage, or you meet an orphan and you just wipe over their head, this is a kind and a gesture of mercy that Allah Azza wa Jal would definitely have mercy upon you. And this is why the Prophet says, in a beautiful hadith, showing and highlighting the beauty of cooperation upon piety and righteousness, the Prophet says, The most beloved of people to Allah is the one who brings most benefit to people. And the most beloved of deeds to Allah is making a Muslim happy, or relieving him of hardship, or paying off his debt, or warding off hunger from him. The Prophet goes on to say, For me, to go with my Muslim brother to meet his needs is dearer to me than observing i'tikaf in this mosque, the mosque of Medina, for a whole month. To go with your brother and help him in achieving his needs is more beloved to the Prophet ﷺ than to do seclusion and i'tikaf in his own masjid in Medina for a whole month. So this is the most beloved person to Allah Azza wa Jal. He's the person whom Allah assigned him to help people achieve their needs. He helps people by his advice, by his knowledge, by his financial assistance, by his authority and by his reputation, by interceding when this is needed. He does this only for the sake of Allah Azza wa Jal, not asking for praise or compliment from anyone. And the Prophet ﷺ stated that to execute and to fulfill my brother's desire is dearer to myself than to stay in my masjid, in ibadah, in seclusion for a whole month. And the Prophet walked the talk ﷺ. His whole life is a manifestation of this, helping people. Even the young girl who had mental issues, as the hadith says, comes to him and says, I have something to talk to you about. Set an appointment for me. And he sets an appointment for her. And she comes, she holds his hand and he walks with her in the streets of Medina, listening to her problem. Young girl who is mentally challenged, yet the Prophet ﷺ finds the time to listen to her. Hakeem ibn Hizam, may Allah be pleased with him, the nephew of Khadijah ibn Tughwailid, may Allah be pleased with her, says, any day I wake up in the morning and I don't see people asking me to help them outside my door, I feel that this is a calamity from Allah and a punishment. Subhanallah. He sees that when no one is asking him for help, financially or physically, no one is standing outside his door, waiting for him to come out and say, please I need this, I need this help, I need to borrow, I need you to help me and speak to my landlord. If he doesn't see anyone asking of him, he says, this is a calamity and a punishment from Allah Azza wa Jal that I seek the reward from Allah. Ibadallah. O servants of Allah. Brothers and sisters. Among us, there are people who are well known. They are celebrities. Because everyone talks about them in their gatherings. That individual, mashallah, tabarakallah. He always helps people. He always gives without asking. He always assists when people need assistance. And they keep on praising and appreciating and showing their gratitude to such people because they know they spend their health and wealth to help others and cooperate with them on righteousness and piety. And if they could not help, the least they could do is give you a good smile and give you a good dua. Therefore, try your level best, dear brother and sister. Try your level best to leave a good mark. To leave a fingerprint. To leave a good legacy. What is your legacy when you die tomorrow? What will people remember you of? Because these people are the witnesses of Allah on earth. Imagine, when one of us dies, if people say, may Allah have mercy on him. He was a righteous person. He was a good man. He used to give in charity. He used to teach the ignorant. He used to help us. This testimony would be accepted by Allah. And if one of us was cursed by the people, may Allah curse him. He always caused problems and fitna among the Muslims. He always blocked good things from reaching others. He always caused enmity and malice in the Muslims' hearts. Allah Azza wa Jal would accept their curse and would curse that individual. So, do your level best to cooperate and to collaborate with the Muslims upon righteousness and virtue and upon piety so that Allah Azza wa Jal may have mercy upon us all. O Allah, do not make this world a greater burden for us, nor the extent of our knowledge, nor to Hell is our destination. O Allah, help our Mujahideen, who are striving for Your cause everywhere. O Allah, establish the flag of Jihad, suppress the people of polytheism and corruption, and destroy the enemies of this religion. You are the Almighty, the Wise. Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions."
