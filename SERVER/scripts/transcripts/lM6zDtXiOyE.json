  "title": "Who is a Mahram to me in my in-laws through Marriage?",
  "transcript": "Musbah? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Sheikh I wanted to know that since my father and my mother are mehram to my wife, are her parents mehram to me? I mean can her mother not cover herself in front of me? This is totally beside the point. Now you are mehram to your wife, does this make you a mehram to her sister? Yes or no Musbah? No. So how would your siblings or how would your wife's aunts and relatives become mehram to you? The only mehrams to you are those related to your wife, meaning your wife's mother is your mehram. Of course her father is a male so he's not a mehram. Your wife's grandmother is a mehram to you because she bears the name of your wife's mother, though she's her grandmother, but she's actually her mother as well, whether paternal or maternal. They are your mehram because they are the mother of your wife, the mother-in-law. So your mother-in-law, her mother, her grandmother, all of them are mehram the same from her father's side and I hope this answers your question. you"
