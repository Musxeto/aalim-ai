  "title": "Can we participate or play games with prizes Gifts can vary from cheap to expensive? | aah",
  "transcript": "halima says can we participate games that have the top three places receive prizes but we don't know what we will get until we win it and games where you pick a random box out of a few boxes and you get whatever is in it the gifts in the boxes can vary from very expensive to rare or rare to cheap from one box to the other but no money or any sort of giving is involved you get you keep free and nothing more I don't know of such a game but it seems to me that this game is done within the family because it's not logical to have a public game as such and giving gifts away for no reason if this is on telly on the TV then this must include women music and many other Haram things so participating and it is totally prohibited end of story but if it's something between friends and I'm a rich man and I'm I'm spending my time and money to make my friends happy and I do this for them and they choose one gets a Rolex and another one gets a bottle top or an empty bottle or whatever this is okay providing there's no Haram involved providing the participants did not invest or pay a single dime nor to participate as a subscription nor as a payment for the app to be downloaded in this case this seems to be okay in sha allah azza wajal"
