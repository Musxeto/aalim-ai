  "title": "He uses a wheelchair, does the hadith apply to him of the wearing pants ABOVE the ankles?",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from the usum okay so uh my question is I use a wheelchair and you said that um people who put their um their clothes below the ankle like that's that's Haram but since I can't wear shoes is that okay or does that apply to me also we said this earlier that if a person wears his trousers especially in cold places and the trousers go and cover his whole leg including the ankles but he takes his socks and wears them so that it covers the trousers and the ankles so no one can see that it is exceeding the ankles in this case it's Halal inshallah likewise if you're wearing boots so if you're wearing boots that cover your part of your leg including the ankles and no one could see that there's no problem in that the problem is when you're not wearing normal shoes the ankles are uh visible and your trousers fall and cover your ankles this is Haram and not permissible"
