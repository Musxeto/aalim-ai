  "transcript": "Aziz from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I want to say something before asking question. I don't take much time I'm sick from last two years and my condition is getting worse. Alhamdulillah, but Sheikh I am starting HIFS. Alhamdulillah, and also I am learning Arabic language. So can you make dua for me in Tahajjud? Wallahi In Sha Allah, I will put you in the long list I have. May Allah Azza Wa Jal protect you and save you and cure you and make you healthier and better than before What's your question? My question is about Wasilah We can ask with the Wasilah of Allah's names like Ya Razzaq, with the Wasilah of your name Al-Razzaq, give me rizq But some names are not related to certain things like Al-Hayyu, the ever-living. It can't be connected to any desire So can we ask just anything any random thing with the name With this name like give me good grades with the Wasilah of your name Al-Hayyu. The name Al-Hayyu Incubates most of the beautiful names of Allah Azza Wa Jal and this is why a huge amount of scholars, a great amount of scholars Consider Al-Hayyu Al-Qayyum to be the greatest name of Allah Where the Prophet said Alayhi Salatu Salam Ism Allah Al-A'adham The greatest name of Allah if he were to be called by he would respond and answer is Al-Hayyu Al-Qayyum A lot of scholars say that this is the actual the greatest name of Allah Azza Wa Jal because Al-Hayyu and Al-Qayyum incubates most of Allah's beautiful names underneath. So Al-Hayyu has to be knowledgeable has to be wise has to be strong has to be capable has to be The one who provides and Al-Qayyum is also the one who sustains the lives of every Creature on this in this universe and the likes. So yes, you can ask Allah with this beautiful name Al-Hayyu"
