  "title": "Is it true that if you enter Mecca, you HAVE to perform Umrah whether you have the intention or not?",
  "transcript": "Fahiz from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wassalamu Alaikum. So there's this incident where I was still living in Saudi Arabia and we decided to visit Taif and at the same time you know Mecca was nearby so we decided to visit our relative, decided to visit them. So when we talked to them they mentioned that when we have, when we enter Mecca whether we have the intention or not that we are supposed to perform the Umrah and secondly even if we are coming from Jeddah because there is no Miqat so we in that case we are not obliged to do it and secondly that I think they mentioned at Hudud Haram that once we enter that area like we are it's mandatory for Muslims to perform the the state of ihram and what they say is baseless when the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and the companions went to mecca on the fath of mecca the conquest of mecca none of them was wearing ihram so what they're saying is totally bogus"
