  "transcript": "baji bombastic again this is a question that came on the YouTube a few minutes back baji bombastic if someone earns Haram income is the nikah valid if they know about it or they don't know about it if they know but earn due to helplessness baji bombastic has asked a question that if they earn something Haram is the ncah valid now the both these things that if the nah as the Shar the nah is valid your income has nothing to do with the nah I already give an example suppose I Rob water robbing water is Haram with that water which I have robbed I do wo and I offer my Salah is my Salah valid of course my Salah is valid because for the Salah to be valid I have to do woo so if I did woo with water my Salah is valid but robbing is Haram will my Salah be accepted Salah is accepted but the act of robbing I'll get punishment for that so similarly if you have earned something Haram then you will get the punishment for that you'll get the sin for that but that doesn't mean your nikah is Haram as long as you followed the and you followed the Shar while doing the nikah if all the principles of Shar you followed while doing the nikah you have given the May and you've seen to it that you CH the right partner Etc nah is valid it has nothing to do with your income but of course if you're doing something Haram you see to it that you stop the Haram you ask Allah for forgiveness you repent to Allah stop it don't do it again then you will have a happy islamically aligned married life so if you're earning Haram and if you have done nikah of course you'll continue earning that Haram so my advice to you would be stop it first you alone now you have your wife and you only need something even if you earn something less no problem earning Halal lesser amount is better than earning Haram or bigger amount because it will not benefit you in this world or the hope that answer question"
