  "title": "I'm studying Economics; if I become a Teacher, I may have to teach about interest,  halal or haram?",
  "transcript": "scott from germany he says i'm studying i'm studying economics and i might be a phd student who know who knows if i were to become a teacher in a university i may have to teach my students courses about interest compound how to calculate how to uh audit how to do these things so is this halal it's part of a syllabus it's part of the big curriculum of teaching economics which is not all haram but this topic has to be studied so that the students would know how things are run not necessarily that they will practice it of course if you're doing your due diligence and at the same time warning them about the capital system and the interest-based loans and what it did to the world in 2008 and the credit crunch etc that would be excellent"
