  "transcript": "um we have Muhammad from Pakistan good question I I married in I need to give you a quick uh a background of my situation so you can have a better idea and to understand my situation as well like I married in 2015 in Australia and I have two kids alhamdulillah and I took really I was a I took responsibility as a husband and father including caring of my four step children as well but um something happened I wasn't on permanent Visa so I had to return back to my home country which is Pakistan in 2018 and I was since our relationship really has suffered a lot I mean we are at the point where we are no longer communicating with each other she has a point because I'm no longer providing from my family anymore although I'm trying hard I'm educating myself to upskill myself so I can able to earn in dollars not in my local currency to help my family but I think it's too late now so to the point I need your guidance like because she really wants to move on now and I really don't want her to take any step which is against which goes against Allah um unusual guidance what type of diverse it will be is it is it considered to be hola or me granting her the diverse and okay basically speaking due to the fact that you're unable to provide for her and for her children this is a deficiency in you and hence you have to give her divorce if she's asking for it because it's your fault for not providing for her and for her children she's not obliged to file for holler and give you back the Dowry because there's no fault from her side she waited patiently from 2018 or whatever until date and you have not managed to change any things so you should give her a divorce and if you refuse to do this you'll be sinful yet she can still go to the Islamic Center and file for annulment of the marriage due to her absence and failure to provide for her and the Muslim judge can do that and Allah Knows Best foreign"
