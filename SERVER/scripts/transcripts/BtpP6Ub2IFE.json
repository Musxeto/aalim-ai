  "title": "Should I wash the hair by the ears in Wudu",
  "transcript": "Sumeyya from the UK. So my question is when I make wudu I have some hair in front of my ear that connects to the main hair on my head and it's not a sideburn that connects to a beard it's just it comes like in front of my ear like half of my ear so I wanted to know can I am I supposed to wash this hair because sometimes it can get difficult to ensure that water just you know scheme okay Sumeyya Islam is a religion of ease which means that such hardship you're facing is not from Islam it is from Shaitaan most likely trying to mess up with you you get water in your hands your face is whatever faces the people this is not my face because it's not facing the people so this is your face there is no pen drawing the borders your face you get the water you wash your face that's it once is enough oh Sheikh there is some hair here I don't know I do I need to get a magnifying glass or should I call people to investigate whether it's dry or wet no need this is extreme Islam is a religion of peace this is how much the Prophet used to make wudu with what you're talking about is two three gallons in order to just make sure that every single spot is thoroughly washed and I'm having doubts this is not from Islam get over it and move on inshallah"
