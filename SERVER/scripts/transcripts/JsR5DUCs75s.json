  "transcript": "Anna from Uganda So after a while I decided to stop the prayers, so did I do the right thing? No you did not do the right thing. If this is your menses, you have to stop prayer. But if it's not, if it's in the beginning of your menses and it's just spotting, in this case you do not stop praying until the flow of the blood starts. Now if you come and say to me, I don't have the flow of blood ever, all what I get is these spotting for seven days or eight days every month, in this case you treat this as your menses. But someone who has the spottings, then the flow of blood, then spottings, they have to consider the spottings in the beginning and disregard it, not to be from their menses, but to clean themselves and perform wudu for every prayer. Once the bleeding starts, this is their menses, and once the bleeding stops and the spotting begins, again this is part of their menses until they see the sign of purity and Allah Azzawajal knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everyone. So if you're not able to afford it, you can apply for one free session. And if you're not able to afford it, you can apply for one free session. And if you're not able to afford it, you can apply for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
