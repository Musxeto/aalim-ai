  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam. Sheikh can you demonstrate how and until where we need to wipe the head in wipe the head during During what? During Wudu. During Wudu okay so this is an issue of dispute because schools of thought differ some of them say you need to wipe the vast majority of it half of it quarter of it and they have their reasons and evidences because the ayah says in surah al ma'idah chapter 5 that we have to wipe over not to wash so wiping as prescribed in the hadith in the sunnah the prophet took both hands put it on his hair his head went to the back and forward that's it now he did not check with each and every strand was touched because it's swiping it's not washing so simply with wet hands my hands are wet I just do this and come back and I don't have to do this and start to rub and shampoo my head this is not from the sunnah at all and this is too extreme those who have OCD the more you make things difficult in life as if you're challenging Allah Azza wa Jal Allah will make things more difficult for you and he will torment you with this so keep it simple and easy do exactly what the prophet did and don't overthink and inshallah things would be fine you"
