  "transcript": "Taiba from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Jazak Allah for taking my call. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. I have one question that recently my son passed away and some people think that jinn possessed with him that's the reason he made a suicide. So my question to you is that is this possibility that jadu or killed jinn possessed they suicide by themself? First of all, I would like to say that I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. I am not a jadu. They're not known to be knowledgeable. They're not known to be scholars of Islam. They're not known to be physicians or doctors or scientists. Most likely they don't even know how to do things on their own. So all what they're doing is filling your heart with despair, making you more depressed and sad, as if it's not enough that your own beloved son committed suicide. This by itself is a crisis, is a calamity, is something that breaks anyone's heart, let alone a mother. Secondly, what is done is done. And what's in the past remains in the past. Nothing on earth we could do that it would reverse it. The only thing that we have control of is to depend, rely and have total confidence in Allah's mercy and forgiveness. This is the only thing that you can hang on and clinch to. So keep on asking Allah for forgiveness. Keep on asking Allah to have mercy on your son and trust that Allah is the most forgiving, most merciful. Whatever caused your son to commit suicide, whether it was jinn possession, black magic, mental illness or mere weakness, it is to Allah the most merciful to deal with it. So leave it with someone you trust that is more merciful to your son than you to your own flesh and blood. And may Allah grant him rahmah and forgiveness."
