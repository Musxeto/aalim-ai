  "transcript": "Ilyas from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? I'm doing great with the grace of Allah Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah. Sheikh my question is what is the etiquette and ways of a student of knowledge? How should a talib ul ilm be in his life? Akhi, are you serious with such questions? This requires a whole lecture. Not only that, it cannot be even contained in a lecture. A talib ul ilm, a scholar, a da'i or a normal Muslim, they are required by Islam to be real Muslims. Meaning that they submit their will to Allah. They walk the talk. They act to the letter according to the Quran and to the Sunnah. They avoid all haram. And they purify their attitude, their etiquette, the way they behave with others. So that it would fit the profile of a good Muslim. And this is in a nutshell. So it's not only words, words, words. No, you audit your life in accordance to the Quran, the Sunnah, in the understanding of the favourite three generations. And you would always align the way you live, the way you deal with people, with how our Prophet ﷺ used to deal with others. And one of the best books that I always ask people to purchase and read, they can also download it for free, alhamdulillah, is called How He Treated Them. How the Prophet ﷺ treated all segments of the society. It's a beautiful contemporary study of the behaviour of the Prophet ﷺ from the seerah. And this would open our eyes to the many shortcomings and flaws we have in our own lives. And Allah Azzawajal knows best."
