  "transcript": "the third rakah and then he became silent. At the end of the prayer he did Sujood As Sahoo differently. They say the Tashahud, then they say Salaam on the right side only and then give two prostrations then they again say Tashahud, Dhurud and then Taslim. So at that time I knew that this is not the correct method and also that we are not supposed to do Sujood As Sahoo for omitting a Sunnah but I still followed the Imam because I was confused. After the Imam concluded the prayer I gave two prostrations and offered Taslim individually. Is my prayer valid? Your prayer is valid but you were wrong in offering two Sujood As Sahoo on your own. You should have concluded the prayer with the Imam. Yes, the format which the Imam does in the Hanafi school of thought for forgetfulness is totally against the Sunnah of the Prophet It's not part of the Sunnah. The Prophet had never done such a thing. But because it's a reputable school of thought, we follow the Imam in whatever he does and we offer Salaam and move on. You don't add anything afterwards on your own."
