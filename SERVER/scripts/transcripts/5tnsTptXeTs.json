  "transcript": "and brother Muhammad from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh So I have a problem regarding my Iman. Whenever I study religion and I try to make myself believe in my heart in Allah, I don't feel the evidence makes me sure 100% and I know that this is kufr so it concerns me a lot. I know it's not waswasa because it doesn't come and go away, it's always there. So I want advice on what I should do. Basically speaking Akhi, when people come with such a problem and they claim they have no certainty, they have doubts, they have this and they emphasize the fact that it's not waswasa. I tell them okay, so you tell me how do you label and classify yourself? It's either you're a Muslim or you're a kafir. And then they start to think and 20 minutes later they come and say, well I don't know Shaykh, I'm confused, I'm this, I'm that. What are the consequences? What about my marriage? What about my inheritance? If I die, if my father dies, will I inherit? Why go to details Akhi? Are you a Muslim? Do you believe in Allah's existence? In Allah's oneness? In Allah's rububiyah, lordship, worship and in his beautiful names and attributes? I said yes. Do you believe in the five pillars of Islam? Do you pray? Do you fast? Do you offer zakat? I said yes. Do you believe in the six pillars of Iman? Do you believe in Allah azza wa jalla, the day of judgment, the angels, the scriptures, the prophets and the divine decree? I said yes, I believe. But I said Akhi, stop here. Why go into details? As long as you believe, then you're a Muslim. You work hard on improving your Islam, improving your Iman, improving your conviction, while being positive, while being a believer unconditionally, without any strings attached, without what if, but if I do this, but I don't do that. This is how Shaytan is messing up with you and with your head. Now, either you do this, or you simply say, I'm not a Muslim and quit Islam. Audhu billah, and go to hell for eternity. Nobody would do this in his right mind. You are the one who's opening the door and inviting Satan to come and mess up with your head."
