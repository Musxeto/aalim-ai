  "transcript": "Yusuf from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is how would I know if Allah loves me and is pleased with me and he has accepted my duas and so on that he will not punish me in the hereafter? How can I be certain of this? You can't. Simple as that. Last week I did a lecture in the province of Perlis in Malaysia and this is one of the furthest provinces to the north of Malaysia. A very nice place to be in, to retire in. Very nice people and community upon Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah Aqeedah and they are proud of it. And I did a lecture by the name of The Balance Between Fear and Love of Allah and it's on my YouTube channel. Watch that. The beauty of it is that we live our life balancing like a bird's wings between the fear of Allah and the hope in Allah. So these wings must be synchronized and balanced because if one overwhelms the other or overpowers the other the bird will fall and they have to be balanced. So when you are certain that Allah has forgiven my sins and accepted my dua and he loves me, I always get the notion of shaitan whispering in my ears and say, tell you what, why don't you watch a movie, listen to a song, visit the pub, go to a nightclub. This is sinful. Yeah but you have credit. Allah loves you. Allah accepted your dua. You have credit. And this is how shaitan drags our feet to hellfire. You have to have this fear. Maybe Allah did not accept my dua, what should I do? Make more dua. Maybe Allah did not accept my salah, what should I do? Offer more voluntary prayers. Give in charity. Continue to fear that Allah did not accept so you are positive in doing good deeds and hopeful that Allah will accept it until you die. And then after your death you will see that you have mountains and mountains of good deeds and that Allah loves you and that Allah has accepted your dua. But while you're alive be careful of shaitan dragging your feet telling you, you have got credit. You're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
