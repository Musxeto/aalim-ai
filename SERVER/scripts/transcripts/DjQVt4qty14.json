  "title": "Keeping relations with relatives who do not pray? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hassan says what's the ruling on keeping relation with relatives who do not pray first of all this question has a number of angles that we can tackle it from the first angle those who do not pray and it's established it's proven that they do not pray that defiant they're adamant not to pray a single raka they are kafir we've told them we've showed them the evidences we brought scholars and they still don't want to pray there cover the other angle that you should look at also is is it my job to label people whether they're kafir or not maybe this particular individual whom I've never seen pray maybe he preys on his own maybe if I'm going to the Masjid he prays in his room or before he goes to bed so I cannot label someone until the conditions are fulfilled and this is difficult because I have to take home take him to a court of law and the judges the Muslim judges would interrogate him and prove to him that it is mandatory and if he remains to be defiant in this case it's a different situation altogether the third angle is my kinship there my relatives so do not put obstacles and put a hurdles in front of them try your level best to connect them to vb+ call them to Islam instead of rather labeling them their catheter or not so that I would not have to call them or I must and I'm obliged to do so analyse Oh gel knows best"
