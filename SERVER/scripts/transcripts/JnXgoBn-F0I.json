  "transcript": "Sa'ad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So Sheikh, my question is that if I am doing ghusl from a major ritual community, if some semen comes out while I'm doing my ghusl, not with pleasure, just like leftover, so would I have to repeat my ghusl or should I continue and my ghusl will be valid? I don't understand, what happened while you're doing your ghusl? Some semen came out. No, if the semen that comes out, comes out like the form of methi, or when urinating, this has no impact on your ghusl. The semen that comes out in a gushing form, you ejaculate semen while accompanied by a feeling of sensation, this is what invalidates your ghusl."
