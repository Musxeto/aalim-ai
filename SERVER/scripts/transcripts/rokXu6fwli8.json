  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sorry for not asking clearly before. We have problems with Isha time and in order to solve them it's necessary to know the angle of the sun at Isha time. This is something we've spoke about Yunus so many times. Go to your Islamic center and follow what they say. The Adhan is the responsibility of the Mu'adhin. The time where the Salat enters is the responsibility of the Mu'adhin. If you don't have any reason to doubt it, meaning if he's calling the Adhan for Maghreb and you can see the sun, you must not obey him or follow him. Other than that if you don't have any clue then follow him and it's his responsibility. you"
