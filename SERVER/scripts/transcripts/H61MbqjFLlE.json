  "title": "Ruling on Male & Female Circumcision, Female Genital Mutilation, & must new Muslims get circumcised?",
  "transcript": "a questioner says what's the ruling on male and female circumcision now female circumcision we've been through this and we've said that this is not mandatory in islam and it's not similar to fgm a female genital mutilation because this is from the pharaohs era and it has no relation to islam it deprives the woman from enjoying her natural needs regarding intimacy so this is totally separate and different from islamic circumcision nevertheless it is not mandatory to have female circumcision as for the male it is mandatory to have it and this is part of sunan al-fatrah this is part of the sunni of nature so all prophets had this done prophet ibrahim was circumcised when he was 80 years of age he circumcised himself with an axe and this is mandatory because it purifies a person when he answers the call of nature and there is no remaining of urine drops that may impact his prayer nevertheless this should not deter or prevent a person from accepting islam unfortunately and unwisely when a christian comes to embrace islam and he's very interested in it those who call him to islam out of ignorance would say oh but you have to be circumcised and this may deter and prevent this person from accepting islam and this is wrong this is a trivial issue compared to his islam let him accept islam and if he's afraid that he might bleed or that this might impact his health or endanger his safety if a doctor says he's too old for it in this case is no problem in him not being circumcised but this should not be an obstacle between him and accepting islam and allah azzawajal knows best you"
