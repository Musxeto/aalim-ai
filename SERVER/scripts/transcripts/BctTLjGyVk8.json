  "title": "Does Allah have Two Eyes and Two Hands? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "uh from Canada I have a question my question is uh a Twitter a tweet from you uh a couple years ago res I just came across which speaks about Allah having two eyes and you give example of theith of Al wasallam speaking about and he says is one eye and but your lord is not one eyed so which implies that Allah is not oneeyed but it doesn't imply that Allah has two eyes but so we're really in confusion right now can you please speak about this okay says about the issue of Allah having two eyes and this is part of The Whispers of Shan when people don't study their and they rely on Twitter what do you expect the end result instead of studying classical books of AA that talks about the beautiful names and attributes of Allah instead of studying or going through the classical books of Scholars of the salaf they rely on Facebook Twitter or the brother so and so said on YouTube channel this is not religion you cannot learn your religion from such sources so yes I said this couple of years ago I don't know who's counting but this is what says and a great number of Scholars understood from the Hadith when the prophet said your lord is not one eyed okay so what does that mean it means that if I say that someone is not one eye that means he has two eyes and we know that Allah has two hands this is mentioned clearly in the Quran now people without knowledge would say that oh yeah but in other verses of the Quran Allah says our hands created and produced so Allah has more than two hands because it's a plural not knowing that in Arabic whenever a thing that is made of two we know that it is made of two we can use the plural sense to it there were two of them yet Allah says he did not say which is to this is an issue of Arabic of AA and for someone who doesn't know Arabic has little knowledge of AA it will confuse if you don't have the essence how can you understand something that is above your pay grade not because it is difficult because you did not go to elementary school you did not go to Primary School you simply wanted to go to high school and understand the math and the calculus and the physics without taking the basics of science so this is what the scholars said and this is what fits with the teachings of the Quran the Sunnah where Allah has two hands subhanahu wa taala and the Hadith said that your lord is not one eyed which people understand that he has two eyes now why not more than one uh two eyes why not so what is the confusion where is the other opinion and this is an essential question to ask because you don't want to end on the wrong side you don't want to end in the dark side of I wouldn't say the force but rather of those who think of Allah Asel in such a way that may strip Allah subhana T in their hearts from glorifying him with greatness and this is a serious problem stay away when you don't have Knowledge from discussing these things or even contemplating upon them and Allah Knows Best"
