  "title": "Wudu with Super Glue on Hands, Prayer Valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Irene from Cyprus Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam to Allah In my knowledge, performing wudu with nail polish on renders the wudu invalid due to the lack of contact of water with the nail bed. Keeping the same reasoning in mind, I was recently doing some crafts and I ended up with some super glue on my hands, covering around 5% of the surface. I performed wudu and prayed anyway. Were my wudu and prayer valid or should I repeat them? No, if the barrier prevented the water from reaching your skin, the wudu is invalid. If you are unable to remove the super glue, in this case you perform normal wudu but you perform tayammum as well. If the area is very negligible, very small, very tiny, then inshallah this is forgiven and Allah knows best."
