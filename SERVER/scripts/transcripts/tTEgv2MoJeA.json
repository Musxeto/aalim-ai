  "title": "Praying Witr like Maghrib? | AssimAlHakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "so muhammad from india he says that the people in his country pray pray witter exactly identical to the maghrib which there is a hadith where the prophet assalam prohibited this and they follow the hanafi school of thought so in the second drakai they sit down for to shahood like maghrib and then they stand up for the third rakah and they say we make a difference between maghrib and witter by adding at the third rakah and this is not valid because sometimes even in maghrib prayers we give dua when there is a calamity or something bad happening and we want allah azza to re leave us from uh from it so definitely what they're saying is wrong and what the majority of scholars say that they have to stand up after the second not sit down for to shahood is what they should do"
