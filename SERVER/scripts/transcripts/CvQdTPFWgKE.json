  "transcript": "One of the three poets of the Prophet ﷺ, when he did not catch up with the expedition with the Prophet ﷺ to Tabuk on the ninth year of Hijrah, and the Prophet came back, the hypocrites came to give their apologies. Oh, we could not come and catch up with you because this, because of that, and the Prophet would accept their apologies. Ka'b Ibn Malik and two other men from the companions said, Oh Prophet of Allah, we will not lie. We had no excuse. So the Prophet ordered the companions not to speak to them. For fifty days, they were boycotted by the whole of Medina. Nobody would communicate with them or say Salam or talk with them until Allah revealed their, his acceptance of their repentance. So when this happened, the Prophet ﷺ called Ka'b and Ka'b came and the Prophet's face was lit with joy and happiness and he says, Have the glad tiding, O Ka'b, with the best day since your mother gave birth to you. Today, when Allah has repented upon you. And he said, Is this from you or from Allah? He said, This is from Allah. The Prophet was happy for Ka'b."
