  "transcript": "The second question is from a brother who says, do bad deeds erase our good deeds? This is an issue of dispute and deeds are divided into two types. The most important and greatest of all, which is Tawheed and the rest of the good deeds, such as prayer, charity, being kind, being compassionate, being merciful, the whole nine yards. So Tawheed is not erased by any type of sin except Kufr or Shirk. So if a person falls into Kufr or Shirk, this invalidates his Tawheed as well as everything else of his good deeds. So this is the mother queen of all. If you kill it, you kill everything else. Now the other deeds such as being charitable, being generous, prayers, fasting, Hajj, Umrah, Qur'an, etc. These are good deeds that will be weighed on the Day of Judgment. So if your good deeds overweighs your sins, your sins are erased and you'll end up in Paradise. If it's the other way around and your sins overweighs your good deeds, then you will be destined to Hellfire for some time because the main good deed which is Tawheed is intact and this cannot be invalidated except with Shirk or Kufr. So you will do your time in Hell if Allah wills it and this is up to the Divine Decree, Allah's Divine Decree. And after doing your time, you will be admitted to Jannah. But if you invalidate your Tawheed, then everything else is invalidated and you're doomed in Hellfire for eternity. And I hope this answers your question."
