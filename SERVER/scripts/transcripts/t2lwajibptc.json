  "transcript": "Imad, Imad from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh He has been working 10 years in Sweden and I have been studying for 10 years Next semester In Sha Allah I will be studying in a university that is very hard to get into However I'll be forced to move away from my parents to go to another city to study This results in more rent and other expenses which I can't pay for And Alhamdulillah my father has the means to pay for all of this until I finish studying However he does not want to spend on me from his savings rather he wants to take a bank loan from the bank which is usury Naturally I don't want him to indulge in usury so I'd suggest two options The first one is that he pays for my expenses by his savings and the other one is that I take a break from studying for a few years in order to be able to pay for my expenses and I would gladly do that However my father really doesn't like both options and he gets irritated whenever I mention both of them His argument is that I might not be able to get into the university if I take a break to work And there's a good chance of that And he would be very displeased with me if I don't study next semester using his loan from the bank that he will eventually take And that's my question I love you Sheikh, may Allah bless you I love you Allah who you loved me with My dear brother You are totally right in your decision Now if you know that your father is going to borrow with haram money And you have a saying in it Then you have to stop it and block it What do you mean Sheikh? I mean if your father is going to apply for student loans in your name So you'll be the one who's paying the student loans and the loans are on you In this case it's a matter of life and death Do not accept Even if he's irritated, he's angry, whatever It's totally haram If he's the one who is applying for a personal loan on his name and his responsibility In this case this is his own actions and doing You have no power over that except to give him advice and tell him this is haram And try to convince him being polite, diplomatic and dutiful at the same time If he insists then there's nothing wrong on your side Let him take the loan You do your studies, try to excel in your university Be able to stand on your own two feet and pay back your father his hard work that he's invested in you Now there is no sin on you Now my recommendation would be is father you have savings My advice is use your savings for the university If I make it, Alhamdulillah, I'll be able to pay you back as a loan If I don't make it and your savings run out You may then take a loan that is interest based and pay it accordingly You would have shortened the amount of time where the interest is compiled upon you And this is lesser interest you have to pay And who knows maybe I manage to strike the jackpot and succeed in my university Based on your savings and it's all halal in halal and I'll pay you back for it I hope this makes sense to him and Allah knows best"
