  "transcript": "Okay, Muhammad from Senegal. Assalamu Alaikum, Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam. And you are? Muhammad from Senegal. Hayyakallah. What can I do for you, my friend? I have a question concerning pre-mixing. Yes, sir. For example, for someone who is born in a kafir country, you know where he used to be with girls, since he was a very little age, he grew up with them, they are like sisters, even if in Islam there is no sister-ship and brother-ship and that kind of things. So how can we do to cut the ties without hurting them or being rude or anything? Jazak Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazak. Akhi, this is something that is not essential in our lives. Meaning, whether we hurt them or we don't, this is beside the point. What counts at the moment is, are we in accordance to the shari'a of Islam? The answer is yes. So whether they like it or not, this is not of an issue. How to break it to them? It depends. You can send them an email and make it decisive and firm so that there won't be exchange of emails. You can tell your mahram, your sister, your mom, to contact them and tell them that, listen, this change happened because of this and that and though we had good times, but according to Islam we have to draw the line and pleasing Allah is what counts for us. And if you don't even bother and move on with your life and ghost them altogether, this is fine. You're not the last person on earth that would hurt them unintentionally or intentionally. They would live with that and move on, and Allah knows best."
