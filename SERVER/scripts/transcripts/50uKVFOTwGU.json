  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, is it from the Sunnah to sit down for a brief moment when getting up from the first Raka'a and also from the third Raka'a? This is known as Jalsa Al-Istiraha and it is found in Sahih Al-Bukhari, the Hadith narrated by Malik Ibn Al-Huwairith, may Allah be pleased with him, he said to his companions, shall I show you how the Prophet used to pray Alayhis Salatu Wassalam and he prayed in front of them and he used to sit this short pause of sitting Jalsa Al-Istiraha in odd Raka'as before going to the second or to the fourth Raka'a, before standing to the second or to the fourth Raka'a. This is known as Jalsa Al-Istiraha and it's a highly recommended Sunnah in the Shafii school of thought and the Hadith is in Sahih Al-Bukhari. So some scholars followed that, other scholars went to the Hadith of Wael Ibn Hujur that the Prophet used to stand up immediately and straightforward and I am inclined to say that this is a highly recommended Sunnah and Allah knows best.
