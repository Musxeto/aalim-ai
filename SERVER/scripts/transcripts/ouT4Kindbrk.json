  "title": "My teacher slapped me on the face, should I forgive it to get closer to Allah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "abroad from Bangladesh so a few days ago a teacher had slapped me in the face in front of everyone in class due to laughing and clapping out of excitement but I did not say any bad thing to the teacher nor I disrespected him and Allah is my witness later almost everyone started making fun of me and mocking me after the incident I repented for the mistake I made now my confusion is in which situation should I forgive and situations where I shouldn't forgive I mean what should I do in situations like this in order to get closer to Allah first of all your teacher is 100% sinful slapping people on the face is prohibited even for a father with his own son or daughter I as a father it is totally prohibited for me to slap my son or daughter water on the face let alone being a stranger a teacher secondly as Muslims we are obliged in order to respect our elders and among them of course our teachers they have rights over us due to what they had taught us and brought us from their own knowledge and given us from their own effort so if your teacher makes a mistake in a time of tension and acts in a way that is not Halal you have two courses of action number one if you did not do anything wrong to be punished go straight to the Headmaster and complain and let the Headmaster do justice now if you made a mistake it depends which country you're you're in some countries allow the teachers to discipline their students which is logical but within Islamic boundaries yes as a teacher I have to discipline my CH my my student but not to whip him or to slap him on the face or break his bones or give him a choke hold this is not part of Islam but it's also not part of ISL Lam to let the children and the students do whatever they want and go undisciplined except by deducting a Mark or putting them uh in front of the principal's office for a class or two this is not the right thing to do nevertheless it depends on the country so my advice to you is to let this slide if you did a mistake and to forgive your teacher because if he is and I hope he is a person a man not a a woman if he is or if he has been teaching you all this time he should have lots of good things good remarks good teaching that you've benefited from so let that overwhelm his mistake but if he is a totally evil person you don't have to forgive him you can demand your right on the day of judgment and don't worry about what the students say say to them and tell them that any gorilla could have fought back any animal could have defended himself a real Muslim is the one who suppresses his anger and Allah Asel Knows Best"
