  "transcript": "[Questioner] says my mom my mother-in-law says \nYou must not sweep after Maghrib what does Islam   say about this this is a misconception that \na lot of the people in the subcontinent have   and in Islam I can make up things like \ncrazy it's not permissible to drink   green tea after Maghrib oh \nwhat can I drink only coffee and this is baseless but if I \nsay it to people and they buy it   what can we can be done about \nit Islam is a religion of   common sense of logic that is based entirely on \nevidences you cannot speak of thin air and come up   with a resolution or a verdict and say Simon Says \ndo this so you tell me I can't sweep after sunset   show me the evidence there's none in the Quran \nor in the Sunnah so this is bogus I will not   accept this people say on Wednesday you \ncan't clip your nails subhan Allah why   hairdressers and and body cure and manicure \nare not working on on Wednesdays hello so all   of these things are rubbish they're baseless I got \na question the other day maybe today or yesterday   stating that my mother-in-law says that dragging \nyour feet because my shoes are heavy I can't lift   my foot up so I drag my feet and this makes a \nscratching noise on the ground some people are   lazy you know they they pull their legs on the \nground and she says to me this is prohibited and   sinful I said why she said because you're hurting \nthe ground yeah did the ground complain to you   so if we dig the Earth to or plow \nthe Earth to plant seeds and crops   this hurts the Earth what is this so don't \nlisten to nonsense especially that which the   elders say without any evidence from the Quran \nor the Sunnah or the books of or the people of   knowledge they just make up stories and and the \nlikes and it has no Foundation none whatsoever"
