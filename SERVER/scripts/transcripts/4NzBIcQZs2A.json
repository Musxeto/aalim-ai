  "transcript": "Rahma from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, what are the actions necessary to unite the Ummah? How can an individual make a difference in achieving that goal? Jazak Allah Khair Wa Jazakum Akhi, to unite the Ummah is a way, way, way, way above our pay grade objective. And never ever you will find Allah addressing us to do something of that magnitude. Allah tells us, abide by the rope of Allah. So we have to abide by the rope of Allah. Which means that we have to abide by the Qur'an and by the Sunnah. And to obey our Muslim rulers. These are the basics of Islam. Now a lot of those ISIS, NISIS supporters, Khawarij and the likes would get on their heels and say, oh this is this and this is that, sue me. This is the religion of Allah. Allah tells us in the Qur'an and in the Sunnah, the Prophet clearly indicates that we must obey the Muslim rulers even if we don't like them. What can we do? Choose another Sunnah. Go and choose another religion. I can't change the religion of Allah. If you don't like the Muslim rulers, tough bananas. This is the religion of Allah. So to unite the Ummah we have to go to the basics. What are the basics? Obeying by the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the authentic Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations, companions, tabi'een, tabi'at tabi'een. There's no way out of this at all. And this is clearly mentioned in the Qur'an and in the Sunnah. Now for you and I to be fair and square, to discuss such a thing without looking at our own selves and families, that would be ridiculous. Someone says, okay let's talk about how to unite the Ummah. Okay, you don't pray Fajr in the Masjid. You don't pray at all in the Masjid. And you don't abide by the Sunnah, you're clean shaven. Or you don't, you're not fair with your wife, you're not treating her well, she's not abiding by the hijab, you cheat, you lie, you don't come on time to work, you take money unlawfully from the company or from others, blah blah blah. Anyone to unite the Ummah, wake up. I'm not talking to you, Rahma, I'm just saying. For us to unite the Ummah, we have to align our lives with the Qur'an and the Sunnah with the understanding of the favorite three generations. Then Allah would make this happen. But before that, it's not going to happen, not in a gazillion years. Only Allah knows best."
