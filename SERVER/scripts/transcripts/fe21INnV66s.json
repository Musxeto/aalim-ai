  "title": "Why are there contradictions between the Hanafi School of Thought & Authentic Hadiths? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "uh fahar from Pakistan I have a confusion that why is there so many contradictions between the hanafi school of thought dating teachings according to the authentic Hadith comparing them okay I will answer in Sharma uh may Allah have mercy on his soul wrote a small booklet which is very beneficial and it it really needs people to understand it it's called Alam uplifting the blame from all the high esteemed uh imams of schools of thought how do we uplift the blame how can we not blame them for differing and causing this chaos that we see he explains that how Islam spread and I've done this in one of the courses I've was fortunate to do in Malaysia a couple of years ago to talk about the origin of firk maybe if Allah gives us life and and time we may do this course in Huda TV if Allah is willing inshallah so all the companions nobody gave fatwa or a ruling except the prophet after his death the companion started to come up with opinions of Their Own according to the Quran the Sunnah and The prominent uh companions were Abdullah in Iraq Abdullah even abbased in Medina these are the four prominent Companions and from there came tabirin who became the imams and the scholars or the or the teachers of the four prominent imams so the first Imam of the four schools Abu hanifa compared to Malik who was in Medina surrounded by all the tabirin who took all their knowledge from the companions so he was in a very fertile ground taking all the sunnis from everywhere that's why he has his book to Egypt and he learned from so many of the Tiberian who was scattered all over the place and gained knowledge and then we have finally Ahmed who traveled a lot almost everywhere and collected his huge book called al-musnet Muslim Ahmed with narrations of different types of companions because he traveled a lot Abu hanifa did not travel he was a merchant and he was one of the brightest individuals ever of humans with an intellectual Powers but he didn't travel so whatever little knowledge he had from the Hadith due to the lack of the number of companions who collected Hadith and relayed them to their students the tabirin and he collected those from because of the little amount of tabian he heard and learned from his school of thought is based on logic so the one plus one equals two logical so by default this issue requires this a particular thing that's logical this is why he did not have the same amount of knowledge to rely on like Imam Malik like Imam shafri like Imam Ahmed yet he had the honor and the dignity to declare it to all of his students whenever you hear an authentic Hadith this is my opinion toss my own opinion across the street follow the Hadith because this is what I believe and this is what I worship Allah with so he put this disclaimer so that people when they come and say Abu hanifa says so and so but there is a Hadith that says that there is no marriage without a guardian says it's okay to get married without a guardian well he put a disclaimer saying I didn't hear of such a Hadith if the Hadith is authentic it is what I believe in you have to follow that blind followers don't want to follow this aspect this is why we have this confusion and Allah knows that"
