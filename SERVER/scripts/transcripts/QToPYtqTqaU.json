  "title": "How to dispose of baby’s hair after Aqeeqah (bury or throw in sea or river)?",
  "transcript": "Finally, Mansour says, in Pakistan after shaving \na newborn's head on the seventh day, most people   either bury the hair or throw it in the sea \nor the river. Is this from the sunnah? If not,   then is there any haram in doing it? It is not \nfrom the sunnah. All the hadiths that govern this   issue of burying it, or throwing it in the desert, \nor in the sea, etc., they're all not authentic.   There are some narrations of the companions, but \nstill they're not authentic. So if you do this,   no problem. But if you throw it in the dustbin, \nlike everybody else does, again there is no   problem, there's no harm of the jinn coming and \nmaking things over it as many people may think."
