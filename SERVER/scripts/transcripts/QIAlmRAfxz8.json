  "transcript": "In the name of Allah, the most gracious, the most merciful All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon the messenger of Allah, the mercy of the worlds. Our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his family and companions and those who are guided by his guidance and hold on to his Sunnah until the Day of Judgment. As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. This is the second episode of our study of the biography of the Prophet ﷺ. There is no doubt that the prophets are the most perfect of people in creation and character. They are the highest and most honorable of them in lineage. Therefore, as it was proven in the Sahih (al-Bukhari 2940), during the period of the treaty between the Muslims and the disbelievers of Quraysh, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb went while he was a disbeliever to Sham. He brought with him Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, and put him in front of his companions. He instructed his companions that if he lies once then inform me He asked him about certain things. And from what he asked him about, his lineage ﷺ. He said, how is his lineage among you? Abu Sufyan said, he is of (great) lineage among us. Heraclius said, or the leader of the Byzantines, the same way the messengers are sent in the lineage of their people. And this is the Sunnah (way) of Allah Almighty in His prophets and messengers, that they are usually among the most honorable of people because they are the messengers of Allah Almighty. So they must have a lineage and honor in their people. So who is the Prophet ﷺ? He is Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib. Ibn Hashim, Ibn Abdi Manaf, Ibn Qusay, Ibn Kilab, Ibn Murrah, Ibn Ka'ab, Ibn Luay, Ibn Ghalib, Ibn Fihr, Ibn Malik, Ibn Nadr, Ibn Kinanah, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Mudraka, Ibn Ilyas, Ibn Mudar, Ibn Nizar, Ibn Ma'd, Ibn Adnan. As it is mentioned in al-Bukhari (above 3851) And there is no difference of opinion in this. And Adnan is from the descendants of Ismail. This pure, noble lineage, the Prophet ﷺ is reported as saying:\n(cf. dalail al-Nabawiyyah li Abi Nu'aym 15 with very weak isnad) I did not cease to move between the loins of men and in the best of lineages from Nikah to Nikah And you will not find in his lineage ﷺ any fornication you will not find Zina, Haram It is only Nikah to Nikah from the best to the best. Until he was born ﷺ  Wathirah Ibn Al-Asqa', may Allah be pleased with him said, the Prophet ﷺ said, Allah chose Ismail from the son of Abraham, peace be upon them. And he chose Bani Kinanah from the son of Ismail. And he chose Quraysh from Bani Kinanah. And he chose Bani Hashim from Qurasyh. And he chose me from Bani Hashim. And this hadith, its origin is in Sahih Muslim (2276) And al-Tirmidhi reported it in his Sunan (3605) The Messenger ﷺ is from the most honorable of his people. His father is Abdullah Ibn Abdul Muttalib. And he was one of the most beautiful, best-looking and gifted youth of Quraysh. And he was loved by his father with great love. And Abdul Muttalib is the master of Quraysh. His mother is Aminah bint Wahb. Her father was the master of Bani Zuhra. In honour, her family was a well-known, prestigious, of great lineage in Quraysh And the grandfather of the Prophet ﷺ is Abdul Muttalib. He is the master of the tribe of Quraysh. And he has a noble lineage. And he was famous for great things, such as his digging of the Zamzam well. The Zamzam well, its beginning and origin as we know, (cf. al-Bukhari 3364) Is when Ismail was a baby, he hit the ground with his foot so the water of Zamzam gushed out of it Then the people in that desolate valley increased, which had no crops or life. But it was the call of Ibrahim ﷺ. When he left Hajar and her son Ismail. And she said, O Ibrahim, to whom are you leaving us in this (desolate) valley? No crops, no life, no human being. And he does not respond to her ﷺ. Until she asked him a clear question, did Allah command you to do this? He said, yes. She said, then he will not let us down. This tawakkul (reliance), this faith, this dependence on Allah Almighty, resulted in her and her son entering that valley. When the Zamzam gushed out, the tribes came from all directions. And they knew that that place is desolate, there is no water in it and there is no life in it. So they asked permission to establish there, and she allowed them and Ismail married from among them. And the life of the Arabs began at that time. Then a time came and this water was scattered and gone. And Zamzam was covered. So Abdul Muttalib saw, and he was the master of Quraysh. He saw in a dream three times someone ordering him to dig Zamzam, and he did not know where it was. And in the fourth time, he was told to show where it was. So he went and dug Zamzam. And the water poured out and exited, so he did takbeer and the valley trembled with his takbeer So the Quraysh knew that he found Zamzam, so they came to him. They said, we are with you in (sharing) Zamzam, join us in it. He said, no, I saw it in a dream and dug it so I am the one who takes it. So they were harsh on him in speech and were heavy upon them while they were the majority And he did not have a son at that time, except Al-Harithah Ibn Abdul Muttalib. So they overpowered him against it, and he vowed in his vow at that time that if Allah Almighty provides him with ten children, He will slaughter one of them, to get closer to Allah A strange vow and strange gratitude for a blessing from Allah Almighty to the person. But this is what happened. So when they fought about Zamzam, and who will take care of him and be responsible for it, he said, we will seek judgement. So they agreed to seek judgment from a fortune teller in the north of the island. They set out on a journey and went And between them and that fortune teller were deserts So they stopped at the road, and they drank all the water they had. So they asked for the water from the neighboring tribes, but they refused to give them. And they said, we are thirsty for water like you, and we fear that if we give you, we will be thirsty. So when they felt they are about to die of thirst, then they said, what should we do? If we die now, we would become corpses, eaten by the birds  So they came down on the opinion of Abdul Muttalib. And they said, you are our superior and you are our noblest, and we come down on your opinion. So he pointed out to them that each one should dig his grave and lie down next to it. So if one of them dies, they throw him in his grave and bury him. So he said, in this way, the majority of us will be buried and their bodies will be preserved, and the last one will be the one who is lost. And one person losing is better than everyone losing So they did as he ordered them to do. Then after they had finished doing it, he said to them, by Allah, what is this opinion? We should look for water, instead of dying like this, there is no good in it. So when his camel stood up, water emitted below its feet  So the people did takbeer, and they drank, and they lived, and Abdul Muttalib called those neighboring tribes to drink, and to drink, and to take what they wanted to take. So people knew that this sign was from Allah the Almighty to Abdul Muttalib, that Zamzam is the one to quench their thirst And the story after that is well-known. As for the issue of vowing to slaughter (his son). This is a grave issue And for this reason the Prophet ﷺ is known as \"the son of the two slaughtered ones\" Why was he called \"the son of the two slaughtered ones\"? The first slaughtering was of Ismail, the son of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, who saw in a dream that he, Ibrahim ﷺ, was slaughtering his son, and Allah Almighty saved him with a great ram, as is known. As for Abdullah, the son of Abdul Muttalib, when the sons of Abdul Muttalib became abundant, and multiplied, and he had ten sons, he wanted to fulfill his promise. So he made a pledge between his sons, and the lot drew on the most beloved in their heart, and he was Abdullah. So he was confused about his decision, and he didn't know what to do. It was said that he made a second and third lot, and it remained on Abdullah. So he asked, and they pointed to him to draw a lot between Abdullah and ten camels. Meaning, I ransom Abdullah by slaughtering ten camels So the lot drew on Abdullah, and he repeated this process until it drew between Abdullah and a hundred camels, so lot drew on a hundred camels, and he ransomed his son with that, and slaughtered a hundred camels. And this is how the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was known as Ibn Al-Dhabihayni ﷺ When was he born? The scholars differed on the day of his birth. It was said its \"on the 9th\", and it was said \"on the 10th\" or \"the 8th\", and it was said that on \"the 12th\" of Rabi' al-Awwal And the opinion that is closest to research is that he was born on the ninth of the Rabi' al-Awwal, and that he was born on Monday And Allah's Messenger ﷺ was asked about the reason for his fasting on Mondays He said, It is the day I was born, and the day I was sent (as messenger) as Imam Muslim narrated in his Sahih (1162) So the Prophet ﷺ would fast every Monday because he was born and sent on that day And this, of course, does not mean that if I was born on Wednesday, I fast every Wednesday, because this is not legislated and not from the Sunnah. And if a person says that Allah's Messenger did this, we say that the Prophet ﷺ did this for two reasons, birth and revelation. And you were not sent (as messenger) nor revealed upon after that, and you will never be revealed upon So, this becomes an innovation (bid'ah) if you do this. We have a break, and after that we will continue, by the will of Allah, the Exalted. Peace and Allah's mercy be upon you. The Prophet ﷺ was born on Monday, on the ninth of Rabi al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant. And what is the year of the elephant? We know that the Chinese now, for years, have been historizing the year of the animals. They have certain animals, the year of the monkey, the year of the Beaver, the year of the mouse, the year of the so on. So, is this from this type? Never. The Arabs in their days did not have a calendar that they followed for years. So, they used to date the history with the events. For example, the war of Dahis and Ghabra, the war of the Fujoor or Fujjar, and so on. The year of the elephant, the year of drought and so on, according to the physical events that took place. So, the Prophet ﷺ was born in the year of the elephant. And what is the year of the elephant? It is a year in which the ruler of Yemen tried his best to invade Mecca and destroy the Kaaba. And Yemen was a place of conflict, as it is nowadays. So, at a certain time, it was overruled by the Abyssinians. And when the Prophet ﷺ was born, Yemen was being overruled by the Najashi. And after his mission ﷺ Yemen became overruled by the Persians and the Magians. So, it was a place of conflict between the forces, between the Christians and the worshipers of the fire from the Magians. So, it is narrated that Abraha, by order of the Najashi, when he saw the Arabs approaching the Kaaba, he wanted to build a huge building, a church, so that people would look at it instead of the Kaaba. So, he built that church and invited the Arabs to enter it and worship Allah, Almighty, in it. So, one of the Arabs stood up and his jealousy overtook him He came with rubbish and smeared the inside of the church May Allah 'Azza wa Jall honour you all. He came with impurities and smeared the inside of the church to disgrace it. So, the Najashi became angry about that. And he is not Aṣḥamah, companion of the Prophet ﷺ  whom he ﷺ prayed upon (Janazah) and assisted the Muslims and welcomed them in the Hijrah to Abyssinia This is not the case. The Najashi is a name for everyone who owns the Abyssinians. Like Heraclius is a name for those who owns the Byzantine, and Caesar is a name for those who own the Persians, and the Muqawqis for the Qibat, and so on. So, he became very angry about that, and he ordered his leader, Abraha, to go and destroy the Kaaba. So he brought a huge army with an Elephant The Arabs did not know about Elephants, and Elephants are scary If you see one, you will be afraid of it. So what about one who doesn't know it to begin with and hasn't seen it neither in images nor in documentaries All you see is an elephant. What can you do about that? It is a disaster. So, this army came to destroy the Kaaba. You know the story that Abdul Muttalib came and asked for permission, and he gave permission to him, and when he saw him, he was a big, strong, and powerful man. He gave him to him and respected him. So, Abdul Muttalib asked him to give him a piece of sheep. His men took it, and he said, You fell down in my eyes. I thought you came to defend the house that you glorify and honor. And now you came to me with some sheep? He said: I am the owner of the sheep and I take care of them But the house has a Lord who protects it. So, he continued on his way, So Allah sent \"against them birds in flocks, Striking them with stones of hard clay and He made them like eaten straw.\" [Surah Feel] So, he destroyed that army with a soldier from Allah's soldiers, small birds, carrying two stones in their legs and one stone in their beak. He threw them and it eroded the army one of it went in from the head and exited from his behind and thus it killed him, destroyed him And the elephant could not, as the narration says, move forward a single step. Because Allah, Almighty, is the one who held him. If they directed him to the south, meaning to Yemen again, he moved. If they directed him to the east or west, he moved. But if they directed him to the north, towards Mecca, it stopped. And something similar happened on the day of Hudaybiyah. When al-Qaswa, she-camel of the Prophet ﷺ stopped [cf. al-Bukhari 2731] and it disobeyed to move forward towards Mecca, they said, Al-Qaswa has become stubborn He said ﷺ she has not become stubborn nor is it her character  No, never! it has not rebelled Nor is this from her habits or her character. Rather, she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant. As the Prophet ﷺ said. So, in this year, the birth of the Prophet ﷺ took place. And, Subhan Allah, if you ponder on the wisdoms, and time does not allow to expand, but if you contemplate on the wisdom, that Allah, Almighty, why did He defend Quraysh while they are Mushrikun, and they are the worshippers of idols? The scholars said, Allah, Almighty, did not honor Quraysh for their disbelief or their polytheism. Never! But He honored them by defending them, glorifying His House and glorifying His Prophet ﷺ If Abraha succeeded in the invasion of Mecca, then the mother of the Prophet ﷺ who was pregnant with him, would become a slave woman and the Prophet Mohammad Salla Allahu alaihi wa Sallam would become a slave Allah, Almighty, wanted that to be a sign of His Prophethood ﷺ by defending His House, and that noble land, the sacred land, in which the Prophet ﷺ were born. When the Prophet ﷺ was born, Most authentic that has been narrated is that the mother of the Prophet ﷺ saw light coming out of her spreading throughout al-Sham [Ahmad 17151/17648] As for ewan kusra being trembled, its balconies destroyed and the disappearance of the fire etc all of these are narrations with no authenticity, not proven Some people like to put some spices, salt, or black pepper, to make the meal more delicious, and this is wrong, because the origin is that a person does not lie or put these things from his pocket. So, this is the birth of the Prophet ﷺ with history and the incidents that surrounded it. It is a great incident, but unfortunately, people have been deviated by the Shaytan, and he has lured them until many Muslims celebrate the birthday of the Prophet ﷺ every year. And this is a great mistake. According to the ijmaa' of Muslim scholars, and according to the Muslims as a whole, the Prophet ﷺ, Allah took his soul on the 12th of Rabi'ul Awwal. There is no difference of opinion Was he born on this day or not? As mentioned earlier, there is a difference of opinion Correct is that he was born on the 9th. So, the one who celebrates the birthday of the Prophet ﷺ is a lover. He claims that he loves the Prophet ﷺ and we have no doubt about that. But not every lover attains the (right) path The one who celebrates the birthday of the Prophet ﷺ is a man who has created an evil innovation. Why? Because the Prophet ﷺ said, Whoever does something in this affair of ours not commanded by us, it is rejected [Sahih Muslim 1718] Did the Prophet celebrate his birthday ﷺ? They said, yes, he fasted Mondays. We clarified that. We said that he fasted Mondays for being sent (as messenger) and for his birth. And that wasn't legislated for anyone from his ummah. Did any of his companions celebrate his birthday, and they are the greatest people to love him? May Allah be pleased with them all. Never. Did the Tabi'un or Tabi' al-tabi'en ever celebrate his birthday? Never. So, how can we come up with an evil innovation? while the Prophet ﷺ said: (al-Bukhari 3650 & Muslim 2533) the best of the generations is my generation, and those who follow them, then those who follow them. There is no doubt that this is an evil innovation. This innovation only appears in the 4th century. and It is said that in the 7th century, it was spread by the al-'ubaydiyyun, al-batiniyyun (from the Shi'ah) who wanted to destroy the religion in more than one way, including the innovating and invention in the religion of Allah, the Exalted and the Most High. And there is no doubt that whoever wants to celebrate and celebrate his birthday ﷺ must come to the houses from its doors, and that is by establishing his sunnah in his life. This person who claims that he loves the Messenger ﷺ and celebrates his birthday, or birthdays, and does what he does, claiming that he loves the Messenger ﷺ but he does not pray Fajr in the mosque. This is an abandoning contrary to the sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ He came with a great command. This person does not place Hijab on his women or his daughters, and does not cover them from the eyes of the intruders. He listens to the Haram, and looks at the Haram, and eats the Haram, and deals with the Haram. How can he be answered? (hinting to Sahih Muslim 1015) This man's claim is cold and incorrect, because if he loved him, he would obey him. Indeed, the one who loves obeys whom he loves (poem) This is one of the things that Muslims should be aware of. The Messenger ﷺ did he meet his father? Correct is that his father died while he was a fetus in his mother's womb. He was six months old. And the scholars have differed whether the Messenger ﷺ was born or not in his father's life. Correct is that he was not born. And this is the greatest, and the most perfect orphan. The orphan in the language is the one whose father died and did not reach the age of maturity. We come to some brothers who are 40 years old and say, I swear I am an orphan. How is he an orphan? The orphan is the one who did not reach maturity. And if he reached maturity, he was no longer an orphan. The Prophet ﷺ was the most perfect orphan because his father died while he was still a fetus in his mother's womb. The Arabs had a custom of breastfeeding. It was customary for women to breastfeed the children of others. The Prophet ﷺ was breastfed by two women. Thuwaybah, the slave woman of Abu Lahab, (the uncle of the Prophet ﷺ) and Halimah Al-Sa'diyah. As for the slave of Abu Lahab, Thuwaybah, when the news reached Abu Lahab that the Prophet ﷺ was born, it is narrated that he freed her with joy with that good news. It is also narrated, but the hadith is not authentic, that Allah relieved him on Mondays in the fire of hell. But this narration is not authentic, although it was famous among many people. And from those who were breastfed alongside the Prophet ﷺ... Thuwaybah, Abu Salama Al-Asadi, and Hamza Ibn Abdul Muttalib. These three are brothers in breastfeeding. Then Halimah Al-Sa'diyah breastfed him. The reason of breastfeeding among the Arabs is that they used to say, whoever was raised in the city, his thoughts became numb and his speech is not fluent But the one raised in the desert, his mind is bright, his thoughts became sharp, and well-spoken He learned the Arabic language, the Fusha, from its foundations. So what is the story of Halimah's breastfeeding to the Prophet ﷺ? And how did she achieve this great honor when she did not expect to breastfed this orphan and this poor? This is what, God willing, we will study after the break. Stay with us. The Story of Halimah Al-Sa'diyah Peace be upon you. Halimah Al-Sa'diyah is like the women of her tribe. They went to Mecca during the season. It is the capital, the largest city, the greatest and the most noble of all in lineage She was looking for her livelihood. Because if she gave birth to a child for a rich man, he would get some money and some good. So she went to Mecca with her companions But she was in a difficult financial situation. Even the she-camel given to her was the last of its kind Because of her weakness and her age, drought, so the people were in poverty So she arrived in Mecca as the last generation. She was surprised that her companions took all the children of the rich. Because they arrived before her. She found only that orphan, Muhammad Ibn Abdullah. ﷺ His father passed away and his mother was Aminah. She did not expect anything good from him ﷺ. She hesitated to accept him ﷺ . But she was shy to return to her companions Each of them had a son and she returned them without a son. She accepted him hesitantly. Glory be to Allah, how she opened the doors of goodness for this blessed boy. She saw that with her own eyes. She rode her camel until it became the fastest of the camels. People were surprised by the movement of that weak camel. It became the fastest and strongest camel. When she took the boy, she complained about the lack of milk. Because the milk was enough for her and her son and more When she sent the shepherd with her sheep to graze, the sheep would not go except the most fertilized places So the people would send their sheep behind her sheep. Because she would go to a place where Allah would bless her. Allah would increase therein and fertilise. And goodness is from Allah. so she saw the blessings. So when she completed 2 years of breastfeeding, she wanted an increase. She complained to her mother that she is afraid of the urban atmosphere She was afraid of his health so her mother accepted to keep him for two more years. The prophet ﷺ grew up in the desert of Bani Sa'ad. He was about four years old when the story of splitting the heart happened. This incident is recorded in the Sahih (Muslim 162) and the books of the biography. It is a strange incident. But it is not more strange than Isra and Mi'raaj. It is not more strange than the revelation of Allah to him in a moment. It is not more strange than the split of the moon, the talk of the stone, or the sprouting of water from his hand. These are miracles and they are successive. The split of the chest happened twice. According to the majority of the people of Seerah It is said that it happened thrice but correct is that it happened only twice. The first time was in Bani Sa'ad. He was playing with the kids. Gabriel came and took him and the children were watching. He opened his chest and took out his heart. He washed it in a pot of gold with Zamzam water. He cleaned it and put it back again. Then he stitched his chest again. Anas says, I still see the effects of the split in his chest ﷺ This is a strange incident. This is the first surgery in human history. No one could do this in that time with the tools they had. In Sahih Imam Muslim (162), Anas Ibn Malik says that the Prophet came to Gabriel while he was playing with the kids. He took him and opened his chest and took out his heart. He took out a clot from his chest and said, this is the portion of Shaytan in you He washed it in a pot of gold with Zamzam water. then he stitched it i.e connected them together and placed it in its original place The kids came running to their mother (the woman who breastfed him) and said, Muhammad has been killed. They all rushed towards him while his color changed Anas says, I saw the marks of the needle on his chest ﷺ This is a strange incident but it is destined and it is for wisdom. All the actions of the Lord Almighty are for wisdom and knowledge. He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise. He returned to the woman who breastfed him, (Halima) while his colour changed after this surgery which was the first of its kind  She was afraid of him and was afraid that he would die while he was in her care and responsibility She returned to his mother and handed him over to her He stayed with his mother for almost two years due to a dispute between the people of knowledge. She died when he was six years old. She was in Medina and returned from Medina. She was visiting the maternal uncles of Abdullah. In the books of the biography, you hear them say, the maternal uncles of the Prophet ﷺ are from Bani Zahra. From the family of Aminah But the maternal uncles of his father, Abdullah, are from the Bani Al-Najjar of Medina. So the people of Seerah go beyond They say, he was visiting his maternal uncles. No, not the maternal uncles of the Messenger ﷺ but the maternal uncles of his father. But the Arabs may say to the maternal uncles of the father that they are the maternal uncles of the man himself. While she was returning, she turned ill and Allah Almighty took her life in the graves and was buried there. The Messenger ﷺ, his father died when he was six months old while being a fetus in his mother's womb. His mother died while he was 6 years old  So his grandfather 'Abdul Muttalib took care of him And he used to love him with great love, nothing like it. The leader of Quraysh! He had a bed in the shade of the Ka'bah, none of his sons would sit on it And when Prophet ﷺ would come out as he was a small kid He would sit on the bed and his uncles would come to him intending to put him down he would refuse. Abdul Muttalib, his grandfather, would say to them, leave him alone, this son of mine has a (special) status He would sit next to him and hug him, kiss him, embrace him and love him with great love. No doubt that if a child felt this love, he would give him a greater love. Allah, Almighty, wills  And Allah 'Azza wa Jall takes the soul of Abdul Muttalib,  and the Messenger ﷺ  is 8 years old Glory be to Allah. From death to death to death. And he did not exceed eight years of age. If you look at his biography ﷺ you will know that Allah, Almighty, wanted to maintain the relationship of the Prophet ﷺ with one of the human beings. And that no one should raise the Prophet ﷺ except the Lord of the human beings, Almighty. \"Did He not find you an orphan and give you refuge? And He found you lost and guided you? And He found you poor and made you self-sufficient.? [surah al-Duha] This is Allah, Almighty, The Planner, The Sustainer Glory be to Him, The Highest He is the One Who raised His Prophet ﷺ The father of the Prophet ﷺ and his mother, as it is mentioned in Sahih Muslim (203 & 976) are both in hell. And this is a matter that scholars have been arguing about since ancient times. And the reason for the disagreement is their love for the Prophet ﷺ and their desire that those whom he loves to be in Gardens of Bliss. But we, as Muslims, cannot put ourselves before Allah and His Messenger ﷺ We stand with the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and we go wherever they go. In Sahih Muslim (203), it is mentioned that a man said, O Messenger of Allah, where is my father? He said, Your father is in hell. As if the man found something in himself. He said to him ﷺ Indeed my father and your father are in hell. And this is a clarification from him ﷺ A clarification from him that his father, Abdullah, is in hell. And it is mentioned in Sahih Muslim (976) that the Prophet ﷺ cried one day and was asked, O Messenger of Allah, what made you cry? He said, I asked permission from my Lord to ask forgiveness for my mother, but He did not allow me. And I asked permission from Him to visit her grave and He allowed me. so this is a clear, explicit hadith in the permissibility of visiting the grave of a kafir/mushrik for the sake of visiting and consideration, not for supplication. And also that the Prophet ﷺ, Allah did not allow him to ask forgiveness for his mother. and a person may say: Are not the parents of the Prophet ﷺ from the Ahl al-Fatrah? This is a matter that is discussed all the time and is extensively researched in the books of creed. However, what concerns us is that the hadith of Allah's Messenger takes precedence . As for what will happen on the Day of Resurrection, this is in the hands of Allah, Almighty. And Allah Almighty knows best and knowledge is submitted to him So we do not add to what was mentioned about the Prophet ﷺ The one who was entrusted to him after after his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, was his uncle Abu Talib. And that was with permission from his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, before Allah Almighty took him. And with this we come to the end of today's lesson. In the hope of meeting you, in sha Allah in the third lesson. Until then, I bid you farewell. Assalamu 'alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh"
