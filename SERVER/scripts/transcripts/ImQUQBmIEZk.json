  "transcript": "suay from the UK okay my question is um I know it looks like it is related to my last question but this time is still about saliva when I wake up but this time the first La I spit is usually yellow and has some it has brownish to it it's brown so I don't know this brown if it's blood or not and it's like mostly there so should I um take it as something that breaks my f go and check with the dentist and they'll tell you what's happening with you second question she says if I'm fasting and I wake up and there's uh my gum is bleeding and there are there are dry um traces of blood on my tongue or in my on my teeth in my mouth if you know that they exist you should not swallow that you should go and ren your mouth and spit it out if you wake up unknowingly and you swallow any of it unintentionally your fasting is [Music] valid does saliva mucus traces of blood if we swallow it would it break On's fast a lot of the people who are ocds obsessive compulsive disorder always keep on spitting their saliva and this is totally Haram it's totally prohibited saliva is part of your own body so to swallow your own saliva is no problem even the mucus it's not healthy but it's something inside your body swallowing it does not have impact on your prayer or your fasting but it's healthier to take it out but if you swallow it there's no problem in that as for the blood and this is understood when a person visits a dentist for example and he does some work and his gum bleeds so is it permissible to swallow that the answer is no swallowing your own blood of course other people blood unless you're a vampire is totally prohibited so you have to refrain from that to the best of your ability because again sometimes you're unable to do this it's your saliva and you have to swallow it you you tried your level best to not to if you do it unintentionally there's no problem in that but doing it intentionally this affects your fasting and one should not do that at all [Applause]"
