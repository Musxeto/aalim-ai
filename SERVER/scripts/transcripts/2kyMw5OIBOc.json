  "title": "WHO ARE THE TRUSTWORTHY SCHOLARS? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "how to know which one is to be trusted or not this is a different issue we have to look at the conduct of the scholar or the unit of knowledge we have to look at those who praised such a scholar or a student of knowledge because appearing on it on your TV screens does not make a person a scholar it makes him a lucky person he got a chance to come and address you but you have to scrutinize a person so if you see someone free mixing with women flirting with women listening to music doesn't have a clear path or men hedge when it comes to akkada everything is okay it's a cocktail let's go ahead and do it this is not someone you should follow if you see someone who does not have consistency so ten years ago he was calling to the meb of a man has Ovilus uno aljahmeir and the peda of a set of a sala and he flipped he changed to the dark side as they say and he is no longer promoting the manager of the Salaf and he thinks that he is better virgin and more knowledgeable or he's introducing bidden or he is collaborating with the people of bida this son is someone that you should leave aside if you see someone who is a super trooper and he thinks that no I am the only one around who's right everybody's wrong this day I would will he is not on the man hatch this guy is an innovator this guy he is probably from the his B's or from this or and start labeling people like you have mentioned in your third question which we will come to then again this is bad news and Allah knows best"
