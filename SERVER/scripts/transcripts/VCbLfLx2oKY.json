  "transcript": "uh okay muhammad says my college has banned hijab because of interim orders from the high court of karnataka karnataka in india due to hijab rao which took place recently after two days we've got exams and they won't allow girls to sit in the exam hall with hijab girls who go to a co-education schools and colleges are facing this problem of hijab because if they study in all girls institutions it wouldn't be a problem to sit in schools and colleges without the hijab kindly advice i think we've talked about this before and hijab is mandated by allah you don't need a high court to permit you to wear it or not but as a muslim you have to comply with allah's orders so if allah tells you to pray in the high court says you don't pray who will you follow if allah mandates that you wear the hijab and cover yourself and the high courts say no you can't do that you have to take your hijab off who will you obey this is the cross road this is the fork of the road where you have to decide and choose whether you want to go to jannah which means that you have to follow allah's commands and orders or you'd rather take your chances and go for dunya disobeying allah azzawajal and it is actually a no-brainer but unfortunately people are so distant from sharia from the quran from the sunnah and all what they think of is worldly matters rather than what pleases allah and what allah wants of them in some european countries i see that muslims who send their children to public schools in the scandinavian countries sweden nor norway denmark whatever if they force your children to take off their clothes would you still say what can we do sheikh they have to study they have to learn etc this is problem a big problem you have to choose between islam and obeying the system and you know that obeying the system would cost to destroy your islam and your children's faith how is it possible that a man allows his boys to go to mixed schools when they're 15 or 16 years of age in the prime of their youth and have physical education classes with the opposite gender sharing the same swimming pool maybe playing games water polo or whatever they uh call it boys and girls how do you allow your girls to go to such schools and then you say what can we do sheikh this is a system for education we have to for the sake of education what do you mean for the sake of education as if you're going for jihad it's for the sake of allah what are you doing so here is where you come to a crossroads you and janna or you want this dunya you want this do you then don't come crying to me after a few years saying that sheikh my daughter ran away with her boyfriend and she's living with him in haram relationship or even worse my son is lgbtq plus now he's uh out of the closet and he has a boyfriend and they've been living together and they're planning to get married don't come to me crying and say what what do i do this is what you saw and this is what you harvest so you have to make a choice and also muhammad our daughters and sisters have to make a choice do they choose islam over anything else or they just like cows follow the system and haram things this is a very critical point they have to decide what if they take their hijab and take their exams next year they say well you have to wear short sleeves uh and expose your neck and and some of your cleavage or maybe come in a bikini you never know will it ever end the humiliation the oppression of muslims you never know where it will end we've seen in these scandinavian countries in some european countries where they're abducting the authorities are taking the children away from their families especially muslim families and they allege that they're mistreating their own children as if these disbelievers these kafirs take care of our children more than us so they look for any reason and they just take your children away and they confiscate them probably giving them to christian families to raise them up as christians what are you going to do till when are you going to be oppressed and accept to be treated like doormats you brought this to yourself you went to there to them seeking their benefits seeking their standard of living so celery you"
