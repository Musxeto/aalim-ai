  "transcript": "finally can i make multiple umrah in one trip for my deceased parents first of all the question is divided into two types what's your ruling on repeating the umrah and what's the gap between them and doing more than one umrah in one trip beginning with the second question doing more than one umrah in the same journey was never done by the companions may allah be pleased with them and they knew better so the prophet only performed one umrah in one trip though he stayed in one of his journeys for 19 days in makkah so he could have done multiple umrahs for mother khadija for hamza his uncle for anyone of his loved ones but he didn't as for the gap between umrahs there isn't any gap mentioned so if a person would like to perform umrah frequently he's in compliance with the sunnah the prophet said that repeat continuously between hajj and umrah because they purify you from sins and poverty like the bellows purify the gold and and the iron etc from the impurities in it but what's the ruling on someone who comes from overseas pays a lot of money difficult to get a visa someone who came from india or from japan or from europe and it's not easy for him to come frequently maybe once every five to ten years and he would like to perform umrah for his loved ones his deceased father his deceased grandmother his siblings etc who could not make it in this case there is no problem inshallah in performing multiple umrahs while following the right process which is performing umrah then cutting short your hair you wear your new haram go to masjid at 10 am or masjid or to the area of the hill make your haram from there and come and make another umbra due to the difficulty of performing it uh regularly but those like us who live within the vicinity of the haram or nearby or can frequently come every month they should only perform more muhammad and one umrah and allah azza knows best you"
