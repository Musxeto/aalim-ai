  "transcript": "the second question is is it permissible to consume shellac i hope he's not the jew in shakespeare play uh the immersion of venice uh is it permissive to consume shellac um it's uh the secretion of lac bug but bits of the bug itself can come into it when processing shellac is usually you used in sweets first of all the conspiracy theory the rumors the allegations do not play into islam and to is our islamic belief so many people say oh toothpaste contains pork pepsi contains pork coffee is made of haram this that the bones of the dead is used in this and that and they make in making sugar they make everything haram the rule of thumb everything is halal by default until proven otherwise so such rumors and claims are baseless secondly it is not permissible to consume insects at all to buy them let alone their secretion i hope i'm pronouncing it good let alone their droppings but if it is under gone if it was to undergo a vigorous process of changing its physical and chemical characteristics like in the case of gelatin or glycerin in this case it becomes a new substance and this new substance is not related to the old one and hence it becomes halal so by default all sweets are halal until proven otherwise and if we are certain that it contains such ingredients then if it went through this process of changing it from such a specific substance into another substance in this case it becomes halal insha knows best you"
