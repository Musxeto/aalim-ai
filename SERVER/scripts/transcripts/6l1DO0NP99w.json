Mashallah Please, I don't argue about something if somebody make a question about my prayers until I have a clear evidence which back in my argument before so I want to know if two men are praying and one is leading as Imam what is the standing position of these two people? They should stand shoulder to shoulder whenever two men are praying alone they have to stand shoulder to shoulder the Imam should not be a little bit ahead of the follower they should stand side by side and Allah knows best"
