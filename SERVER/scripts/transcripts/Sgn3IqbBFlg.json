  "transcript": "Noor from Japan. Hi Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. I want to ask you about how can we help our brothers and sisters in Gaza, in Palestine. We have answered this Akhi so many times and we said that as individuals we have no ability to do anything for them except a lot and a lot of du'a. In our daily lives, in our tahajjud, in our fard prayers, we do a lot of du'a. Also, we expose the enemies of Islam and the enemies of humanity on all social media platforms possible so that we would expose their inhumanity to the whole world. Not only in that country but also those hypocrites who assist them and they say that we are against civilians being killed yet we ship them the bombs ourselves. Also, if there is a possibility of supporting their cause and plight by sending them aid, by sending them food, by sending them medicine, we should do our level best and may Allah Azawajal make them prevail and succeed over their enemies."
