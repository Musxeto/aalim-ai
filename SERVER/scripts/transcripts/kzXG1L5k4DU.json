  "title": "Barber Giving Qaza Haircuts Haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdurrahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh I had a question regarding giving haircuts because I was thinking about maybe doing barbering as a side thing but let's say somebody asks you to do say like a makruh haircut or a haram haircut such as trimming the beard or maybe shaving the beard or doing qaza but you know would that be collaborating upon evil? What do you think, what do you think Abdurrahman? I'm sorry? What do you think? I think it's probably not you know permissible but you know in America that's like all they ask for yeah but but again in America liquor selling is permissible in some states medical marijuana or marijuana for entertainment is permissible so the ayah in chapter 5 in the very beginning Surah Al-Ma'idah where Allah says and collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon sin and vice this is crystal clear that anything that facilitates haram you must not be involved in it so someone stops you at this at the street and say Assalamu Alaikum Akhi, how are you doing? listen I'm I was asking where is the brothel or where is this XYZ bar or a strip club and you say well take the second right it's on your left this is definitely sinful and you'll get the same sins of this individual because you've collaborated with him on sin and vice likewise when they ask you to trim their beard or shave it or have a haram haircut it's the same thing likewise when a woman does Hinnah artist and she decorates a woman's hands or face or body and she knows that she doesn't wear the hijab she's as sinful as that and it so goes on and Allah knows best"
