  "transcript": "Those who want to take the Sunnah out of Islam,   they say we only go to the Quran, this \nis the only thing that we act upon,   and we say to them what do we do with this ayah, \nAllah says “Refer it to Allah”. How do we refer   things to Allah, to the Quran. Any person would \nknow this. How do we refer to the Prophet ﷺ. This is his Sunnah, this is his teachings, \nso this is the role of the Sunnah it is   to explain, to complement the Quran. Allah \nsays \"And we [that is Allah] revealed to you Oh   Muhammad ﷺ we reveal to you the Sunnah that you \nmay make clear to the people what was sent down   to them, [What was sent down to them, the \nQuran.] And that they might give thought\".   What clearer verses do you require Oh who \nyou claim that you only abide and praise   and glorify the Quran and refuse to believe \nin anything else what this is the Quran,   when you reject such Ayahs that Allah clearly \ntells us that the Sunnah is there to explain to   you what was sent to you which is the Quran when \nyou reject this ayah you reject the whole Quran   you cannot understand the Quran without the \nSunnah, so the Quran is in more need to the   Sunnah than the Sunnah is in more need to \nthe Quran. And this was what Imam Al-Uzza'i   said may Allah have mercy on his soul the Quran is \na holistic book if there was no need for it to be   explained, there was no need for the message of \nthe Prophet ﷺ, Allah would have revealed a Quran   for each of us to read and interpret by their own \nheads, and this is not applicable, this can't be,   you come to ayahs in the Quran, we call it \nin Arabic, Mujmal, it's a holistic word,   but you can't understand it without going \ninto explanations of it, and you require this,   so a holistic ayah says such as establish \nprayer, everybody understands what prayer is   but what is meant by prayer actually in Islam. How \nmany times are we to pray, mentioned in the Quran? Fajr, Zhuhr, Asr, Maghreb, and Isha, are \nthey mentioned in the Quran specifically?   Are they mentioned that Fajr is two, Maghreb \nis three, Zhuhr, Asr, and Isha are four rak'as? And each rak'ah, each unit is composed of two \nprostrations why not one, is this mentioned in the   Quran? The answer is no, so if it's not mentioned \nin the Quran, how are we to know how to pray? This is Mujmal, this is ambiguous that needs to be \nclarified and explained in details by the Sunnah.   When Allah Azza Wa Jal says prohibited to you are \nthe dead animals, the blood, the flesh of swines. I understand from this ayah that any dead animal \nthat was not slaughtered would be Haram, is this   a valid understanding? Well when we go to the \nSunnah we find that the Prophet ﷺ mentioned to   us that there are two types of dead animals that \nwere permitted for us, the locust and the fish.   And there are two types of blood that were \npermitted for us, the liver and the spleen,   so would this be a contradiction? No   see the Sunnah either coincides 100% with the \nQuran or it brings something that explains   what is in the Quran, so it gives us details of \nwhat in the Quran as in the case of the prayers,   or it brings something new altogether \nthat the Quran does not go against,   so it's something new not found in the Quran, \nbut the Quran doesn't prohibit, as in the case of   combining the marriage of a woman and \nher aunt or a woman and her niece.   This is prohibited from the \nSunnah, all scholars know of this,   it's not mentioned in the Quran, the Quran only \nprohibits combining between two sisters, but   does the Quran say it is not prohibited, no, it \ndoesn't comment on it, so the Sunnah adds value."
