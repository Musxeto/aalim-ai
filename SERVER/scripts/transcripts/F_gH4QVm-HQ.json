  "transcript": "so I have from India I calculated and let's say for example it is 200 I give it up I give it a four percent I saw in Islam q a that the amount of Dhaka which should be given to poor and needy should surprise him for whole one year so if I give that poor person more than 200 dollars then that will exceed 2.5 percent calculations so is it permissible to give that poor person only 2.5 the things you heard in Islam q a was referring to what suffices a poor person for a whole year so if I were to be poor and what suffices me and my family throughout the whole year is a thousand dollars you can give me a thousand dollars or less but if you said oh I'll give the Sheikh ten thousand dollars so that I would help him start to build a house no this is not allowed this is too much you're exceeding the need of the poor and those who say I have a relative my uncle is poor so I'm giving him fifty thousand dollars to build the house wait wait this is not permissible from the zakat this is not permissible this is an Overkill you can give him what is sufficient to maintain his livelihood for a whole year paying his rent giving him food for a whole year not to make him Wealthy by giving him fifty thousand dollars to build a house now he's wealthy so this is not permissible so your understanding is wrong 250 dollars is good Azure zakat you don't have to give him more to suffice for a whole year no this is yours a cat you give it if you want to give some more no problem but if your zakatist twenty thousand dollars and he only needs three thousand dollars a year you can't give him five thousand dollars the the second is twenty thousand you can't give him five because this is over what he needs for a whole year and I hope this makes sense foreign [Music] have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign"
