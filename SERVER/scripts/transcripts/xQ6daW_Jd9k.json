  "title": "Can a daughter give a bath to her elderly father? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Umm Adhan says, can a daughter give a bath to her elderly father who needs help? She does not have any males who can help and she wants to serve her father and be a dutiful child. In Islam, it is prohibited to look or touch the awrah of another other than your own spouse. So, a man cannot touch or look at a awrah of another man. A woman cannot touch and look at a awrah of another woman. And it's even worse if it's the opposite genders. Now, this prohibition is a well-known fact in Islam. But when it comes to necessity, then such a prohibition may be removed. And we have a concession. For a doctor needs to examine his patients. And sometimes he may need to touch and look at a private part of his patient's body, whether male or female. But he may not transgress and exceed the limits. Having said that, if an elderly man needs assistance, whether in bathing or cleaning himself after answering the call of nature or changing diapers, and he's unable to do that alone. And there are no male in the house who could assist in that. And we cannot bring a male nurse to do that. In this case, a daughter or a daughter-in-law or a sister or one of those around can do such activities due to necessity, providing they're wearing gloves and they're not looking unless it's necessary. And that they do not touch or look at areas they are not supposed to look to or at. And hence, this would make life much easier and simpler, inshallah, for both of them. Thank you."
