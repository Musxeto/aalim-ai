  "transcript": "Ryan says what's the ruling on killing mosquitoes with electric rackets or other devices that electrocute the insects it's an issue of dispute in some messages you find this box with a velvet or blue or green light in it and every single couple of minutes you hear the the the electrocution and an insect dies something bigger or cetera some scholars say that this is prohibited because it is burning and we know that without any dispute without any doubt that the prophet alayhi salatu salam prohibited burning living creatures and he told us that this is a punishment only allowed by allah azza wajal even when i read me allah be pleased with him gathered those who worshipped him and he told them don't worship me i'm not allah and they kept on worshipping him so he threw them in fire and burnt them to death and they said this is the biggest sign that you are allah because no one torches with fire except allah and your torturing us and they died in their state of can cover even Abbas his cousin came to him and told him that this was prohibited and the Prophet as salam prohibited killing people with fire and he regretted this Ali may Allah be pleased with him and he created this because he did not know at the time or maybe he forgot the ruling so some scholars say that this is Haram the other type of scholars said electrocution is not burning it is a shock that it induces and leads to the death of an individual so it's not like putting someone under the torch and torturing him and burning him and he's feeling the pain and the agony etc no electrocution is on the spot he's dead and this is the most authentic opinion that electrocuting insects in this fashion killing them instantly this is halal and there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
