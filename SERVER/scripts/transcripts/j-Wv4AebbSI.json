  "title": "Allah created us in pairs, what about those who die SINGLE? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh Ahmed says Allah has said that we have created \nyou in pairs what about so many people who die   single this is a misconception that a lot of \nthe Muslims have Allah says in Surat Al-Zariyat from everything we've created to we created a pair \nso that you may remember so people think that this   is referring to spouses so every individual must \nhave a spouse and this is not what is meant by the   Ayah because there are so many people who \nare born and they die without getting married   or they die before reaching the age of \npuberty so where is his or her spouse the   Ayah refers to creating from each \nthing a pair so there is night and day   there is heat and cold there is good and \nevil and there is male and female now you   come and say oh but there is a transgender or \na third gender or a transvestor or whatever   this is not logical and not Islamic and not \nChristian and not Jewish another single religion   endorses this this is all the fabrication of \ntoday's atheists and those who want to change   the world order and to insert immorality among \nthe people and this would take people downhill   it would destroy them Allah says in the Quran \nthey're created of a pair male and female that   is it and this was mentioned in all previous \nreligions before Islam so there's no way   they can argue this so this is what is meant \nthat of each thing there's an opposite to it   so Heat there is a cold cold things cannot be \nHot and Hot things cannot be cold and this is   a manifestation of Allah's greatness when he can \ncreate things others can't and Allah Knows Best"
