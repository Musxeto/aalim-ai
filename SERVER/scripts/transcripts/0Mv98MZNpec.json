  "transcript": "Daniyal from Norway Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu May I address you Sheikh? And you as well I had a question about I was watching one of your fatwas about wearing perfume and how it's one of the three things you shouldn't reject and I was wondering if you could give some context onto the other two things that weren't mentioned there that are also things you shouldn't reject when offered The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said in an authentic hadith that there are three things that should not be rejected perfume, cushions, and milk if I'm not yes and milk if I am not mistaken or forgetting these things are very easy to accept very friendly to offer and they're beneficial who hates to have a good perfume presented to him who hates a good cushion to be given to him when he's sitting so that he would incline on it and rest who hates a drink of milk which is the mother of all types of nutritions and food and one of the best if not the best thing to consume as per the hadith everything the Prophet Alayhi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam used to drink or eat he used to ask Allah Azza wa Jal he used to show his gratitude and thank Allah and praise him for it and ask barakah and blessing except milk he used to praise Allah and thank Allah and show his gratitude and ask Allah for more just milk so again these are the three things that it is highly recommended to accept and not to reject so that you don't break other people's hearts and Allah knows best"
