  "transcript": "[Music] ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam [Music] mashallah it's nice to see these faces that perform W every day for the sake of Allah announcing their coming here early at 9:00 which is past my bedtime but it's good it's good alhamdulillah to see them and try to put them to sleep in this 40 minutes in allel there is a terrifying Hadith beautiful but terrifying that muaah may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam once said the people of the scriptures before you were divided into 72 sects all of them are in Hell except one and your umah this millah this religion of Islam they will divide into 73 sects All In Hell except one the companion said which one so that we can join them so that we can be with them the prophet said it's the main body Al in another narration it is those who follow my footsteps and the footsteps of the companions may Allah be pleased with them when you look at this Hadith and you see that we have two billion Muslims and you try to analyze why are we being so defeated humiliated looked down upon you realize that the two billion Muslims have divided into 73 sects now who among these sects is upon the footsteps of Muhammad sallallah alai wasallam and his companions why have they differed is it because one is Hani one is Maliki one is shaf and one is h no these are differences whether you put your hand here you put your hand here you don't put your hands at all in Salat it's a issue doesn't qualify you to go to hell so what is the problem the problem is in these 72 sects entered Hellfire because their deviation in so what is because if knowing AA means that you will enter Paradise this is your call or belief without it there is no Paradise how many of the 72 sects pray fast make Om do H give zakat and maybe pray night prayer but they are in hell I pray to Allah that me and you are not among them wall it's a big problem to live all these years believing in the wrong beliefs and ending up in Hellfire it's a tragedy so what is a a is the firm belief in Allah in his angels in his scriptures in his Messengers in the day of judgment and in the pre Destiny or the Divine decree whether good or bad it's the belief your a in the truth that was mentioned to us in the Quran and in the prophet's teaching which constitute the fundamentals of Islam and anything of the Unseen that Allah tells us about we believe this is your AA now the people of innovation the Deviant sects hate the word AA and specifically they hate the word anywhere in the world you go and say they would label you wahabi your salafi you're this I didn't say anything said is mentioned in the Sunnah of the Prophet wasam they feel that it goes against their deviant belief because when you say you follow the way of the Prophet you believe in the Quran and this is what they hate the most may Allah be pleased with him says the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said and this Hadith is classified as the highest in authenticity it is mut all the hadiths that speak about the pool of the Prophet they are the highest in authenticity so the prophet said I will reach the pool ahead of you so the first one to reach the pool what is the it's the Glad Tiding from Allah it's the river it's the pool where if you were to ever drink from it you will never become thirsty I am the first one to reach ahead of you to the pool he who comes to me will drink and whoever drinks will never thirst again make us among those who drink from that pool and whoever drinks will never thirst again there will come to me some people whom I will recognize and they will recognize me I know them they know me we look alike they look like from my umah I can recognize them then they will be prevented from reaching me they will be prevented from drinking from the pool they will be stopped by the Angels so I say and object they are from me but it will be be said to me you do not know what they introduced after you were gone so then I shall say away away with those who changed the religion after I was gone Ya Allah look at those deviant sects look at these people who think they're worshiping Allah how deviated they are they will be rejected on the day of judgment from the prophets and the prophet would say away away the prophet doesn't have want to do anything with them so the most beautiful word is something that the Deviant sects reject what kind of deviant sects all deviant sects if you look at the Shia they reject if you look at the grave worshippers they hate it when you say those who swirl and saying Allah what are you doing mentioning Allah this is my GMC car when I used to start this I change the Mufflers same masallah this is said no this is our your is this and that Subhan Allah what was the of the Prophet remembering Allah worshiping Allah revering Allah alone no hidden agendas no politics no getting people's money like M's want it's only directing people to Allah I don't want anything from you this is the message of the messengers I don't want anything from you just to guide you to Jenna and to be able to go with you to jenah the people of deviant don't want this because they want your belief corrupted and this is why Allah says in the Quran and when Allah is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with a verion but when those worshiped other than him are mentioned immediately they Rejoice they're happy but we Muslims we're happy only by the mentioning and the rembrance of Allah so what ised you knowed I will not go and reinvent the wheel but I will highlight few things that may benefit us inshallah and help us why everyone around us knows what is in five minutes we're done the implementation takes ages it doesn't take a week a month a year it take ages how many years did the prophet spend in mekah correct how many ah 13 yes 13 years in meccah there was no fasting it was obligated in Medina there was no zakat there was no Hajj and omah there was no prayer except in the last three years two years one year mandatory the voluntary it was okay so 13 years what was the prophet doing in mecah teaching people 5 minutes and that's it this is what he was doing he was implanting in their hearts the real the real how to reveal the Quran and to believe in it how how to believe in the six pillars of Iman how to know Allah's beautiful names and attributes how to honor the prophet Muhammad and to love him more than we love our own selves and wives and children how to know the reality of this dun which is soon to be over and everybody comes when is the day of judgment answer when you die yeah yes yes is that close yes why do you look at centuries from now your day of judgment is when you die when are you going to die Allah I've heard that Prophet no lived 950 years maybe 800 years you're going to die soon you never know when you're going to die time is elapsing quick but you don't know it you're so engaged in dun the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam spent 13 years in meca teaching people the reality of this is the true so we know to worship Allah of lordship to worship Allah by his attributes and actions so he is The Giver of life and death he is the owner he's the Creator do you know one single individual in this universe whoever came up and said I am the Creator go to the Christians in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost blah blah okay father we know son Holy Ghost any of them create no go to the Hindus how many gods you have 16,000 plus give or take a thousand mashallah any of them creates no no one dares and says I create except Allah but people don't know people don't acknowledge it's the the easiest fact of life that Allah is the creator he is The Giver of life and death he is the facilitator he is the provider he is subel who owns the whole universe this is is to worship Allah with our actions so we don't worship anyone else we don't devote any of our worship to other than Allah so to him we pray to him we fast to him we invoke and supplicate to him we fear to him we hope to him we love to him we have trust andul and the whole list goes on all of this is only limited to Allah this is theed of worship then there is that beautiful of when you worship Allah by what he described himself and his messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam described him by so his beautiful names are a set and his attributes are a set you know those and you affirm what Allah affirmed to himself so Allah says that he's all hearing Allah is all hearing this is an this is a name the attribute the hearing he is all seeing the attribute and when Allah tells us that he has a face when Allah tells us that he has a hand we believe in that without discussion this is what Allah said in the Quran the Quran is the Cornerstone of your belief the Deviant people come and say no no no no no no you don't understand Allah says he has a face but he doesn't have a face are you crazy so no no this is a metaphor Allah has a hand no no no this is not true because uh this is power Allah says to Satan why didn't you prostrate to what I created with my hand in Sur with my two hands they said Okay Hand is power but two hands in Arabic even it doesn't fit uh yeah it's power It's ability it's whatever Shan could have said duh you created with me also with your two hands if it was power but it wasn't it was Allah's hands we don't reinvent the wheel this is what the Quran says this is what the prophet Muhammad saidham they come and say no no no no no you misunderstand this it's all metaphor and what about heaven and hell it's also a metaphor and what about this life it's a metaphor then if I kill you it's a metaphor might as well yeah these guys are crazy we Muslims are the happiest people on Earth because we follow Quran and Sunnah we have no ambiguity we have no issues with that Allah combined the three types ofed in one Ayah imagine theed of worship lordship and beautiful names and attributes one Ayah Allah says in the Quran [Music] Allah says lord of the heavens and the Earth and all that is between them this is lordship so worship him alone and be consistent and patient in his worship be constant and uh uh um uh patient in his worship this is of worship Allah then says do you know of anyone who is similar to him and this is now this is the mission and vision of all prophets and messengers of Allah what are the positive impacts of this belief that we get from the Quran on a muslim's life we could go to when we want to speak about the essence and the reality of people don't speak usually about these things because they want stories they want funny jokes they want something that is refreshing and entertaining this is your life on Earth if you comprehend it and implement it you will become the the happiest man on Earth or woman so you have to understand the reality of your belief of your conviction of your in order to find the sweetness of whatever you're doing if you implement it well you get to know Allah and this is the most important piece of Science and knowledge on Earth science of nuclear weapons is good because it gives you power science of making money is good because it makes you rich science of medicine is good because it heals people but science of Allah and knowing his names and attributes nothing can surpass this this is why when we say allahar we think of everything other than Allah we are a big failure big zero yeah whenever I forgot where I put my keys I just go into prayer I remember everything and the problem is you ask the Muslims how many names does Allah have to 99 mashallah good BOS and then you tell them how many names of these 99 names you know they look down and say um 10 said okay from these 10 names how many names do you know the meaning of whoops maybe one or two do you fear Allah how do you want to find the sweetness of Salat if you don't know the meaning of Allah how many verses of the Quran do you memorize I memorize five suras what are they what is the meaning of huh you read this Surah every day hundreds of times what's the meaning of a this is the name of Allah yes Allah never thought of it you know Manchester United's latest player coming to join them how much he's getting paid and you don't know the names of Allah and then you are proud the is saying oh I'm a Muslim I'm a Muslim show me this is a big problem that we have so shows you who Allah is and when you have Allah you're the strongest man or woman Well Woman strongest man on Earth inshallah number two when you haveed you have humility you have modesty you are humble why you would never find someone who with real arrogant looking down at people you're white you're black you're yellow you're red you're from this country you're from that country I am this I am that never a real Muslim with with will always be humble like the prophet the most humble person ever to walk the earth because a person withed acknowledges that I am weak I'm vulnerable I am poor I am in need for Allah look at the business men unfortunately we used to be in the corporate world so whenever we talk about our achievements in the annual meeting with the board we say and I managed to fulfill the targets of my plan for 202 in the first quarter and in the second quarter I will do this I will do that you you do nothing it is Allah but you're failing to attribute every success you're going through to Allah and this is a breach of your a is corrupt anything that happens good to you you attribute it to Allah any favor and blessing that you enjoy this is from Allah but we don't have proper and this is why a true true a person with he feels strong yet humble I feel strong because Allah is watching my back Allah is protecting me Allah is defending me nobody can harm me this is why I get my strength not from my wealth not from my connections and who you know not from my citizenship or from my country I get my power only from Allah the people's look how they see life is all materialistic I evalue I actually evaluate You by hm what kind of phone Samsung or iPhone Samsung I have both so don't don't I so you wouldn't be able to look down at me uh what kind of car you have oh poren masah it's not my she it's my wife okay I understand what house do you live in how much do you have credit cards how what is your watch Patrick Philip this is not life your true value is what is in your heart your AA how you're committed to your religion how practicing you are the amount of knowledge the amount of how radiant you give and and goodness to the others this is your true value people are only interested in music movies Netflix things that entertain them and make them happy Allah says to them one verse if we read it with our hearts it will terrifies US Allah says then did you think that we created you uselessly and that to us you would not be returned are you crazy do you think Allah created all of this so that you can have fun have children enjoy life party go and get wasted cheat people bribe people get more money become more influencer and then when you die game over alhamdulillah no it's not game over the game has just started every single moment in of your life on this Earth You Will be held accountable for every single moment Ya Allah I have done very bad things in my life you will be held accountable so unless you repent and ask Allah for for forgiveness and do good deeds and have certainty in what Allah has for you you're doomed my friend and look at the vast majority of Muslims today repeating but it has no impact on their lives why because they just say it they do not mean it look at their homes filled with statues filled with entertainment filled with everything that is Haram look at how they deal in their business and selling and buying cheating bribing lying Etc look how they treat with their spouses betrayal deceit arrogance look how they treat with even Muslims in the Masjid when they're standing next to them also they have big problems in this where is in their life where is their it's gone it's just something we say but we do not walk the talk the time is up by seven we have seven minutes and I have a lot of material unfortunately but inshallah we will try our our level best among the positive impact of to is that you know that you're here not to have children children and to enjoy a big house and to live as if you're never going to die you're here to worship Allah worshiping Allah is not sitting in the Masjid allahar allahar allahar no this is not only worshiping Allah this is part of it worshiping Allah is being good with the Muslims and the non-muslims is being kind is being truthful is being honest is being productive proactive going to the gym is part of you being a good Muslim to have a good good body participating in social events for your family and your relatives and kinship giving the poor feeding the orphans all of this in totality even going to work in your company building business becoming rich in halal ways is worshiping Allah and Allah created us to worship Him does Allah need us yes or no Allah doesn't need us W Allah Allah doesn't need us Allah says oh mankind you are those in need of Allah while Allah is free of need and praiseworthy you are the one who needs Allah Allah doesn't need you so any form of worship without is like praying without W erases your sins so when you come on the day of judgment yes we have flows we have shortcomings we but I have strong toed in my heart I've lived upon it I've died upon it and I'll be resurrected upon it Allah will erase your sins with his grace and will and the first thing you will you will be asked upon in your grave how much is your bank account nope do you have a golden Visa nope what's the first thing you will be asked 10 minutes I can't read English good in Arabic please so uh what is the first thing you're going to be asked about in your grave three questions who's your lord what is your religion what is this man or who's this man who was sent to you Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam three questions everyone says oh that's easy I can answer it la wah you can't W you cannot unless you walk the talk many Muslims I get in counseling sessions coming to me terrified say I believe in I believe and I pray and I do but I'm not certain Allah exists what should I do I said nothing you going to hell she no I want to go to paradise said no you going to hell believe me trust me if you don't have [Music] City if you don't have certainity you're in Hell there is a difference between Whispers that come and go oh um Quran and they go alhamdulillah I'm a straight Muslim but when you come and sit and contemplate maybe it was all accident maybe the Big Bang happened by itself maybe maybe you are adopted son of your mom she's not your biological mother how do you dare say such a thing maybe maybe put it in the dust pin yeah certainity you see all this universe who made this Allah she how can you prove this how can I prove this I'll bring all the electronics gadgets transistors and I put them in a box for a thousand year hoping that they will become an iPhone will they yes or no it has to have a Creator look at look look at us yeah there is nothing that anyone with sense and common knowledge would defy and say there is no existence of Allah you have to have y but if you don't have y you will not be able to answer the questions my Lord is Allah my religion is Islam and my messenger is Muhammed and theed without it you will never enter Jenna it's the key Allah says in the Quran indeed he who Associates others with Allah Allah has for forbidden him paradise and his Refuge is the fire how many of the Muslims you know go to soothsayers to magicians how many go to Future tellers to tell them about the future how many go to people who would read their zodiac and these you know torat cards or I don't know what they call them and they think that they can expl these are not Muslims even if they pray 10 times a day they've breached their Islam and committed shik and major shik is what makes you happy and this is all found in the Quran the Cornerstone of the belief of the M how how would you like to be happy oh she I'd like to take a second wife don't I tried it and it didn't work look at me ah so okay she I'd like to do this I'd like to do that you want to be happy listen listen to this Ayah Allah says whoever does righteousness whether male or female while he's a Believer while he's a mmin okay what will happen we will surely cause him to live a good life and we will surely give them their reward in the Hereafter according to the best of what they used to do in this life you will good get a good life and before I used to say a good wife is a good life and this is totally true I tried to use it with a husband a good husband it didn't work so actually to have a good life in this Dunya is not to be rich only is not to be powerful or with authority or strong it is here content when you have content in your heart you have a good life so if you worship Allah you pray F on time you pray all your prayers as mandated you stay away from Haram W if you have billions or you don't have anything you will always be content the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam how was he the richest man on earth no he would not eat barley bread continuously for three days barley who eats barley nobody we only eat wheat so the prophet would not be full of barley bread for three consecutive days and yet he was the most content person on Earth he lost six of his children in his lifetime while he was alive he Allah he Allah bless him with seven six died in his life how would you feel if you lose one child devastated why me why me why not him why not him the prophet lost six in his life only Fatima may Allah be pleased with her outlived him and he told her you will live after me six months and he will die as well how was he content so my time is up but my last word would be go to the Quran read it not for Baraka it is a Baraka read it as an instruction book what does Allah want from me okay I will establish Salat and I will give zakat stay away from Haram I will stay away from Haram it fixes your implement it and this is your core belief that will lead you to I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those who hear the best of rhetoric and they would follow it so that it would lead them to and those who have slept you can wake up again"
