  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Canada what does it mean to be \nwhat exactly does it mean to be content with the   decree of Allah okay during summer time go ahead \nyes oh yeah during summer time I would usually   get like really hot and uncomfortable and you \nknow like I don't feel okay and stuff I don't   really like it and sometimes I don't know \nmy head just starts hurting and I get angry   and I don't really I'm not sure if this is \nbeing like discontent with Allah's decree content with the decree of Allah is \nan inner feeling that you know you   had nothing to do with it and this is Allah's \ntest upon you a person gets into a car crash   loses the ability to walk he's paralyzed this is \na catastrophe this is a hardship that rarely you   would find people being able to tolerate and \nthe trauma is huge a True Believer is saddened   he May Cry and weep he may feel a bit depressed \nbut he's content and he doesn't say anything   that angers Allah when the prophet (Peace and \nBlessings be Upon Him) lost his long awaited   child his own awaited son some say he died of \nthe age of two years and the prophet (Peace and   Blessings be Upon Him) was approximately in his \n60s and he had no male offspring living and we all   know that you need an heir to carry your name and \nto carry your legacy so he was looking forward to   this boy and all of a sudden he died this was a \ngreat loss in any man's life whether a boy or a   girl but in the case of the prophet (Peace and \nBlessings be Upon Him) he already lost two boys   so that was a Calamity what did the prophet \ndo (Peace and Blessings be Upon Him)   he said the heart is saddened and the eyes are \ntearing and we say nothing that displeases Allah   azzawajal and by Allah upon departing and \nleaving you Ibrahim we are sad that's it   compare this to the discontent another person \nwould do by banging their heads in the wall by   tearing their clothes by crying and shouting why \nme why not them what did I do to you I did all   what you wanted to be to do I prayed five \ntimes a day I did you always do this to me the guy lost it he flunked his test so \nwhen it's hot you have nothing to do   in being in such an environment or weather turn \non the air conditioning it's not working Sheikh   this is your test from Allah are you frustrated \nyes no problem what counts is what actions you're   going to take and the things that are coming \nfrom your mouth if you keep on bitching and   whining with excuse my French and saying every \ntime someone asks you how are things oh yeah   it's hot it's like hell I don't know why we're \nliving like this nobody's doing anything about   it I can't even breathe I'm sweating like a \npig what are you doing this is not definitely   the right thing to do being content is saying \nwallah it's hot alhamdulillah I can't complain   this is something Allah is testing me with so I \nhope this answers your question brother Faisal"
