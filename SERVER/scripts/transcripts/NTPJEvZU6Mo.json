  "transcript": "satya says is it sunnah for all the family members to eat from a single plate the Sunnah of the Prophet Ali salat WA Salam when he heard the complaint of his companion saying o prophet of Allah we traveled together and when food time comes it's not sufficient we are always hungry so the Prophet said maybe you are eating in isolation each one of you is eating alone they said yes said no don't do that gather on the food say bismillah and eat from one plate this is the Sunnah so most people do this nowadays people are a little bit fancier so they tend to have their own plates and put the food in it there is no problem in that I personally prefer to eat from the same plate the big plate that we are all sharing in seeking the Baraka the blessing of Allah Azza WA JAL so should we do it on the table or put it on the floor the Sunnah and the easiest is to eat on the floor the Prophet SM had never eaten on a table he always ate on the floor I always eat on the floor I enjoy this because it's a Sunnah and you feel comfy you feel easygoing rather than eating on a table and then you may fall down subhanAllah but if someone says yes but I'm used to eating on the table sitting on a chair no problem it's the sky's the limit go ahead there's nothing wrong in that at all [Music]"
