  "transcript": "Fahad from Sweden. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. I have a question regarding ghusl Sheikh. During ghusl, is ghusl sufficient before I pray or do I have to make wudu after ghusl? Is it to uplift janabah or to cool down and to clean your body? Just clean, just normal clean. No, this does not suffice. When you perform a normal shower, whether to clean your body after hitting the gym or to cool off when it's hot, you, after washing all of your body part, did not fulfill the six pillars of wudu. And these six pillars are washing the face, washing the arms till the elbows, wiping over the head and the ears, washing the feet till the ankles, to be simultaneous and to follow the order 1, 2, 3, 4. When you don't follow the order because you just took a shower and came out, this does not fulfill the job and you're not in the state of wudu. How is this different to when I intend to uplift a major ritual impurity which is janabah? Ah, this is different. Because uplifting the major sexual impurity or ritual impurity is something major. By uplifting it while doing ghusl, the minor ritual impurity would be uplifted as well. Exactly as when we come to the masjid and we pray two rak'ahs of sunnatul fajr. Do I have to stand up again and pray two rak'ahs tahiyyatul masjid? The answer is no. Because these two rak'ahs already were inserted in the previous ones and Allah knows best."
