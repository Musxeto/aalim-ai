  "transcript": "Ameen from Morocco Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh so often in night when I enter the mosque I haven't yet prayed the Salat Maghreb so I just want to ask that should I pray the Tahiyyat, the two Rakaats or should I pray Maghreb directly? Jazak Allah Khair Are you praying with the congregation or alone? No no when I entered the mosque they still didn't pray the Isha, there is time before Isha. Oh okay so you want to you late for Maghreb the answer is the answer of course you start with the Fard and this suffices you from Tahiyyat Al-Masjid so you go directly and pray Maghreb and you don't have to pray Tahiyyat Al-Masjid because Maghreb is bigger than the Tahiyyat Al-Masjid and takes its place"
