  "transcript": "from nigeria he says i went to the masjid no one was there i gave the adhan i offered my voluntary prayers and then give iqamah and prayed on my own and nobody joined would i be rewarded as a as if i have prayed with the congregation the answer is yes there's an authentic hadith where the prophet says haslam whoever performs wudu but he's late in attending the prayer in the masjid for a legitimate reason and he goes through the masjid and no one is there and he prays he will be rewarded as if he prayed with the congregation so alhamdulillah you will be rewarded for that and this is a favor and blessing from allah the almighty"
