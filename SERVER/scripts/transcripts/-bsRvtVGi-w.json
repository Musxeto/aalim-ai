  "title": "Garments below the Ankles Hadith, What if you are not wearing it out of arrogance?",
  "transcript": "second and the second question is uh about the garment below the ankle some people say talk about one heavies and some people say well the second of these does mention arrogance so if you're not doing it out of elegance then you can read it so what's your what's your view on that okay i will answer inshallah now the second question is very common one the issue of wearing the garments below the ankles there are a number of hadiths those who say that it is permissible without arrogance referred to a hadith neglecting the general hadiths and the scholars methodology of dealing with these hadiths is not by picking and choosing rather by implying and implementing and combining all these hadees to understand them you cannot come to one verse of the quran that talks about whoever is surrounded by his sin then he will abide in hell forever and eternity and overlook the other ayat and verses because this is what the khawaris do and hopefully you're not from them so how to look at it scholars had explained that they said that there are two categories two types of sins one a sin that involves arrogance two a sin that does not involve arrogance so the one that involves arrogance includes a number of torments and punishments and the one that does not have arrogance has only one punishment so if i drag my clothes below my ankle without arrogance i'm just neglectful the prophet said allah that the punishment of the area covered from your ankle to the ground is in hellfire so if it's this much it's this much if this much it's this much if this much this much that's it and we have from the sunnah hadiths where certain organs and limbs are being punished not the whole body as in the hadith of abu talib the prophet said that the least person punished in hell fire is a person where two fire stones are put in his shoes or sandals from their heat his his brain boils so it's only that area that is tormented but look what happened to the whole body accordingly without arrogance this is going to be punished what about if a person does it with arrogance we have a hadith that says four types of people there are three types of people that allah does not look at them does not purify them that does not speak to them and allah would punish them severely on the day of judgment one of them is the one who drags his garment so the scholar said ah this one drags his garment the other one also dragged his garment what's the difference the other hadith that stated that while a man was dragging his garment walking in arrogance allah made the earth has have a downfall or an um to be opened and swallow it and he's falling throughout the whole earth to the seventh earth ah this one includes arrogance and in another hadith allah does not look at a man who drags his clothes out of arrogance ah this one is a with arrogance as well so you see that there are classifications and the hadith of abu bakr which a lot of the people say when the prophet said this about dragging the garments below the ankles abubakar said o prophet of allah i'm a skinny man and my garment i tie it as much as possible to my waist but because i'm sinning it keeps on falling so it may fall under or below the ankles so the prophet gave him a declaration allah he said you are not one of them don't worry so people say okay i too do this not out of adding and says no no no you don't or you cannot afford such a permission from the prophet sallam if you have one i would say be my guest but you don't therefore this is an exception for abu bakr because the prophet knows what is in his heart through allah's informing him and i hope this answers your question you"
