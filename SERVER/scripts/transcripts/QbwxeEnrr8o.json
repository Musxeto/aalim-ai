  "transcript": "Manesh says is it permissible to take advantage of sales on kaffir holidays are we sinful if we do and is this considered as partaking in their festival and in their festivals first of all this depends on which end you are in so if you are the merchant if you are the business person who is selling and making profit out of it we say that this is not permissible making advertisement on Christmas or New Year's Eve or Black Friday or whatever they call it and try to sell with discounts because of the holiday seasons and making profit out of this as a merchant this is not permissible for you because this is part of celebrating the holidays their holidays the kafir' holidays while if you were the customer who goes and takes advantage of something that is 40% cheaper than usual without having any intention to celebrate or to glorify the season there is nothing wrong in that therefore you have to look at what end you are in if you are the one selling this means that you're going to advertise you're going to do some marketing you're going to give a special discount for this occasion this is not permissible if you are the one who's buying there's nothing wrong in that insha Allah who azza wajal"
