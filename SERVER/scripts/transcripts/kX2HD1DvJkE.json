  "title": "Touched his mother with lust & desire, is his parents marriage BROKEN? (Hurmat MusƒÅharah)",
  "transcript": "a brother who wants to be anonymous he says if a person touches his mother with the desire and lust while she's sleeping and when he got to know about the ruling in hanafiq that his mother's and father's marriage will not be valid anymore should he go to his parents and tell them that their marriage is void unfortunately it seems that this issue is prevailing nowadays among a lot of the youth a lot of the Muslims and it is based on a concept known in some books of as hermit where the hanafi school of thought made it prohibited for a person once indulged in any Haram activity with a woman to get married to anyone else in her family that she is considered to be mahram too so for example if a person fornicates with a woman he cannot marry her daughter her sister her mother Etc now some blind followers of the hanafi Mata cascaded this a little bit further and said even if he looked at her touched her kissed her hugged her even if he did not go to third base if just done these things that would also prohibit it so this concept is not found in the vast majority of schools of thought because the logical thing is that a prohibited Act such as fornication does not make Halal things Haram so if someone committed Zina with a woman what does this have an impact on upon Him marrying her sister or even her daughter or her mother yes the fornication bit is Haram but this does not prohibit any further the the problem nowadays is that that this concept of has been cascaded by Layman by people of ignorance to the extent that they weren't really overboard with so nowadays I get people coming to me and saying to me that like this brother that when he was 15 years of age he used to look at his mother in a strange way and sometimes he may try to touch her or I would build that this is any unimaginable but some people are perverts some people when they are not equipped with proper Iman and when they're not abiding by the Quran the Sunnah while being exposed to a video clips songs movies uh soap operas where they see what provokes their desire and lust and don't have any place to express that other than what they find may Allah protect us and the Muslims so this man nowadays thinks that oh because I did this my mothers and fathers marriage is void is broken due to hermother which means that they are living in Haram and all their children that resulted from the this relationship are born out of wedlock and you get people coming to me saying that we have this vishwas I don't know how to act upon it and how to behave should I go and tell my parents and and this is baseless totally baseless not found in Islam altogether who in his right mind would come and say these couple's marriage is void why was it wrongfully done said no no no the guardian gave his daughter to this man in marriage and he accepted in the presence of two male Witnesses he gave the Dowry everything was Halal everything is fine okay they love one another they love one another they have children okay but the Man's father looked at his daughter-in-law in a lustful way and once he was drunk he tried to grope her he tried to do inappropriate things to her so now the marriage is void who said so why would we separate between two lawfully married couple who love one another because of a mistake that they had no hand in it doesn't make any sense what what religion States this Islam has nothing to do with that these are all forms of ignorance whether blind following imams or Scholars or whatever who don't know their heads from their feet and who just follow the books blindly without thinking whether it has traces of it in the Quran or the Sunnah or it does not so in a nutshell this concept of hermother does not exist it is bogus it is totally fabricated even if the father-in-law rapes his daughter protect us all hypothetically the guy is drunk the guy is nuts the guy is whatever why would I separate between a man and his wife because of the sin and mistake of a lunatic this is totally not true and not found thank you"
