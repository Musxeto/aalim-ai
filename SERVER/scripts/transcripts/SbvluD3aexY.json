  "transcript": "Dhafi from Indonesia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah When we are in Zakatul Maut or in the verge of death and say the Shahada, we are guaranteed Jannah. My question is, do you need to say the full sentence as in Ashadu an la ilaha illallah wa ashadu anna Muhammadur Rasulullah or we can cut it short to just la ilaha illallah? No, saying Ashadu an la ilaha illallah is sufficient for those who say it and they are Muslims because it is included. Wa ashadu anna Muhammadur Rasulullah is included in it. And at the time of the death, one is barely capable of saying this sentence if he's giving his last breath. So saying it alone is sufficient inshallah."
