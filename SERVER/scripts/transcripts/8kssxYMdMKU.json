  "title": "Husband & Wife learning Quran together from a male teacher  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he wants to learn the Koran and his wife from a teacher so is it permissible for a teacher to come and teach both of them at the same time this is not recommended and I believe that it is not permissible because this would mean that your wife would recite the Koran and beautify her voice and he would correct her and no don't say this don't say that and it would be sort of mixing though you are present but this is not permissible if you look inshallah you will find a woman that can come and teach her"
