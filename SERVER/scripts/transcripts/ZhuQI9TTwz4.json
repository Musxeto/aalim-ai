  "transcript": "[Music] um i i have a problem like um after for uh the fired prayer can i recite on the rukia after every prayer is this permissible i will answer inshallah and halima from france can we offer rookie after every fart is permissible the time you choose is important to be selected correctly if you do it ever after every fault this means that you think that it has certain benefits after fault prayer not only that people who see you would think that wiping their body after fart is a good thing and this is what's prevailing now in some of the messages when you find ignorant people or imbecile people washing themselves after prayer and thinking that this is from the sunnah which is not therefore if there is a need i have pain in my elbows tennis elbow whatever and i read the rookie and i wipe over it after salat or two salah it's okay but if i do it after every salat this becomes an innovation select any other time not related to a form of worship and allah azza knows best you"
