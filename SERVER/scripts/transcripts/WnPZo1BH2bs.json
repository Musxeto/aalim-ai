  "transcript": "says sheikh is it true that when someone dies we should not cry because the dead soul will feel pain people say if we cry that that person will feel that a mountain is kept on them first of all there is an authentic hadith which is narrated by abdullah may allah be pleased with the man with his father that's in it's in the sahih the prophet said allah is that the deceased is tormented by his family's crying weeping or wailing depending on how you translate the word and this is an issue that caused dispute among the scholars so the hadith is authentic without any doubt narrated by umar himself may allah be pleased with him and his son abdullah ibn umar and the muslim and a great number of scholars and and companions that is who accepted it as it is mother ishmael be pleased with her she said no they misheard the hadith the prophet said that the kafir the disbeliever is being tormented by the weeping of his family because allah says in the quran no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another well so what is his fault to be tormented for someone's else action and the scholars brought a number of interpretations they said first of all the hadith is crystal clear there's no doubt about it secondly the understanding of the hadith they gave a number of interpretation one that the deceased himself before dying made a will and advised and ordered his family to wail and cry and shout and tear their hair and and dresses like the pre-islamic era used to do another interpretation is that he knows that this is the custom of the women and the fab and the people in his community yet he did not tell them not to do that he was okay with it he did not order them but he was okay with it and all of these are weak interpretations as stated by ibn tamiyami al-abi have mercy on him and he said that the most authentic opinion is that tormenting a deceased is not punishment what you have discomfort with is not necessarily a punishment so such a torment is not a punishment for what they're doing it is something that saddens you and he gives a similar hadith where the prophet said allah traveling is a piece of torment prevents a person from eating and drinking so the prophet described traveling at isla to be a piece of torment though there's nobody punishing you for it but this is the hardship that you will face so a deceased faced face such a hardship if his family weep and to be specific whale see crying is not a sin weeping is not a sin and a deceased would not be tormented because of his family's weeping the prophet himself had a soul of some wept when his child when his only son ibrahim died so he said the eyes weep and the heart is saddened and we do not say except what pleases allah and by allah we are saddened for departing you o ibrahim therefore weeping is totally a human characteristic it's only natural what it is what is not is wailing when women start tearing their clothes and pulling their hair or slapping their faces and saying oh he was my husband he was my father he was my brother he was my rock that i depended on he was this he was that this is when the disease would be tormented and if he ordered that he would be punished for it and then there are so many hadith stating that there is an angel pinching the deceased telling him are you like what they're saying are you her rock are you this are you that so this is a form of it and allah azza knows best"
