  "title": "Doing Hifz so people will think she is knowledgeable & accept her dawah   SHIRK",
  "transcript": "Julie from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu If someone is doing his but in her mind she thinks that if I become hafiz people will think I am knowledgeable and when I Talk against bid'ah or shirk or about fatwa, then they will accept me So she wants wants to become more knowledgeable. Is her hifz rejected? Is this shirk? definitely The Prophet alayhis salatu wassalam said Deeds are judged by intentions and when a person is so inclined Towards religion so keen in doing dawah He would like people to accept his dawah not To get prominence and to get praise and compliment rather to get closer to Allah And if I know that people would not accept my dawah without proof and evidence without a degree Without being a prominent student of knowledge So I do seek knowledge for the sake of Allah so that Allah would grant me Acceptance to the people when I give them dawah. This is fine. It's a win-win however no one on earth to my knowledge would seek knowledge and seek a degree in Islamic studies in order to Be pointed at oh this guy has a PhD in Sharia. Oh He has masters from this prestigious University and he would feel happy about it because this is a breach in his intention if he does it for the sake of getting closer to Allah gaining knowledge and Having acceptance with the people to know that he has the right credentials Whatever comes is a byproduct When people come and say Oh Sheikh Asim, you give dawah. You're very prominent. You're very famous on social media You're this you're that I think to myself. What am I doing here? Am I doing it to gain number of followers? I will go to hell if I This was my intention am I doing it to get rich I'm in the in the wrong business Definitely, you can't get rich from this unless you give fatwas and you gain money because you returned divorced people ten times to their husbands which After threes is nonsense Or I can say haram things are halal and sign on it and get a stamp Islamically Yeah, this is this would would make me rich but now normally speaking. No, it would not make you rich So what's your intention? My intention is to call to Allah Is to guide people to Islam and to follow the Sunnah and to correct their Aqeedah simple as that. Ah Do you have any? ill-motives hidden agenda a Special private vendetta You want authority you want control over people you want a position in the government? No, I don't and you can see where I am at where the other Shuyukh are at in this case. What you're doing is for Allah. Here is where Shaitaan would hammer you the hardest Oh, no. No. No, your intention is for this your intention is for that Why to stop you and prevent you from making dawah or from getting closer to Allah here is where you have to draw the line and Defy what Shaitaan is telling you by doing the opposite and continue to do your dawah"
