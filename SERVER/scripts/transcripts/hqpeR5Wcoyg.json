  "transcript": "[Questions ]from Bangladesh okay so my question \nis uh I know that Drop Shipping is Haram in Islam   but there is a company called AliExpress they \nprovide a service called Ali Dropship where   basically I have to pay them an amount of fees \nfor the first time and they will make a website   what if anyone orders something it will go to \nAliExpress and they will handle everything such   as delivery and others so is it permissible \n[Music] okay again the issue of drop shopping   being not permissible is due to the presence of \nselling what you do not have so if Alibaba Express   opens a website for you so people would see the \nitems and they would request it and they would do   the service on your behalf again you're delegating \nselling what is not in your position to someone   else and the ruling Remains the Same we've said \nthis before that the alternative for Drop Shipping   is to have As-Salam transaction an \nAs-salamtransaction is an Islamic   alternative for Drop Shipping providing it \nhas three conditions fulfilled number one   that the payment is paid in full in advance \nso I want to sell you this mug it is one Euro   you're interested I don't have this monk I \nonly have a snap shot of it or a sample of   it so you give me a euro in advance condition \nnumber two the description of this mug is fully   comprehensive so I don't say to you it's a mug \nor it's black no I have to say the dimensions   what quality what are the Fabrics the material \nit's made of if it's a fruit I have to identify   what type of fruit what category of species it \nis so that there is no ambiguity none whatsoever   the description has to be comprehensive \nnumber three the delivery date has to be fixed   approximately so I can't say I'll ship it to you \nin the fall this is not accepted or in year 2023   I have to be specific in the first week of \nFebruary for example or on the 20th 20th of   February or the likes so that there would be no \nambiguity this is halal transaction insha Allah"
