  "transcript": "do we have to sit in t in second ra of as far as vah is concerned V in Arabic means odd so as far as V is concerned we can pray with either one ra or three ra or five ra or seven ra or n ra any odd number from these it's called a Salah but naturally the prophet mostly prayed three the question is that do we have to sit in t in the second ra he didn't mention which with is it one or five or seven or n but mainly be referring to the three as far as one ra is concerned of course you have to sit in that one RA in t if it's a three ra with the prophet said that your with should not be like that of the M Salah so the more appropriate method of praying with if you're praying three raat is either to pray two ra and say the and then pray one Raa after that it becomes three ra or you pray three ra together but you only sit in the last RA in the T you do not sit for T in the second ra to follow the commander of the Prophet that do not let your with be similar to the m Salah so if you're praying Salah you should not sit in t in the second ra you only sit for T in the last ra that's the third ra if you praying five ra you not sit in t for the first four ra only in the last RA in the fifth ra sit for T if you are playay seven ra there also you do not sit in t for the first six ra you only sit in t for the last ra that is seven ra if you are praying n ra you sit in t only for the last ra that is the eighth and the ninth ra so this you get from the authentic Hadith of the Beloved prophet and hope that anwers the question"
