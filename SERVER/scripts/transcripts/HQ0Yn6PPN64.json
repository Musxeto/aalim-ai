  "title": "Freelancer's: Should You Inform Clients About Delegating Projects if you take a percentage? assim",
  "transcript": "s fars from the Emirates my question is that uh I am a freelancer so sometimes a projects come to me from a client uh and I don't have such expertise to do it so I will go to some other person to get it done and uh when the other person is going to do that project I discuss with him that okay this is the budget for that project and I am going to take 20% of the amount that we agreed because I am the person who is uh who is bringing this project so is this permissible uh to just uh directly in contact with the person who is doing this project or should I have to notify the other person from whom I am getting the project as well there is a legal Maxim and a ruling in Islam that states which roughly translates the prophet that you May gain is dependent on you guaranteeing the work so if someone comes to me with a project of 100,000 Dirham and the description is well defined the ins and outs the expectations the deliverables everything is set the quality the time frame and I agree and I subcontract it to someone else for 80,000 Dirham so I take 20,000 in my pocket however if the subcontractor messes up I'm the one who's paying for damages and I'm the one who's liable for any um uh Corrections needed because the client knows no one other than me and I'm the one who's taking the profit if this is the case there's no problem inshallah"
