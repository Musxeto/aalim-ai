  "transcript": "Faheem from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I have a question that if the household people in our house sleep for example my brother while going as a if he sleeps and does not pray and say I will pray I will pray is it fair for me to fight with him and make him to pray or shall I leave him to sleep first of all you're not his mother so you cannot force him to pray you're not his father either so you have the authority to advise but nothing else so your parents your siblings you do not have authority to change the evil and vice with your own hands you have this authority over your wife over your children so all what you can do is just remind your brother of Allah and ask him to pray ask him to sleep early and if he doesn't wake up this is his sin he's an adult and he's going to pay for that dearly in this life in his grave and on the day of judgment you've done your due diligence and Allah knows best you"
