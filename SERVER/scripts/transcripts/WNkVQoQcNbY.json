  "title": "Do I need to repeat Ghusl for Chemical Henna once? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah So I mistakenly applied chemical henna which does lay on the skin and I did not know that but when I found out I repeated my ghusl because I did it with that henna and I did tayammum and I've been doing wudu for all my prayers but now the henna is gone do I need to repeat my ghusl? As long as you have performed ghusl and did henna for the part that was unable to be washed there is no need insha'Allah to repeat your ghusl you need to repeat your ghusl if you for example could not find water and you made ghusl by only making tayammum tayammum and after five six days you were able to find water in this case your ghusl is invalid you have to perform a full ghusl but making a full ghusl while avoiding for example washing the hair due to the presence of a layer that prevents water from reaching it this is a full ghusl with the exception of washing the hair I presume and I believe insha'Allah that there is no need to repeat the ghusl however if just to be safe rather than sorry you repeat it that would be much better and Allah knows best"
