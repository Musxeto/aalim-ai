  "transcript": "Z from Kashmir sh my question is regarding the issue of RA the raising of hands in prayer I currently follow the hanafi school of thought and we raise our hands only in the beginning of the prayer based on the narration of abdah authenticated by some Scholars including but so many people come and tease us and compare us to ganis and uh call us the enemies of prophet and give the references of je and claim it is a book written by Im bukari so my question is regarding the issue ofan and the is the book authentic or not the byar first of all the issue of labeling someone who does not follow a particular Sunnah that's the ruling of it that it is recommended ended not that it is halal Haram rather it's a Sunnah if you do it you're rewarded if you don't do it you're not sinful labeling people who abandon such a Sunnah as enemies of Islam is the work of these are ignorant imbeciles no muslim who follows the Sunnah when seeing a hanafi not raising his hands in Ru and after rising from ru would say that oh he's an enemy of the Sunnah or that he's this or he's that why because it's a Sunnah even in the beginning of the Salat if I lead this the prayer and I say and then I [Music] sayb I don't raise my hands my prayer is valid 100% I don't put my hands on my chest I don't have to it's not a must it's a recommended Sunnah but if I don't the prayer is valid so to neglect the most important issues in Islam and focus on causing enmity and grudges between the Muslims over a trivial issue which is a Sunnah but it's a trivial issue compared to the big issues not that it is not important yes it is part of the Sunnah but is it as important as having the unity among the Muslims of course not to focus on that this is the strategy of shatan and whoever follows it is a follower of Shan it's like when I go to a Hani Masjid and I've heard this so many times they say if we raise our hands in R and in in rising from the r if we say after after if we don't wear a toppy or a cap people would almost fight with us these are ignorant imbeciles oh they're Hani so what because they're focusing on something that is not part of the Salat in the sense that it would invalidate it it is a Sunnah if you do it you're rewarded if you don't you miss a great deal of reward but there is no sin on you so don't go to extreme and listen to these imbeciles who say you're enemies of Islam but at the same time have a free will in following what the prophet didat and his companions not following Imam shafii Imam Ahmed Imam Malik or Imam Abu hanifah they're all great Scholars of Islam but they're not mentioned in the Quran nor in the Sunnah and in the Quran Allah tells us to obey and follow the Quran and to follow his Sunnah so we look at what the prophet did Alam and we follow it and then you will be on the right path"
