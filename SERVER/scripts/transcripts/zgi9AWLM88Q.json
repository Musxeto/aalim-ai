  "transcript": "Halima from France. yesterday you told me that all Takbir are very important in Salah but mine specific Takbir is the one for the second Raka'a. Sir, the second and the third Raka'a in prayer. The answer is the same. What's the problem? I don't hear you. Like I must say the Takbir before standing up for the second Raka'a. It is mandatory, it is obligatory. What's the problem? Like the problem is when I say the Raka'a for Ruku and this first Sujood and the second Sujood and I want to, I do make some pause before going to the second Raka'a. So I don't know why standing up. How would you raise your head from the second Sujood? If you're in the second Sujood and you want to stand up to the second Raka'a, what do you do? I say the Takbir. No, no, no. After rising my head up from the second Sujood, I do make some pause like you say in your video. Yes, but how can you raise your head from Sujood without Takbir? So you raise your head, you say Allahu Akbar, you do the small pause and you stand up. Okay, the standing up, must I say the Takbir again? Why standing up? No, you don't do Takbir again because you did not move into a pillar. The movement from Sujood is a pillar to the standing position is a pillar. This is when you do Takbir. But when you raise your head from Sujood and you sit for a short pause of two seconds, this is not sitting for a pillar or mandatory action. This is a Sunnah. So this is just a pause and you stand up afterwards without saying anything."
