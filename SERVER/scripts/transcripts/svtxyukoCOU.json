  "transcript": "Murree from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, due to ignorance I did not know many rules of Islam and praying for many years and like such as excretion of money requires ghusl, how to take proper ghusl, the pillars of Islam, pillars of prayer and I prayed like this for many years, so do I have to repeat all of my fourth and conditional prayers? The answer is no because the time has elapsed and there is great hardship resulting from that and due to your ignorance Allah would not hold you accountable for that. From now on all what you need to do is to repent, ask Allah for forgiveness, pray on time and learn your religion. It is mandatory upon you and those who are like you to learn the essentials and the basics of issues related to purity, to major and minor ritual purity and impurity and how to remove that and how to pray on time and in the right fashion and alhamdulillah if you go to my YouTube channel you will find all of these issues explained so that you could follow it with ease inshaAllah."
