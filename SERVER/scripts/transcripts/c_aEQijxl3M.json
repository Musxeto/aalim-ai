  "transcript": "brother asif from india saying that what is the duration of a journey where I'm entitled to shorten my prayers and to skip fasting Ramadan the Quran did not specify a duration the Sunnah certainly did not specify a duration the Prophet Ali salatu salam had a number of journeys where he skipped fasting and where he shortened prayers from ranging from 4 days to 19 days and we don't have a limit for that and this is why scholars say such an eleven taymiyah a shia bimba a Shibboleth a mean al albani and other great scholars of islam say that it depends on your situation as an individual you and I can travel to let's say Delhi and after five six days of our travel I feel at home the the the apartment I rent or the hotel room I have is so comfortable I go to the salat I come back everything is set I feel like home so I complete my prayers and I fast you on the other hand may not feel so comfortable let's not say it's Delhi let's say it's Chennai because Dell is your hometown you don't feel so comfortable and you may stay there for three weeks or four weeks still not accustomed to being there and not settled so you continue to shorten and you have the right to skip fasting Ramadan therefore if your father goes to your brother and he stays there for a month if he is settled after one week which usually most of parents are because they have their own room and they are comfortable with their grandchildren and they feel home then after that they have to complete if he doesn't feel settled for a whole month he can shorten the whole thing it's something between him and Alonzo John no one can hold him accountable or put him in jail for it because it is something between him and Allah"
