  "transcript": "from bangladesh says now you said that it is permissible for us and recommended to pray at the beginning of the time though in my country they delay the salah the adhan of asar for example by almost an hour and of fajr maybe i don't know how long half an hour 40 minutes so i know that you say that it's best to pray once the time is due but is there any benefit the answer is yes especially for asar for fajr for maghrib the prophet said allah when he was asked about the most beloved deeds to allah he said to pray on time in another narration he said to pray at the beginning of the time and us are exempted because it is sunnah to delay when it is summer and it's hot throughout the whole year it's recommended to delay so she's asking if i don't want to pray at the beginning of the time and want to pray when the adam is cold which is a little bit delayed is there in a problem the answer is no as long as you're praying within the parameters of the prayer beginning and end there is no issue in that insha allah"
