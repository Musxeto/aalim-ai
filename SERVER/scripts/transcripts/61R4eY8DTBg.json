  "transcript": "Najwa from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. If a woman does Salah intentionally with tight clothes, for example like a tight top or tight leggings or trousers, but no skin is showing, is her Salah valid? Is she wearing an outer garment? No. This is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that though she is sinful and committing a sin by wearing such revealing clothes, scholars say that her body is covered. Yes, it's covered with inappropriate clothing, but still it is covered. So some of the scholars say that her prayer is valid, others say that no. This type of clothes were described or was described by the Prophet ﷺ in the authentic Hadith that there are two types of people of hellfire I have not seen. One of them are the women wearing such clothes that are revealing and they're either revealing because they're see-through or because they are so tight as if they're not wearing any clothes. So some scholars say that yes, the prayer is valid, she's sinful. Others say it is not valid and I'm inclined to the latter opinion which is, it is not valid for not wearing what covers her body properly. If this is not permissible to be shown in front of non-mahram men outside, how would you pray like this in front of Allah? Are you kidding? Why are you doing such a thing when you know that Allah is angry and not pleased with what you're doing and Allah knows best."
