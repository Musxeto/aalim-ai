  "transcript": "the next question is from an anonymous listener a viewer can a bad dua or curse backfire this is in allah's hands we cannot say it can backfire you can make dua which is bad and allah makes it happen oh allah destroyed this person who oppressed me and allah destroys him maybe allah doesn't destroy him so it is stored for you on the day of judgment or allah deflects something harmful equivalent to it that was destined to happen but because you made dua allah deflected it from you maybe you make dua and it doesn't backfire but allah tests you with an illness with poverty with the calamity and you get to think that oh i'm a dua now it's backfiring at me which is not true in any entirely we don't have evidence to prove it backfired and we don't have proof that it was not because of that so this is all in allah's hands"
