  "transcript": "Ubaid from Tunisia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Salam wa Rahmatullah. I love you for the sake of Allah. May Allah love you back. Jazak Allah Khair. Jazak. My question is, is it from the Sunnah to pray Hajj after praying Taraweeh with the Imam till the end, meaning we pray Witr with him? And what about the last nights? Okay, first of all we have to make something clear. Taraweeh is the name of night prayer that is offered in congregation during the month of Ramadan. So if you pray with your wife or with your friends night prayer in Shawwal, in Muharram, this is not called Taraweeh. The name Taraweeh is given to the congregational prayer offered during the month of Ramadan. So it's night prayer. Why do we pray it after Isha? Because it's more convenient for us. We have so many things. So if we're coming to the prayer for Isha, then it is convenient for the vast majority of us to pray night prayer in congregation together and offer Witr. If a woman is not praying in the masjid and she says, Sheikh can I pray Taraweeh after Isha? Of course, but because you're praying home alone, it's best for you to delay it in the last third of the night so it becomes Tahajjud and Taraweeh at the same time, but it's night prayer. Therefore, if a group of Muslims in a community, let's say they are living offshore, somewhere in a compound, and there are 10 of them, and they all agree that, listen, during the month of Ramadan, we'll pray Isha together and retire to our quarters, and then we will pray at 1am the Taraweeh, which is Tahajjud. That's totally fine and legitimate and the best the best scenario ever to be done. If you pray Taraweeh with the congregation in the masjid and they offer Witr with the Imam, and then you go home and after five, six hours, an hour or so before Fajr, you want to pray Tahajjud, there's no problem in that. But due to the prohibition of praying two Witr in one night, I've already prayed my Witr. So you pray two rak'ahs, two rak'ahs, without any Witr, and with that you conclude your Tahajjud prayer, because you've already prayed Witr in the beginning, so you don't repeat it. I hope this answers your question."
