  "transcript": "Wa Alaikumussalamatullah Sheikh, I have a question. What's the ruling on using a snapshot because people have horoscopes in them? And what if there is a way to remove these horoscopes? Will a person's prayer be invalid or unaccepted for 40 days? Yusuf, what's the ruling on reading newspapers where there is a whole page dedicated for horoscopes? Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen said that you tear the page that has the horoscopes. Okay, meaning if you don't tear it, if you're in a public library, if you're in a restaurant or on the train, and you find it to read it, definitely you're not going to read it. Okay, meaning if you don't tear it, if you're in a public library, if you're in a restaurant or on the train, and you find it to read it, definitely you're not going to tear it. Because this is not yours and you are not authorized to do it. So basically, use your logic, brother. If you're using Snapchat or any other application that has a horoscope and you don't deal with it, you don't read it, you don't look at it, there is nothing wrong in that, inshallah."
