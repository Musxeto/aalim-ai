  "transcript": "Yusuf says, 'there is a man who says that having \na seminar is a bid'ah and it's not permissible   because, there's no evidence backing it up.' \nThese people are ignorant imbeciles. You should   not listen or take knowledge from such people.The \nProphet, 'alayhi salatu wa salam, did not restrict   delivering knowledge to people. \nHe said [بَلِّغُوا عَنِّي وَلَوْ   آيَةً]'relay on my behalf, even \nif one verse of the Qur'an.'   He did not specify - should it be through \na CD, a radio, a satellite channel,   a youtube channel, instagram, should it be \nwritten form, should it be audio, should it   be video - which means that, the sky is the limit \nas long as the purpose is to relay, to deliver.   Then how you do this doesn't matter. And \nthis is why we give a lecture in the masjid   after salat using microphones. Should we turn \noff the lights and the air conditioning and the   sound system because this is a bid'ah? Don't \ntake your knowledge from ignorant imbeciles.   Such people are fame seekers. They want people \nto point at them and say 'wow, he said something.   Whoopie!' That's... This is nonsense what \nthey're saying. It has no value none whatsoever."
