  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh I wanted to ask about a hadith. Is this, one second, is this Sadiqa still on the line or what? Okay, I think she's gone. Yes. I'm sorry. Sheikh I wanted to ask about a hadith narrated from Anas Ibn Malik R.A. that Umm Sulaym asked the Prophet to teach her about something to say during the prayer and he told her to, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, told her to read Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar ten times during the prayer. So one of the Sheikh taught us that we should recite them before the Salam in the Tashahud. Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar ten times. All these three Afqar ten times before saying the Salam. So is this correct or should we say it after saying the Salam? First of all, I have to go back to the hadith. My memory is not as strong as it was. Although I did Husnul Muslim, the Fortress of the Muslim, Alhamdulillah, and it's on my YouTube channel, it's on Huda channel, I think it's also on Zad TV channel. I forget. The Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar ten times is authentic as Adhkar after the Salat is over. And we said this so many times. We can say Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar thirty-three times, and then we say, this is one version. Or we can say Subhanallah, thirty-three, Alhamdulillah, thirty-three, Allahu Akbar thirty-four, which is similar to what we say before we go to bed. Or we say Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar ten times. There's also another one saying it twenty-five times. All of these are different variations and it's all, Alhamdulillah, acceptable and valid. But this specific dhikr, is it to be said before the Salam? No, I don't know anything to be said before the Salam as such. Is it to be said as Adhkar of inauguration of the Salat after the first Takbeer? I have to revise this and go check it out because as I said, my memory is not as it used to be, Alhamdulillah."
