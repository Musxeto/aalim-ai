  "title": "Milk & Meat of Domesticated Donkeys assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The first question is from Anne Breen. She says, Is the milk of domesticated donkeys permissible? Is it recommended in the Shari'ah to give this to babies? Now, the essence is that everything on earth is halal. This is the Islamic concept. Everything on earth is halal until there is an evidence to prohibit it. And Allah Azza Wa Jal has made everything for us halal. When we come to animals, if someone asks us about the milk of horses, the milk of cows, the milk of sheep, of camels, etc. All these, we without any hesitation would say it's halal. Because the meat of that particular animal, when slaughtered in an Islamic and proper way, it is halal for us. Therefore, everything of this animal is halal as well. When looking at domestic donkeys, and why do we say domestic? Because in the beginning, all types of donkeys were halal. Whether domestic or wild. But later on, as in the hadith of Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that it was announced on the year of Khaibar, the seventh year of Hijrah, that the Prophet ï·º prohibited the meat of domesticated donkeys. So, since that date, it is prohibited for Muslims to consume the meat of domesticated donkeys. And the majority of scholars say, the ruling of milk is the same as the ruling of the meat. Which means that it is najis, and it is not permissible for a Muslim to consume it, or to have it as a medicine. Because when Allah Azza Wa Jal prohibits something, Allah prohibits selling it, and Allah Azza Wa Jal even prohibits consuming it for medication, because your cure was not placed in something that is haram. The general rule in regards to wild donkeys, known as zebras, remains as it is, and it's halal. So, it's a game. If someone hunts it, it is permissible for us to consume its meat. And that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me, and let's speak about it inshallah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
