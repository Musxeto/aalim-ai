  "transcript": "The Hajj and Umrah cannot be for worldly matters, \ncannot be for people. It's only for the sake of Allah the Almighty. And this is why a pilgrim \nalways in the state of Talbiya while he's in his Ihram, what is \nTalbiyyah? It is to proclaim, [ ], translating to Here I am, O Allah, Here I am. Here I am, you have no partner, here \nI am. Verily all praise and blessings are yours and all sovereignty, \nyou have no partner. Here I am, I'm proclaiming, I'm responding to your call. O Allah the Almighty, when you called us to come to Hajj, Here I am."
