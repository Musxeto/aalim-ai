  "transcript": "three questions uh all related it's a catholic faith are given to you together and you can split them up the first is when do we give the catholic fitter can it be money or food and what type of food if it is to be filled well first of all the cattle footer has to be paid before the performance of salatul 8 and salat as we know it's after fajr prayer on the first day of shawwal on the day of 8. so before that you must give it but can you give it on the 15th of ramadan for example because it's before that the scholars say no you can do pay it two to three days before eight so starting from the 27th onwards of ramadan you can pay the cattle filter providing that you do not exceed salat elite if it's after salatul 8 the time has expired and it would not be zakat alfredo anymore as for the question can we pay it in money in forms of money the answer would be no because the prophet allah is the one who specified as in this the hadith of abbas may be pleased with them all that we pay it and in the form of food so of food and this food as a scholar say is what the people eat and are able to store so any food that you can weigh or and that is you can weigh and store you can use this so dates would do wheat would do and nowadays in the arab world rice is the best food they usually consume so everybody is getting uh rice as zakat al fateh usama from pakistan says what's the difference the difference between fatrana and zakat futra or zakatul is a specific amount of food to be given prior to the day of eid and it should be one or two nights before eid so on the 28th or the 29th you can give it to the poor and the size of it is well defined and it is not in accordance to your income or your savings so the prophet as in the hadith may allah appears with them and others he prescribed that the cattle fitter to be given out from staple food the size of one sar and the tsar is a a means of measurement a unit of measurement by size and not by weight so if you bring 2.125 kilograms of rice and put it in a vessel this vessel becomes a sar empty it and you can put in it dates barley wheat raisin whatever that can fit in that vessel and you can give it to the poor a day or two before eight most importantly before the salah because after it's a lot it's over the time is is gone zakat normally speaking this is a pillar of islam and by the way this zakatul fitter or fetrana as you guys call it in urdu the cattle fitter is to be given one sar the measurement that i have just mentioned upon every individual or slave a free man or slave man or woman young or old it should be given upon muslims only so if i have 10 people living in my home and i'm the breadwinner i give the zakat for 11 me included with them so that's 11. and so on you"
