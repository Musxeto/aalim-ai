  "title": "Will a Student of Knowledge be MORE punished if he wastes time on YouTube, Video Games, ETC",
  "transcript": "Mohsin from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, my question is what is the ruling on a student of knowledge or someone who is eager to increase his knowledge and piety, wasting his time with video games, YouTube, or even football training? And will he be held accountable more than other Muslims because Allah gave him the bounty of guidance, but still sometimes he falls short in seeking knowledge and being following the way of the scholars, and especially if he has high aspirations to be one of them. Barak Allahu Fikum and may Allah accept from you. And may Allah Azza Wa Jal put Barakah in you and our viewers. Akhi, life is a test and it is not a one size that fits all. And people differ in their inclination, orientation, and aspiration. Some of the people have high aspiration and they are really dedicated to what they do. And Allah puts Barakah in their life and their time and their knowledge. Some people are qualified, may Allah forgive us, but they don't have the aspiration. They don't have the zeal and the power to pursue, so they may fall weak or lag behind. We don't jump the gun and say, okay, those are punished more than others because they're more qualified. This is in Allah's hands. But if you want to reach high goals, you have to spend time and money. You cannot reach the stars by sleeping on your bed at night. And therefore, if you have such high aspirations and you waste your time on video games, on watching TikTok, or wasting your time on social media in general, then you've lost. And this is a clear sign that you're not up to it. Make du'a, surround yourself with righteous practicing students of knowledge, because this motivates you to compete and to excel in your pursuit of such a noble cause. And Allah knows best."
