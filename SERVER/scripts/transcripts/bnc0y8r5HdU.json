  "transcript": "Sidi from Germany. Sheikh, how should we Muslims treat to family members, working colleagues who are strict to us, angry, who are not merciful? How should we treat them according to the sunnah? Again, I always use this, don't be offended. When a dog barks at you, you never fall on your hands and knees to bark back. So when people of ignorance, even if they're dear to you and you love them and you respect them and they're related to you, or colleagues or friends, treat you badly or angrily, don't react. Who cares? What counts is what's in your heart. Akhi, we can always go down to people's levels. If they curse, we can curse. If they beat us, we can beat them back. But this doesn't make us any better. The Prophet said, alayhis salatu was salam, laysa shadidu bis sura'ah. A strong man is not a person who defeats others in fighting and wrestling. Rather, a strong man is the one who controls himself in anger. This is the real man. So when they abuse you, when they misbehave with you, ignore them. Give them a big smile, never defeat, never defend yourself, never argue with them or talk back, ignore it. Believe me, they will, with all due respect, act like a dog after a while. They will bark, bark, bark, and then they'll get tired. Because you're not responding, they have failed to provoke you to answer back, they will let go. But the moment you show a reaction or a negative response, they will continue to bark till the Day of Judgment. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
