  "title": "If one of the limb dries up, would that break continuation of Wudu",
  "transcript": "Sammy from the US um so if I spend 10 to 15 minutes doing will do and maybe sometimes while I'm washing a limb a part of the same limb drives up with that break continuation first of all the concept of one of your limbs drying while doing wudu invalidates the wudu is not true especially in hot climated weather countries so if I'm in a hot country and I wash my face by the time I'm through washing my arms my face would have dried so I have to repeat the order again no this is not correct so where did this concept come from most likely when the scholars mentioned that there are six pillars of wudu the first to be washing the face then washing the arms to the elbows then wiping the head and the ears then washing the feet then to be in this particular order and finally number six is to be simultaneous when they mentioned the issue of being simultaneous they wanted to elaborate a little bit so they thought that the closest to people's minds would be that if there was a pause between washing a limb and the other one and this pause was long enough for the limb to dry this means that it was not uh done simultaneously or consecutively hence the water is invalid but this was not mentioned in the Quran or in the Sunnah so being simultaneous or consecutive of one and after or the other is true without having a pause but what do we mean by pause we mean that if you wash your face and someone knocks on your door you don't go out to check whether it's the delivery coming or not and speak with them and sign a paper and go back to the toilet and then wash your arms no this was interrupted so having it dry does not impact your wudu nevertheless to take 10 minutes or 15 minutes in wudu this is outrageous and it shows that you have a serious problem that has to be fixed because this is not what Islam is about Islam is a religion of peace of moderation of Tranquility and what you're doing is none of dimensioned above used to perform wudu with what is known as a mud which is approximately 0.7 liter or less about about 0.7 liter which means that if I fill up this mug I can make wudu from this which also means that his wudu would take probably 50 seconds a minute at most but when you perform wudu 10 to 15 minutes this means that you're using gallons of water not liters and you are definitely doing something the prophet did not do so you tell me are you more knowledgeable than the prophet Allah definitely not are you more God-fearing and righteous then the prophet Islam definitely not so there is no other choice or alternative left other than to say that you are having extreme OCD that is compelling you to go out of the way of the Prophet is out of his Sunnah this is something you have to address before it is too late"
