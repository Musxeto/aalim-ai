  "transcript": "hell film second question she said that I mentioned in a lecture that there are four percentages of zakat and this is this needs explanation first of all we all know that gold silver stocks currency things that are made for trade selling and buying they the zakat percentage is quarter of the tenth which is 2.5% and to make it easier if you have money instead of multiplying it by 2.5 then dividing it by a hundred just simply whatever amount you have and you want to know how much does the cat is divided by 14 the result is Georgia cut its you don't have to be a rocket scientist I have a hundred thousand divided by 40 you'll get two thousand five hundred this is your zakat and so on so this is the first percentage the second percentage is five percent useful oh sure half of the tenth and this is due on crops that are irrigated by me so I have a well and there is a motor that I put diesel in to pump the water up so that I can irrigate or I bring pipes from a nearby river and I make a lot of construction to get the water to my farm so I'm putting effort in it this I have to pay five percent of the crops specific crops of course because fruits we don't have the cut on oranges or apples or bananas or even vegetables so there are specific crops that we have to pay zakat third percentage is ten percent which is the tenth of what the earth produces providing that I have no effort in irrigating it so it waters itself or the water is so close by that there are no need for generators or for palms or for building anything they just it it's irrigated by rainfall in this case I have to give 10% because there is no financial burden on my side number four is when it is the fifth or twenty percent and this is specific in what is known as Erika's and Adric as as defined by scholars is the treasure of pre-islamic era so if I dig and I find a chest and there is a lot of gold coins in it and I look at the gold coins and it says the Roman Empire its pre-islamic era this is called Rica's it's a treasure and I have to give 20% of it people differ whether it is treated as Fae or treat it as a treasure or treat it as a catapult for the cause of allah azza wajal but if it is from the islamic era if it was like four hundred five hundred years ago with the seal of the ottoman empire or something close to that this is not records because this belongs to a muslim and i have to look for that muslims so these are the four categories or percentages of zakat"
