  "title": "A Sheikh said I can make up a prayer that I deliberately missed, is it true? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh our first caller is Yousef from the Emirates uh my question for tonight is um so a person for many years whenever he slept and he intended to pray fer but then wakes up like at 9:00 a.m. and misses fer he wakes up and then decides to go back to sleep and it's too tired to pray um he wakes up at 11: and thinks that he should not pray because he has missed the time of prayer so so he shouldn't prayed uh but then he goes and asks the she and the Sheik tells him no you should still pray that in that situation if that person is still not convinced uh what should he do in this situation like should he make up these missed prayers what is what is he supposed to do first of all what he has done is a major sin the prophet said in an authentic Hadith whoever oversleeps a prayer or forgets it two reasons over sleeping or forgetting it must pray it as soon as he remembers quote unquote or wakes up there is no the prophet says there is no experation other than that other than what other than praying it as soon as you remember or wake up which means that if you wake up at 9:00 and you find out that the sun has already risen and you say to yourself that matter as well go back to sleep you have not done the experation mentioned in the Hadith of the Prophet Alam and hence you cannot pray it when you wake up at 11: even if you do it has no value and you're sinful big time for this major sin so what the sheh told you is in correct and you have to start from today to man up and to sleep early and to make prayers your priority in life otherwise you are in deep trouble"
