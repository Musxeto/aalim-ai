  "transcript": "he says can you talk to us about us be pleased with him unfortunately i don't recall a lot about usaid except for example that he is the one who saw the angels descending while he was reciting surah till kaf with his son sleeping next to him and his horse tied to uh in the house and whenever this uh cloud of light descended the horse would be hyper and he would stop so that it would not step on the child and the prophet told him that these were the angels coming to listen to you recite the quran if i'm not mistaken also and this is from my memory i'm i'm old so if i make a mistake i'll wait for your hate mail um was the cousin of saddam may allah be pleased with him and um well actually uh maybe him or someone else anyhow he was with saddam when muslim came to preach islam in medina and he dispatched us to stop him because no he wasn't the cousin of saddam there was a um someone else with musa i forgot his name who was the cousin of uh even so sad sent usaid to stop them and when he came to stop them they called him to islam and he accepted islam so he went back to saad and played the trick telling him that the people of tribe zone so are attempting to kill your cousin so sad went and when he saw them sitting there in peace he knew that they he was tricked so he listened to them he accepted islam and there are a number of other uh attributes i think he also was one of the nu abba who gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet son when he was in mecca so he was one of the envoys who came from medina to give the pledge of allegiance and invite the prophet assam to migrate to medina knows best"
