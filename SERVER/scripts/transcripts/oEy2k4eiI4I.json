  "transcript": "Muhammad from Azerbaijan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum When I pray in the masjid I sometimes have a feeling of like, can I pray those prayers when I should pray while away? Like to first raka'at of Maghreb and to first raka'at of Isha silently because of this feeling? Now are you asking me that what's the ruling on praying Maghreb or Isha silently whether I am in the masjid or I'm at home? No basically if I pray like that because I fear that someone watches me because of my recitation. And this is fard and we're talking about fard? Yes. No first of all the ruling of raising your voice in the first two raka'at of Fajr, the first two raka'at of Maghreb and first raka'at of Isha is a sunnah. Whether you're praying it in the masjid or at home this is a confirmed sunnah. If someone for any reason wants to recite it silently not to wake up the children, not to bother or annoy others for any reason, this is halal. If you're afraid of them liking your voice this is something that you have to work on. I wouldn't say it's shirk or riyah but I would say that you have to work on because you never know maybe your voice would be the reason for them to be guided and Allah knows best. you"
