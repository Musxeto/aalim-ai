  "title": "If Shaytan Iblis is MADE of fire, how will he be punished with fire in Hell?",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Sri Lanka yeah so my \nquestion is uh about the shaytan so he's   a demon made out of fire so and I heard that \nuh he kind of he can't stand heat and stuff   and also whether he'll be punished in the \nhell fire so uh how is this uh what's it   possible how can I go fire hurt fire \nMuhammad what were you created from so what were you created from from mud so tell me \nif there is a Mudslide may Allah protect you and   your family and you're buried under the mud would \nyou feel comfortable and cozy or would you die what would you die I would die \nokay how if you were made of mud did I answer your question or not yet so basically speaking yes though \nthe essence of the creation of Satan   and the Jinn they were created from \nfire this does not mean that fire   would not be a source of Torment for them \nbecause as we are originally created from clay   or from mud if someone holds a brick of clay \nand throws it to our heads we're gonna bleed   and feel the pain so this has nothing to \ndo with that and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
