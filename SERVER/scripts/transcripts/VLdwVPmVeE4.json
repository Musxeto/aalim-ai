  "title": "My sister & I were born out of wedlock, who is my sisters Wali? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We have brother Amal from Tunisia. Okay, so Sheikh I have three questions, is it possible? Yes, In Sha Allah. Okay, so my first question is, unfortunately I was born out of wedlock. I have a younger sister, she's also born out of wedlock, unfortunately. I'm the only brother my sister has. My mom is now married, so my question is, who is the wali of my sister? Who is your father and who is your sister's father? Wait, wait, wait. Who is your father and who is your sister's father? Is he the same man? We don't have the same father. You don't have the same father. Okay, first of all, okay. Your sister, who was born out of wedlock, and you don't share the same father with her, you cannot be her wali. Her wali, if she doesn't have a paternal family that she can be attributed to, her wali becomes the Muslim judge in the country she's living in. So the Muslim ruler, the Muslim judge, or the authorized Islamic center, the imam authorized there, would become her guardian, but not you. The imam or the ruler can appoint you, but not you. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
