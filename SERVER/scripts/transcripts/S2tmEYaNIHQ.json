  "title": "Is Bulimia or binge eating sinful in Islam (vomiting food)? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Shukum from Oman. Sheikh, my question is like the binge eating, is it permissible for example if someone eats sweets and then they are in the diet and just they want to throw out, they are like you know purposely throwing out and again if they eat some additional sweets for making the diet and improper that is the reason they are throwing out again wantedly so is it permissible to do that? If there is no harm physically or medically on you, this is permissible but it's extravagance. Eating and vomiting is not known to be something human. Animals do it and it's a disease in some cows when they keep on eating and eating and eating until they die out of that. Dogs, the Prophet, Alayhis Salaam, told us that they eat and vomit and they may eat, they vomit back again but it is not known for human to eat until they're full or to eat when they want and desire some food and then they throw up so that they can consume more food. Audhu Billah. This is extravagance and something wrong in a person's mind or head. If it's done for a necessity, I overate and I don't feel comfortable and I want to make myself throw up so that I would relieve myself, yes, but to make this as a habit, no this is not permissible because of its extravagance and waste of money and Allah knows best."
