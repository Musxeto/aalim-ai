  "transcript": "Faiz from Singapore Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, can you explain the hadith in Sahih Bukhari that says when people came to Umar and asked him whether you can marry a Christian or a Jew then he says there is no difference between a Christian and a pagan or something like that? I don't know the hadith first of all and you may be referring to Ibn Umar not Umar who used to think that the Christians are not monotheistic, they're polytheists, they're idol worshippers and this is an offshoot opinion from all the scholars of the Companions and the Tabi'een and the Muslims as a whole and this does not discredit Abdullah Ibn Umar Ibn Khattab may Allah be pleased with him and with his father as he's one of the most learned and great scholars of the Companions as we know. But no one is perfect and this is why Allah tells us in the Qur'an فَإِن تَنَزَعْتُمْ If you were to dispute over an issue then refer it back to Allah and to the Messenger ﷺ meaning to the Qur'an, to the Sunnah. There are so many scholars around us, each one has his own opinion. We respect them all but we do not blindly follow any of them without cross-referencing whatever he says with the Qur'an and the Sunnah. One scholar says you have to recite the Fatiha every gathering. Why? Did the Prophet do it? No. Companions? No. Tabi'een? No. Tabi'at Tabi'een? No. So where did you get this? No this is bid'ah hasana. You think you are inventing shari'ah and this is an innovation. Oh Allah Azzawajal has given al-Fatiha and the last two verses of Surat al-Baqarah to the Prophet and an angel came with it and gave it to the Prophet ﷺ from underneath the throne, al-Arsh. He says okay, what does this mean? He says it means it's a great surah. I know it's the greatest surah in the Qur'an. What does that entail? He said then this we can read it in every gathering. This is a bid'ah. This is an innovation. Why don't you read the last two verses of Surat al-Baqarah because they came together as well. He said hmm, I never thought of that. Because you don't think. You blind follow those predecessors of yours. Follow Qur'an and Sunnah. Likewise, we honour Abdullah ibn Umar may Allah be pleased with him. But we follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah and Allah Azzawajal made marrying the people of the book, Christians and Jews, permissible for us. So no one can come and say no it's not permissible because Allah mentioned this in the Qur'an and the Prophet ﷺ in the authentic hadith and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
