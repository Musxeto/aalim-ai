  "transcript": "Salam Alaikum. Waleiha from India. I have a question. Our relative has taken Riba based loan, a gold loan. Now she wants her gold back because she don't want to deal in Riba but does not have full amount of money. Is it permissible for me to help her by providing some amount of money so that she gets her gold back by paying the Riba? And she promised to give my money back. Jazakallahu Khairan. If you're asking about lending her money and she's going to pay you back, this is permissible. If you're asking about assisting her, paying her Riba based interest, and the answer is no. You're not allowed to give from charity or from zakat to someone who's paying off his Riba based loan. Because this would be assisting them and encouraging them to do it over and over again. So many people say, my father took a mortgage on the house and now he's asking us to help him pay the installments. No, this is not permissible. Helping him, meaning that you're paying interest to the bank and he will take another loan as in many cases. I've seen in the UK and elsewhere where the father just keeps on buying houses on mortgages. And doesn't care, the sons will pay, people would give me from zakat. This is not permissible. But lending a particular individual money, whether they're going to pay their interest or they're going to buy something, it's no problem as long as they will pay it back."
