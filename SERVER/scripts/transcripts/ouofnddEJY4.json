  "transcript": "brother budget sent us a question saying how do normal Muslims know which ayat are mutashabihat how many ayat are obligated but exists in the Quran and are there any ayat abrogated and also do not exist in the Quran budget this requires a lecture and this is a Q&A series not a place for such structured knowledge we know that we have a science called illumine Quran the sciences of the Quran which deals about or deals with the Quran where it was revealed when it was revealed as baboon news all it deals with whether this ayah is murky or maddening and the definition of mckee or Madani is it related to place or where it was revealed or related to time before he died or after he drew regardless of the town but yet still we call it Mecca and Medina it deals with an man Seuk the abrogated verses of the Quran which he also asked about it deals with a lot of things that are mentioned in the Quran and a lot of it also is connected to o Sole elphaba fundamentals effect in terms of Allah will house Alma Alma pay yet and mu German will move us all all of these things that were studied in Isola Luke are also applicable to alumina Quran in totality and generality now we know that the verses of Quran are formed of Muhammad and mutashabihat and you're asking me how do people know about these things definitely laymen cannot know out of thin air about such things they must go back to the books of the seer to the scholars of Allison l-jamaa who learnt this from the three favorite generations of the Companions the terrain and the tabut a being so we know this by going back to their books and learning what is considered to be mutashabiha because some might consider the attributes of a large the oil to be much ashabi hot what areas of Allah and this is not true we know that this is makkah and it is solid strong and understood to all how it is this is something we don't know the nature but we understand and we believe what it means it's not something that is ambiguous in the sense that we don't understand it we know what it means we know what implies - and we believe it it without simulating it without saying that Allah so that is like this or interpreting it Allah is like that etc we believe in it as it is while believing that Allah is unlike anything we know of when it comes to abrogation a larger wijl reveals the verses of the Quran for a specific reason and some of these revelations may be abrogated and abrogated means abrogation is to uplift the ruling so a ruling comes a revelation comes that this is prohibited then it is abrogated and becomes permissible or it cut it for us it comes for something to say that this is permissible and then it abrogates it and makes it harm and the abrogation is divided into three types abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains and this is the vast majority of rulings so we know that the prohibition of consuming intoxicants we're given through three stages the first one Allah says that they ask you about wine and gambling intoxicants and gambling say that there is benefit in it and there is a lot of harm as well and the harm is far greater than the benefit so from being permissible the first rule is that it's best not to do it the second stage is when Allah says o who you believe do not approach do not offer prayer when you are intoxicated until you are aware of what you say so this prohibited the Muslims from being intoxicated at the times of prayers and this means that you can maybe get wasted after fajar because there are there's about six hours till for the following prayer or after isha especially in a winter when the night is long then the third prohibition came or the third level of abrogation came when Allah says that verily wine that is intoxicants macer gambling the idols with the things are slaughtered too as a sacrifice and drawing the lots all of these are a bundle of animation from Shaitaan so you have to refrain from it and this is total prohibition now these verses are mentioned in the Quran we recite them no one can come and say listen Allah says do not pray or approach prayer when you are in the city of intoxicants intoxication until you understand what you say so now after Isha I can get wasted because I don't have to pray Allah says in the Quran Oh ahi this was abrogated but the iron recitation remains as it is this is phase one phase two is when the verse was revealed it was abrogated from being recited so it's not there in the Quran anymore but the ruling remains as it is and scholars give an example for this by the authentic hadith in sahih bukhari and elsewhere where allah azza wajal says the Prophet said I assumed that Allah says if the son of Adam had a valley of gold he would acquire a second to it and if he had two valleys of gold he would acquire a third one to it and nothing fills the eye of the son of Adam nothing nothing fills the mouth of son of Adam nothing fills the stomach of son of Adam except dust so scholars say that this was a verse in the Quran but reciting it was abrogated and the ruling remains as it is so this is number two the third one is what was considered to be part of the Quran a verse of the Quran then the ruling was abrogated and reciting it was abrogated as well so it's not found in the Quran anymore and they give an example of the hadith of mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her she said it used to be part of the Quran that ten sucklings prohibit a child and he becomes the son of the woman who suckled him and this was abrogated into five so now we look at the ten you in the beginning if you circle a child ten meals ten times he becomes your son this was abrogated in two suckling the child five times so the ten now the ruling is abrogated okay let's look in the Quran do we find the ayah that mentions this the answer is no because that was abrogated as well from being recited so here we have the two types of abrogation the uplifting of the ruling and also the uplifting of the verse itself that it is does not exist how do we know this we can't know this okay we cannot open the Quran and say whom there's something abrogated here or there you have to go back to the hadith of the Prophet Ali salatu salam and to the sooner the books of sunnah that indicate to you that such an abrogation took place and you have to look into the books of tafseer you have to read the books of a nasa holman so you have to read the books on the sciences of the Quran and if you do this then you do not become a normal Muslim you become a student of knowledge and a large L knows best"
