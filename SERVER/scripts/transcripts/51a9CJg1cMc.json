  "transcript": "from india sheikh my question is that is it good practice to pray for raka at masjid and sunnaraka at home fajr is it a good practice to pray for drakka for me you're talking about general fart or particularly fajr no general okay i will answer inshallah stop from india he says is it sunnah to pray the sunnah prayer at home while praying the father in the masjid the answer is yes the prophet said do not make your homes graveyards pray in your home because we are not allowed to pray in graveyards you know that in cemeteries it's not permissible to pray so the prophet is telling us to pray in our homes and he said in another hadith which is all so authentic the best of a man's prayer is in his home except for prayers meaning that you should pray all sunnah in your home except the fall prayers you should pray them with the congregation and the masjid"
