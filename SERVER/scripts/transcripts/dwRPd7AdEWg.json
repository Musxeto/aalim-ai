  "title": "Rights of Islam are too much to me: Fortress of the Muslim (Part 4)",
  "transcript": "foreign oh prophet of allah the rights of islam are much for me so tell me of something that i might hold fast to what does it mean that the rights of islam are much for him he doesn't want to pray no the man is referring to voluntary acts like night prayer fasting voluntary fast giving charity he knows the pillars of islam and there is no compromise in any of that but what he's asking about is something to sum everything else up so the prophet said alaihis allah let not your tongue cease from the remembrance of allah now this is the english translation in arabic let your tongue be moist with the remembrance of allah and this is much more beautiful though may maybe the english speakers would not say moist it's always moist it's saliva in it so no no what was meant is that when you make vicar this is making your tongue moist in the sense that if you don't make thicker it becomes like a barren land that needs water that needs rain that needs cultivation but when you have your tongue moist by the diker of allah and how is that possible there's no problem in that i remember when i used to talk to sheikh bin baz like 30 years plus ago on the phone he had two landlines so when his assistant picked up the first line and the sheikh was answering a caller the second line line rang he picked it up the assistant and he says hold on for a second i used to hear the answering the call and after he hangs up by the time the assistant gives him the second headset i can hear the shaykh saying all that this is not once every single time he says just finished the caller and now you're taking another caller but he's always 24 7 remembering allah and the guy is dead so he's not going to give me a penny for praising him like that that and allah azzawajal is the protector and allah azza is the one who's holding him to account allah but this shows you how when zikr becomes in your blood when your tongue becomes moist with the remembrance of allah azzawajal you would be a different person compare this to our youngsters who all what they think of is music lyrics hip-hop rap and i've seen some of the youngsters memorizing rap songs and repeating the lyrics and if you ask them can you recite ayatul kurzi for me said huh they would not be able to do this so this is one of the downfalls that we have to look uh after inshaallah now the following hadith the prophet says whoever recites a letter of allah's book has for it a merit and ten more like it not to say that alif lam are one letter but rather alif is a letter lam is a letter and meme is a letter now this hadith shows you the abundance of allah's great rewards for remembering allah specifically for reciting the quran the prophet tells us that allah azzawajal rewards those who ever do such a thing that with each letter allah gives them one good deed one hasanah and this hasanah is multiplied tenfold and another hadith up to 700 folds and another hadith up to whatever allah pleases azza wajal so just so that there won't be any confusion the prophet alaihissalam elaborated he said watch out i don't say alif which is the beginning of like surat al-baqarah for example is one letter alif is a single letter lam is a single letter meme is a single letter which means that this is literal that allah gives reward without any account for those who remember him for those who read the quran and of course we know that the quran is the word of allah the almighty which is not created and that it is made of letters and sounds that we hear and that we recite and it also shows you how great the reward of allah azzawajal is now having said that it's important to know that the more muslims are engaged with their book that is the quran the better humans they are the closer to allah they are the greater the rewards with allah is and the better quality of life with lots of blessing in it they would have and again and again we find that the muslims have abandoned the quran let left it behind them neglected it they took up constitutions they took up um [Music] worldly laws and ideologies rather than accepting the quran to be the word of allah and to be their guide to the paradise of allah azzawajal the more we are distant from the quran the more allah humiliates us and makes us weaker and more vulnerable to enemies attacks but the more we are closer to the quran the better people we are the better muslims we are this is why the enemies of islam try their level best to segregate us to keep us as far as possible from the quran and preoccupy us with anything else other than the quran i pray to allah that he makes the quran the spring of our hearts and to expand our chest with it and he's capable of doing that i mean with this we come to the conclusion of today's episode until we meet next time i leave wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi [Music] foreign"
