  "transcript": "zeyneb says what is the ruling of 40 days postpartum for women who have given birth in India the mothers are confined to their homes for 40 days they are not allowed to go outside during this time and asked to follow certain rituals is there any authenticity to this the answer is no like most things that come to us from the subcontinent unfortunately maybe because they're mixing up with the Hindus and they tend to share a lot of their cultural things or religious maybe even but as Muslims and and don't think take don't be offended by this people say why are you always mentioning the subcontinent because there are almost the largest population of Muslims and we love them and we have to help them correct their wrong beliefs this is why what we're doing what we're doing to get closer to Allah so gel through the Quran discern and not through our culture whether it's from Saudi Arabia or from Egypt or from Jordan what counts is the Quran the Sunnah so when they can find women and their postnatal bleeding and they forbid them to leave this is baseless this has no authenticity none whatsoever even some of the female companions used to go in jihad while in this situation of postnatal bleeding or post or whatever they used to go for Hajj and there's no restriction on that so you can't be as they say more Roman than the Romans introducing things into Islam putting certain rituals the regarding bathing or going out or eating or meeting people all of these are baseless and do not relate to Islam none what so ever"
