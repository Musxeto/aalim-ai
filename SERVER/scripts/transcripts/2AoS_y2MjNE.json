  "title": "Can a woman stand outside the graveyard",
  "transcript": "okay fim from Bangladesh alaykum alikum she yesterday you mentioned that women are not permitted to visit graveyards however if a woman wants to send her son for visiting the grave of her husband and she stands outside of the graveyard let's say she is standing right behind the boundary wall of the graveyard and from there she cannot see her husband's grave clearly but can track the location of the grave and she intends to do this only once in her entire life so is this permissible no problem as long as she doesn't enter the graveyard there's no problem in that inshallah"
