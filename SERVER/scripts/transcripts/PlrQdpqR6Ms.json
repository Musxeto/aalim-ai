  "title": "Sinful friends or relatives / part ways or advise them? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says that he has relatives of his who are not steadfast on the deen so should he cut his relationship with them the answer is no as long as they're Muslims and as long as there is room for them to come back you should always think positive when there is a brother of mine who's sinful and I advise him and he continues to make the same I have one of two options either to buy caught him and never returned his Salaam and totally take him off my contact list or I should keep my distance but continue to talk to him send him SMSs exchange salams with him try my level best to give him the hour whenever it is appropriate the first scenario is valid if I have a strong and great impact on him that he would come back to Islam come back to practicing the religion because he loves me and this is very rare usually people would be negligent said so what the hell with him I don't want even to speak with him he doesn't want to talk to me I don't want to see his face and there are so many bad people outside to take them in so this approach is not very effective in all cases however being kind to them giving them dower every now and then helping them showing them that you are really keen on what helps them and you try your level best to benefit them in the best way possible this may in sha allah proved to be fruitful in the coming future and allah azzawajal knows best"
