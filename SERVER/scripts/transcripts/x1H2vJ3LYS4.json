  "title": "Can I pray behind an Imam who says Quranic Taweez is ok & arabic can be represented by numbers?",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing uh shihab from bangladesh sheikh the imam of our masjid said it is halal only if a tab is written by the verse of quran and hadees but he added that each arabic letter can be represented by a specific number so if we don't write the actual words rather we write the numbers which is representing the words then it is also parallel to where that tab is so can i pray behind this imam sheikh shihab didn't you ask me this question on my website yesterday that was i think a bit different question okay this was a similar question and the answer is no this is not permissible to be done saying that wearing tawith made only from quran is a weak opinion and some say that this is the opinion of abdullah ibrahim he pleased with him but this is not true and this is why we would not say that this is shirk we would say okay this is a weak opinion it's not permissible to add the hadith to it this is not permissible to go a little bit overboard and write numbers so saying letter a is for one letter w is for 15 and we put numbers this is what sooth sayers and magicians do so definitely if the imam does this you must not pray behind him and allah knows best you"
