  "transcript": "of his people. He wanted goodness for all of humanity. Yet, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, he would still have this human emotion of sorrow and grief. Imagine, his beloved uncle Abu Talib, who took care of him for over 40 years, shielded him, protected him, gave him a safe haven, and prevented the idol worshippers from attacking him. The Prophet relentlessly tried his level best that he accepts Islam, but it was Allah's will. When he died, he was grieved by it. Allah the Almighty comforted him by saying, Indeed, O Muhammad, you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. Full stop. End of sorrow and grief. Yes, I love my uncle, but if this is the will of Allah, there's nothing I could do."
