  "transcript": "Tea from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh this is not something I've asked you before but it might sound similar so I'm aware that we're allowed to do trade with non-Muslims whether we want to buy their products or if we run a business and we yeah we could do trade with them. Sheikh if we pay them money for buying their products or we set up a business that is not it is selling luxury goods and we're forced to return their money back to them. A lot of the non-Muslims they don't use any a lot of them don't use Sharia compliant banks so would we be assisting in sin if we were to like transfer money to their bank accounts and if they hold their money in the bank accounts obviously there's interest potentially that they may accumulate. Jazakallahu Khair. Wa Jazakum. It is not any of your concern and none of your business what they do with their own money. You borrowed money from an individual you took money to invest for an individual and you gave them back their capital or what you borrowed from them with interest that is with profit whatever they do with it it's their business whether they buy alcohol whether they invest it in haram interest riba based money whether they go and do heinous things with it that's their money you're not their mother and it's none of your business."
