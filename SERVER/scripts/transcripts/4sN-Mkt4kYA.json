  "transcript": "Sheikh the second question we have is how can I develop true khushu' in my prayer and build sincere lasting taqwa in my daily life so that my connection with Allah is not just a habit but something deeply felt and lived? JazakAllahu Khairan Sheikh. Well this is not a very easy question to answer because theoretically speaking this is dependent on your knowledge of Allah Azza Wa Jal. Whatever is to be able to stand in prayer without thinking except about who you're talking to, who you're praying to, who you're standing in front of and if you don't know Allah Azza Wa Jal that would be almost impossible. See the vast majority of people when they say Allahu Akbar they think about where did I park my car, oh my slippers are they in the box or outside would somebody steal them they're very expensive ones oh what did I do did I put my mobile in the car it's in my pocket so while in prayer they reach for their pocket okay where is the khushu' yeah I don't know shaitan came and just told me that the mobile is not in my pocket. Other than okay so I have to go to the grocery shop I have to go to the vegetable shop and get some okay my wife told me this and what rakah I'm in I don't know let me follow the one next to me whatever he does I'm gonna do so the salat finishes and the dude doesn't know what's happening so you ask him why are you doing this he said no no I'm trying to get khushu' for 20 years but I'm unable okay how many names of Allah do you know well I've heard that he has 99 names okay how many of them do you memorize um maybe 10 20 mashallah good of these 20 how many do you know the meaning of um maybe three or four so how do you expect to face Allah when you only know three or four of his names you have to learn Allah's beautiful names you have to know what is al-latif you have to know what is al-qadir you have to know what is al-aziz al-aziz everybody knows the word what does it mean 99% of the people who are watching say um uh uh okay good thank you this is problem when you read one of the shortest surahs that everybody knows what does ahad mean um pass what does assamad mean what do you mean assamad is one of Allah's names is it well this is the first time I know gosh I don't know so what do you expect how can you reach the level of taqwa if you don't even know who Allah is so you have to go to the basics what we are doing is looking for in public relations we call it the wow factor when you have a presentation you just look at the bullet points that when people hear this it wow so when I'm making a presentation well we've managed to be in 60 countries wow and we've managed to open x amount of masjids wow and we've done this with minimal amount of money these are the key points instead of talking for half an hour so nowadays all what we care about is the wow factor how many khatma you've done five in Ramadan wow how many umrah oh I go for umrah every three weeks wow how much money do you have how many cars do you have an SUV do you have a boat that we could go skiing do you have this do you have that but where is the beef where is the quality where is the essence zero inside it's hollow it's empty yes you may like my physique you might like my body my muscles my the way I look this woman is gorgeous she's a bombshell she's beautifully crazy what's inside nothing and that is why when they stand in prayer they don't know who's they're talking to that's why they're depressed they have panic and an anxiety attack that's why they're always lost that's why they're moody that's why some of them consider themselves to be bipolar and with with ups and downs and all of this because they don't know Allah so I can't answer your question about the salat and the khushu it's a full system that you need to transform your whole life in order to reach there that was quite an answer um sheikh do you have time for a few more questions yeah yeah I have nothing to do okay so I'm in shall I say"
