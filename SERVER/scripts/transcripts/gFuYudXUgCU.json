  "transcript": "Ultima from India I heard a scholar who says that women's education should not be encouraged as educating women would lead to the women trying to become leaders or try to attain a higher status than that of men is he right in what he says what are your comments Sheikh on this I can't comment on people's coats without hearing the full story now if I do some of the viewers may know who this chair is and they would immediately put it on YouTube is refuting Sheikh so and so and I didn't hear the whole story My Views are as follows I have 13 girls with the grace of Allah all of them are educated and uh uh one of them is on her PhD and two or three are doing Masters and the rest are all Bachelor degrees and different Sciences alhamdulillah so I think this shows you there is nothing wrong in teaching women what's wrong and what happens afterwards yes if you come to me and say oh we support the education of women I said my hand is with you I'm all for that and you say in order to do that we have to have them studying in mixed classes whoop sorry no can do they have to take off their hijab no can do they have to participate in sports in front of men what are you you're a Muslim what is this we have to send them off to non-muslim countries without mahram and they would mix with men and then they'll take their no no wait wait wait wait wait wait wait we are fully supporting women to reach the highest levels in Academia without any problem providing the Sharia is implemented and this is not only for women it's only for men if you're going to say to me we want men to pursue their higher educations I'm all for that but this means that they have to compromise their religion they have to shave their beards they have to go into uh Haram and they have to involve in Haram and study Haram said wait wait wait their priority my priority is religion if this is going to be compromised I will stop but to come and like some uh regimes would say no for education for women period they do not go to high school they do not go to to college even if it's segregated even if it's under Sharia alone this is stupid with all due respect any because they are tarnishing the reputation of Islam by that I'm not judging but I'm telling you what the stance of Islam is there's no problem in women studying but only according to the boundaries of sharia as well as men there's no problem of them studying according to the boundaries of sharia but to come and break and twist the rules and regulations of Islam for the sake of Education no education comes second Islam comes first and Allah Knows Best foreign"
