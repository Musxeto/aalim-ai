  "title": "Some people conclude funeral prayer with 2 Salams, is this correct? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay he says some people when they perform funeral prayers they do with two salams rather than one please shed some light on it this is an issue of dispute among schools of thought and we've said before that if you are praying behind the hanafi school of thought and he does a salaam to the left this is permissible and uh though it's against the sunnah but there's no problem in it insha allah if one does it"
