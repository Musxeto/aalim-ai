  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah and welcome to this first class studying a very important topic in our whole curriculum for seeking knowledge and enriching our information about the religion of Islam the first important aspect of knowledge that each and every individual of us must know is that there will be questions in the grave and these are the three principal fundamentals and before you start looking at one another what is this are we in the uh uh um wrong class no you are in the right class this is the S of the prophet Al but what is the importance of studying s why do we have to know about our Prophet Muhammad wasam well simply because there will be three fundamental questions asked in the graves and without answering them you would have failed miserably and these questions are who are who is your lord what is your religion and who is this man who was sent to you so the importance of studying the S is that we learn about the prophet and know everything that revolved around him as this is an essential part of our religion whether it's in the pillars of is Islam to believe and testify or in the pillars of Iman to know the messengers of Allah so the importance of studying the S lies in the fact that everything that happened in his lifeam was documented and this did not happen to any individual on Earth ever and it will never happen to any individual on Earth till the day of judgment and this is a miraculous thing it's not something to be taken lightly to know everything in his life whether done in public or in private and to be documented and for all all to agree upon except for very minute differences this is a a miracle by itself and why if it was sufficient Allah would have given each one of us a copy of the Quran but that wasn't sufficient we had to see the Quran being implemented in the lifetime of the prophet am a role model a living example that this is doable that we can do this humans can do this so when you study the S you know that this is how you interpret the Quran it is important to study the S because it gives you a holistic and detailed example of different branches of Sciences of Islam Quran everything was done by himam and Allah had sent the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam as our Benchmark he's the measuring stick that we know and evaluate things through so by studying his you know how to react when events take place in your life whether through your marriage through bringing up your children through your own personal hygiene how to sleep how to speak how to walk how to act with different categories of the society whether Muslims or non-muslims whether reverts or righteous practicing Muslims or Sinners and the likes all of this is detailed in his s and when we study this we understand it more and more some of the advantages of studying this is that those of us who were unfortunate to meet the prophet Alat and to be with him to be around him get this chance when they study the of the Prophet wasam so they read it and feel that they're living and that they are being with himam as if they can see him Abdullah Mubarak one of the great Scholars of Islam used to be asked by his students and friends why don't you sit with us after Isa prayer why do you retire to your quarters he said what would I do with you I go and sit with the prophet and with the companions meaning that he goes and studies the Hadith and the and the biography of the prophet and part of studying the sir is that it gives you an Insight how this best generation ever to have lived the generation of the the prophet Alam and of his companions how they lived how they behaved who were they you get a deep look into his closest companions the 10 heavenbound Abu Bakr Omar Ali abdb and the likes you get to know them closely you get to know their personalities and how they behaved and how they Rose and fell as great men human beings but of the highest caliber possible once you get to know this you get closer to Allah Asel and and you get to love the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and this is a very crucial point in our Islam the masses around us of Muslims tend to be oblivious of the importance of loving the prophet Alat wasam to the extent that lots of the kids don't know him hence they don't love him and this is a grave sin it can negatively impact one's life one's Iman the prophet saidat one of you would not attain IM until I that is the prophet Alam become more beloved to him than his parents his wife his children and the whole of humanity even his own his own self so you would won't reach this Perfection of Iman until you manage to love the prophet wasam more than anything else again it is extremely important to have knowledge of the SE and it is as important to learn the s from trusted sources and if you look around the vast majority of Muslims and the vast majority of people nowadays take their knowledge through untrusted sources social media Tik Tok Facebook and the likes yes there are some of these sources that can be trusted but they're very negligible compared to the huge amount of lies and fabrications that we have and this goes to the S of the Prophet as well and this is why Scholars have spent a lot of time filtering the biography of the Prophet Alat wasam trying their level best that only the cream and the pure substances reach us as we know there are in Arabic many books that may not qualify to this high level of authenticity such as the book known as Alani for Abu or for andeli these books are storytelling type of books and as every story or novel there has to be a plot and they have to add some dramatic tales and fabrications and lies and if you scrutinize and look deep you will find that there are lots of Liars who hate the Sunnah and who tend to put Fabrications against some of the companions may Allah be pleased with them all to serve their own personal Vendetta and hidden agenda by tarnishing the reputation of mother AA or this companion or that companion this is why we have to take our Knowledge from trusted people it's not the degree that counts it is the knowledge of the individual the religious commitment of the individual that we're learning from and alhamdulillah there are many books in Arabic again that are trustworthy and we can learn from them how the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam lived how he dealt with those who were close to him and those who were far how he communicated how he taught his religion as he was our Mentor he was our teacher and of course in the recent times we have books like of drar and we have how he treated them of Muhammad Alid and other books that try their level best not to mention except what is authentic having said that there are books like a of IB ish which is a renowned book since centuries though it may contain some weak narrations or fabricated narrations but they are few and the scholars have accepted the vast majority of the book because they tend to be a bit lenient when it comes to compared to issues related to or to or to because these things are related to practical issues in our religion or things that are related to our conviction and belief so they tend to be more strict in applying the rules and regulations of Hadith that only authentic orass is accepted rather than applying it to issues of that are closer to history than to and uh uh and the likes so I hope inshallah this course would be beneficial in getting us to learn more about the prophet and how he lived so that we can find it easy for us to relate to him to love him and to implement his Sunnah the way we should and Allah Knows [Music] Best for in"
