  "transcript": "and Rashad from the UAE uh if the government prohibits one from taking private coaching classes unless unless they have an official permit or so but if the ones which have the permit are very expensive and not in our budget can we offer the former since they are uh really since we really require help in our studies okay I will answer inshallah finally Rashad says the government mandated laws that would prevent a private tuition and courses that are not um conducted in official places or at least at licensed places and these licensed places and institutions are so expensive would it be sinful for me to apply for something cheap if it's not Haram and you're willing to bear the consequences when caught red-handed meaning paying the fine or whatever they uh um May judge against you there's no problem with that you're not doing something Haram yes you're disobeying the laws of the country but this is a felony that can be compensated with a fine like when I exceed the speed limit when it's 50 miles per hour and I do 70. I may get a ticket but did I do a sin I have to prostrate two prostrations of forgetfulness no I broke the law I disobeyed the laws that but that is compensated with money as long as I don't jeopardize people's lives and I don't endanger others or cause more harm than Allah Knows Best [Music] all right and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign"
