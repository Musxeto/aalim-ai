  "transcript": "it's not a time for prayer and a person goes and answers the call of nature and soon afterwards he finds himself washing his left foot and he looks in the mirror and founds he finds that he had already performed woudl now it is not time for prayer to perform Moodle and he did not intend to perform Moodle rather it is an automatic reaction to whenever he answers the call of nature so can he pray with that what would answer is no because this was not intended it's different to someone healing the event or wanting to go to the message it and he goes to the toilet to answer the call of nature and to make Waddell house his intention was done he doesn't say anything verbally or he doesn't need to think about it because this is what she's going to do and he already thought about it unlike our friend in the first scenario"
