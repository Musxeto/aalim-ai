  "transcript": "Munir from India. Munir. Wa'alaykumussalam wa'rahmatullahi wa barakatu. Sheikh, actually my question is the person who like does the bid'ah, like asking for wasila or going to dargah and so on. So shall I be in connect with him, like even if he is my relative, like shall I follow what he says? First of all, the bid'ah is divided into two types. Bid'ah that takes you out of the fold of Islam and bid'ah that is a major sin and does not take you out of the fold of Islam. The latter is much less dangerous. So someone who celebrates the mawlid for example, it's a bid'ah. This takes you out of the fold of Islam. So with those who do this lesser bid'ah, yes you can be in contact with them, try your level best to give them da'wah while not participating in their innovation or endorsing it or turning a blind eye whenever they open the subject. You have to address it. Those who do things that take them out of the fold of Islam, you may give them da'wah, you may remind them of Allah, but if you see that they're adamant and defiant, they don't want to listen, you have to cut them off and leave them even if they are your relatives. you"
