  "transcript": "an anonymous question says that kids these days are becoming increasingly impatient and short-tempered and they do not hesitate to say really bad and hurtful things to their parents is this one of the signs of the Day of Judgment the answer is no this is a sign of misbehaving this is a sign of the parents not doing their job properly this is a sign of spoiling our children beyond control to an to a level that we cannot control them there are so many factors there is the impact of media TV movies soap operas on the children the impact of social media Instagram snapchat the the the YouTube etc and the lack of quality time when you're unable to sit with your child for an hour or two every day give them quality time listen to them instead of just lecturing them try to figure out how they think who they hang out with and try to give them advice with love and compassion to Reese tear their ship on the right course every now and then if you fail to do this this is what you get you pay peanuts you get monkeys but you have to invest more and more and make a lot of duaa because at the end of the day guidance is at the hands of Allah you must not tolerate disrespect in any form or shape he's young he doesn't understand he is 25 years of age and he disrespects you he's disrespected his mother or father this is a red line that you cannot allow such a person to cross and you have to take real drastic measures to vent it from happening again and there are a number of reasons a number of ways to do this but this is not the time for it may Allah guide our children to the right path honey rider says our house so basically their parents had a house and it was burnt to the ground so her brother or her sister built a new house and was huge on it and they were a wealthy family so they lived there for a while and all of a sudden they lost everything they lost their wealth a servant stole their golden and savings etc so now they want to sell the house in a cheap price and she and her husband are thinking of buying it but they're afraid of the house being bad luck so Wood saying bismillah when entering the house be sufficient from getting rid of it's bad luck first of all we do not believe in bad omens Muslims do not believe in bad omens we believe in good omens and being optimistic but thinking that this is jinx is not part of our religion there is a hadith where the Prophet said that is awesome if bad omens existed it would have been in the woman the wife in the house and in the horse the right but this is a big if if it existed and the Prophet told us our salatu salam that believing in bad omens is shirk and we Muslims do not believe in bad omens and in another hadith whoever is prevented from moving forward due to bad omen he has committed shirk and if it did not prevent him he went on then he is not in the state of shirk so how do we understand the hadith the Prophet said in another hadith re social that happiness meaning worldly happiness not eternal worldly happiness happiness is in for it's in your house it's in your spouse it's in your right and it's in your neighbor so whoever has good for things in his life he's a happy man so what do we or how do we understand if there were bad omens they would be in the woman in the house and in the horse we would understand this as explained in another hadith bad omen of a a woman is when she speaks ill about the husband she swears and nags and shouts and abuses his parents and his family so this is the bad omen of a woman if she had these characteristics in her and in the house to be narrow and small rooms and not spacious and in the horse and not being obedient not being cooperative like if you buy a car and it breaks every now and then then this if there were to be bad omens in it this is what is considered to be a bad omen so going back to your question the house is a house if you recite in in Surat al-baqarah once this kicks the Shaitaan out and if you recite every three nights the last two ayahs of surah Baqarah amina rasool woman's irredeemable moon it kicks the Shaitaan away for three nights so you recite it every single night part of the earth car of going to bed but that would suffice you insha'Allah go ahead and buy the house and do not even blink thinking about bad omens or any of this nonsense and insha'Allah you will find it to be a good place to live in"
