  "transcript": "Noohan from Bangladesh. If someone works as a shopkeeper or in a showroom in a Muslim country and the masjid is very near to him, he can hear the adhan but the owner wants him to pray in the shop with other workers and doesn't allow him to go to the masjid. So will he be sinful for not praying in the masjid? And is the owner sinful for not giving him permission to go to the masjid? Keeping in mind that unfortunately most customers come in when it's time for congregation. Jazakallahu Khairan. Wa Jazak. Alhamdulillah Azza Wa Jal. There is room in our religion and there is freedom in our religion. In an authentic hadith, the Prophet ï·º said that a man's prayer in his masjid is better than his prayer in his souk, in his shop, in his marketplace. And of course his prayer in his marketplace is better than his prayer in his home. So with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal, if there is a congregation in the shop or in the mall or in the company and there is hardship or difficulty or restriction from praying in the masjid, alhamdulillah there is no sin at all in praying with the congregation with the grace of Allah and Allah knows best."
