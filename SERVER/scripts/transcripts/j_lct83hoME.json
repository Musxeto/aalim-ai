  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum I didn't quite finish when I asked now, so if I wear it with a towel it's okay but now what if I doubt whether it's on a plate or not, like if I see a plate and then I don't see any nutmeg on there but maybe it has been used, maybe it has been used, maybe there's 0.1 grams left on it, can I use the plate or do I say by default there's nothing on there or do I say when I see nothing it's okay? Maybe must be thrown in the dustbin. Words of doubt such as maybe, perhaps, I think, I feel, these are words or phrases of doubt. We take them and throw them in the dustbin because if you open the door for maybe, you'll destroy your life. Maybe your mother who you kiss and hug every morning is not your biological mother. Maybe the water you're drinking a lizard took a dip in it and came out and it's all contaminated. So no, Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity. Something you don't see, something you don't have traces of, you can move on and assume that it is pure and Allah knows best."
