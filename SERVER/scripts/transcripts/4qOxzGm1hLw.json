  "transcript": "Ayaan from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. There's a popular blocky game called Minecraft and in this game you can eat haram food such as pork and also there is witches and potions. Also in the game if you get a high enough level you can use your love levels to get a random enchantment and some enchantments are better than the other and you also lose your level in the progress. However the game is not realistic. Is playing this game permissible? I believe that such games are not permissible. Lots of people say that Sheikh these are only games. I said yes it contains kufr, it contains shirk, it contains magic, it contains sinful things and it's just okay. Might as well watch pornography. It's not real. This is not the right way of looking at things. These things negatively impact your heart. It hardens it. It makes it black and tarnishes it. So that in real life when you're exposed to similar sins you would have no problem in doing it and this is why I say no there are thousands of halal games out there. Why choose this? As a Muslim you have to choose and choose wisely because this may impact your time spent in your grave and on the day of judgment. Allah knows best."
