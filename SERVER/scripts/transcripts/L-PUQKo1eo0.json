  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam Sheikh in our free mix country It's a common thing that we invite relatives including non-Maharams to our house for a lunch and we also visit them for similar purpose And during summer or winter vacation, we all used to gather at grandpa's house for three four days So when we stay for such a few days teachers normally take place with non-Maharams too and we are taught by society that we should look at our cousins as siblings our Non-Maharam uncles and aunts as like fathers and mothers. That's why we don't mind mixing But now I know that Allah is unpleasant with us So the question is since segregation will not happen overnight, even if I advise them How can I uphold kinship if I don't invite relatives or gather at the grandparents house during vacation? Akhi What you must adhere to is the rulings of Sharia Regardless of the customs and traditions and what the people are accustomed to So what pleases Allah you do and what pleases Satan you stay away from so You have no Room to maneuver. It's simply drawing a red line and not crossing it Whoever is happy and pleased good for them Whoever is angry and upset tough luck Because I'm not willing to throw myself in hellfire Just to please the others. This is the ruling of Allah So what do you want me to do? Change it just to please you. I'm not going to do any of this so you have to clarify it to people that this is haram and Whenever you want to visit them visit them in other than these mixed occasions Like in Eid for example, if you visit them, you'll find everyone is mixed. So don't visit them on Eid Visit each household your uncle your aunts alone on separate Occasions when there's no one else visiting so that you can limit such free mixing and when you invite them invite them one By one and if they complain and object tell them you would like me to invite you all I would be more than happy But we have to segregate Mahrams from non-mahrams and then we would be complying with the Sharia and Allah knows best"
