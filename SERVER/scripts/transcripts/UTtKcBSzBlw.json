  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah I might be wrong but being a Muslim sometimes I feel there are many controversial and sentimental issues that distract our minds we get furious at those and spend our time and energy in protest end of the day due to lack of knowledge and productivity we Muslims often get exploited Sheikh sometimes is it better to shrug off all those things and consciously choose to focus on our work ethics so that we Muslims can be influential contributors in technology science theology I mean what does Islam advise us between dealing such situations Jazakallah Is this artificial intelligence or were you talking? How would I know Akhi what you have just stated? Usually they say 60 words per minute from typing but not in speaking Akhi when you ask a question you have to be clear so that you get a clear answer and when you speak 60 miles per minute I can't understand exactly what you said especially in my old age and my lack of my low IQ nevertheless you as a Muslim are supposed to have conviction certainty belief without any doubt if you get doubts and you as you've stated I am having doubts whether this is right with if these doubts are related to religion and you're doubting whether this is the true religion or not whether this is correct Quran or Allah exists you're not a Muslim let's not beat around the bush there is a difference if you're doubtful on the ruling of a man marrying four women and you would like to clarify this you know it's from Sharia it's in the Quran but I don't understand can you explain you go to the Sheikh he explains it to you you go to the Sheikh and say I don't understand why should I get my portion of inheritance and my sister gets half of it and the Sheikh would explain it so that you would understand and have conviction of it but when you come to the fundamentals of Islam of the existence of heaven and hell if you say that I don't know about the angels I don't see them so I don't have belief in them you're a kafir don't beat around the bush you're not a Muslim if you don't believe in the existence of jinn the existence of devils the existence of Satan the existence of the day of judgment the passing over the Sirat the presence of the scale on the day all of these things are basics so you have to differentiate between doubts that are due to lack of knowledge come to us we clarify it for you and now you're a proper Muslim and there are doubts that are against the essentials of Islam and this definitely takes a person out the fold of Islam so even if he ignores such doubts on the deathbed people would come and say say la ilaha illallah I said I can't I don't know is this true or not and he will die as a kafir may Allah protect us all"
