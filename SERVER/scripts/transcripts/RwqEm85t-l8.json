  "title": "Is it Kufr if I think there are methods to cure illnesses OTHER than what the Prophet ﷺ mentioned?",
  "transcript": "We have Ahmed from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. I hope you are fine. Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen. Sheikh, from past 2-3 months I am in great dilemma because I think I am a kafir because of the whispers. I think because there are some traditional methods of curing diseases told by our Prophet ﷺ. Like diseases like pneumonia and others. But if I believe that there were methods told by our Prophet centuries ago. And if I say that some methods are not applicable nowadays in many regions. And if I believe that all methods should be backed by doctors and some medical researches which are told by our Prophet. Am I committing kufr? No, you are not committing kufr unless you are opposing the Prophet ﷺ and rejecting what he has said. Sometimes the Prophet would direct us to use honey. And this is mentioned in the Qur'an. If someone says no, honey is not good, honey is not a medicine, honey cannot be consumed or used as medicine at all. And he acknowledges that this is found in the Qur'an and the authentic sunnah. This is a pure kafir. There is no doubt in that. He is rejecting something known from religion by default. But if he says that honey is not valid for all illnesses. Yes, it's good for many illnesses but there are certain illnesses that we cannot use honey for that. This is totally fine and legit. So it all depends on your conviction. If you are rejecting the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ as if he does not know or as if it's inapplicable or as if it's unscientific. Then there is a problem with your iman. But if you acknowledge the hadith and its authenticity and that it works in most cases. But there are cases that it may not work with or we may not know the ingredients and the dosages it should be consumed through. Then there is nothing wrong in that. Allah knows best."
