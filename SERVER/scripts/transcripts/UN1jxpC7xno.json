  "transcript": "Hammet says I'm a teenager and I have been getting overwhelmed with sexual thoughts what do I do because I'm afraid it will lead to sinful things well Hamid may Allah help you you live in difficult times indeed and lowering your gaze has not been more difficult than today where you have social media when you have TV screens everywhere when you have people not abiding by the proper attire when you have TV newspapers magazines social media YouTube snapchat Instagram you name it it's always there so it is difficult but whenever Allah guides someone then he has prospered and he's guided so in order to get Allah's guidance you have to help yourself first one by making a lot of dua so if you look at the prophets Allah saw some life the vast majority of his dua would be revolving on seeking Allah's guidance to be steadfast ya malleable Club that bit will be added Enoch or Turner of hearts make my heart steadfast on your religion make a lot of door because only Allah can help you only Allah can make us that fast Victorian sujood between a van and a parma in the last third of the night that Allah would protect you secondly take the necessary means to block these thoughts from invading your heart and that is one by lowering your gaze to by cutting and blocking all means that would introduce such images because these sexual desires and thoughts only creep in when you open your heart through looking at haram things so the more haram you look at the more corrupt your heart is and the thoughts would reproduce block the means lower your gaze do not get involved with looking at beautiful women pornography watching movies soap operas all of this is Haram even watching the news if the news anchor is a beautiful woman or you will see beautiful images here or there block it you have to fight these desires and thoughts that you get so you do not contemplate and ponder upon them you have to try and fast every alternate day so that fasting would give you a boost of Eman and would help you to lower your gaze as the prophet alayhi salat Sam had instructed the youth to do and finally these are just random thoughts you have to preoccupy yourself with good things when you surround yourself 24/7 with righteous Muslims who would help you to attend lectures to attend circles of knowledge to memorize the Quran to revise the Quran to go and do beneficial and good things this would narrow down the passages of the devil of Shaitaan of these desires and thoughts from investing in your head so by occupying yourself with righteous good things you would eliminate the room for bad thoughts and desires to come in and I pray to Allah Allah that he protects you and all the youth from falling under such thoughts and to protect you from haram by engaging in halal activities and getting married as soon as possible"
