  "title": "Shower or Bath in Afternoon Breaks the Fast? Assimalhakeem JAL ï¿¼",
  "transcript": "And finally, Rishma says, can we take a shower in the afternoon or evening while we are fasting? Someone said, when we take bath in the afternoon, our fast will break. This is a baseless, false, blatant lie. The companions, may Allah be pleased with them, during the day time of Ramadan, when they traveled, or when it was hot, they used to take a bath, or we used to swim, and having no problem or impact on their fasting. And as Muslims, we know that the things that break your fasting are numbered. So, anything else out of these nullifiers of fasting are to be ignored. So you can take a shower, you can swim, you can play sports, you haven't consumed anything, you haven't done anything that breaks your fasting, so don't listen to such baseless allegations."
