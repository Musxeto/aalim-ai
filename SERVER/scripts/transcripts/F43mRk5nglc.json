  "transcript": "now generally speaking normal \nhusbands give an open permission Iqra says does a wife need her husband's \npermission every time she steps out of the   house what if the husband is out of town must \nshe call him every time to take his permission.   The General trend is that a woman must deal with \nher husband with respect and obedience because   this is what will admit her to Jannah the prophet \nsaid four things if a woman succeeds in doing   them she will enter Jannah if she prays her fard \nprayers the five daily prayers fasts her Ramadan   protects her chastity and obeys her husband \nshe will enter Paradise from any gate she wants   and this by itself is nothing compared to what \nmen have to do in order to qualify to enter Jannah   so we think but it indeed it's a heavy burden \nand a great task for women to undertake and   this is their test in this life in the \nauthentic Hadith in the incident of Ifk   where the Hypocrites slandered mother Aisha \nin the long Hadith in bukhari and elsewhere   when she discovered what they were \nplotting and saying behind her back   she felt sick but she said o prophet of \nAllah do you permit me to visit my parents   this the scholars say is a clear indication \nthat a woman must not leave her house without   the permission of her husband now generally \nspeaking normal husbands give an open permission   I give my wife an open permission to leave \nwhatever she wants to go wherever she wants   because I trust her I have no problem with that \nhowever my wife till date does not go without   informing me I'm going to my mom's house I'm going \nto do this or that I'm going to visit a friend   and I say you don't have to say to that to \nme she said no I feel it's my obligation   and this is normal but if the husband insists \nin this case yes you have to seek his permission   having said that some men exaggerate and \nthey make their wives live in a prison   so they totally forced them to boycott their \nfamily don't go and visit your parents you're not   allowed to see your siblings you're not allowed \nto go out and the woman feels suffocated now in   so many cases such relationships end up in divorce \nbut after it's too late like after 20 years or so   this is due to the woman being too submissive \nyes you're obliged to obey him but there is a   limit when the man seeds logic and rationale and \nhe insists your gold that your parents gave you   that my family gave you that your friends gave you \nyou have to give it to me I'll keep it with my mom   and she complies are you nuts why would you \ngive it to him oh here's my husband Sheikh   so what he does not have any right \nover your financial possessions say no   or he may threaten me to divorce the hell with him so what it's better to live with dignity \nand honor and set the record straight   with this man instead of \nhim using you as a doormat   yes you are obliged to obey him to honor him to be \ndutiful to him but he is not allowed to transgress   so your financial accounts I need your \nATM I have to know the password show me   your mobile show me your passcode show \nme your emails tell me the passwords why   you make him wipe his feet every time he enters \nthe door because you're a doormat you deserve what   you get draw the line and tell them listen hun \nwe're a husband and wife I'm obliged to obey you   but you're obliged to respect me and to treat \nme like a woman not like a servant or a Slave   and unfortunately we have an imbalance and this \nimbalance causes a lot of such problems so to come   to answer your question yes you have to ask him \nfor permission but also you have to analyze and   see how the relationship is going so \nthat you can evaluate your marriage"
