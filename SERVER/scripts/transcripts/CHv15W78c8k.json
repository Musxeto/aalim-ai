  "transcript": "[Questioner] says is it permissible to giveÂ \nZakat to charity organisations that get reliefÂ Â  funds where they provide calamity strickenÂ \npeople with food or clothes, this isÂ Â  an issue of dispute, the default is thatÂ \nwe must give the poor Zakat money in cash,Â Â  and they decide whether they want to buy medicine,Â \nor pay the rent, or pay their bills, or buy food,Â Â  this is up to them not to our preference, it'sÂ \nnot for us to have the Zakat money and say,Â Â  okay this poor family needs clothes, we'll buyÂ \nthem clothes, maybe they need something else,Â Â  so it's not my preference, the default isÂ \nI have to give it to them in cash, howeverÂ Â  some scholars like Sheikh Ibn BazÂ \nmay Allah have mercy on his soul sayÂ Â  that it is permissible to give them itemsÂ \nthat are not cash such as food or clothes,Â Â  and it seems to me and Allah knows best andÂ \nthis is my own opinion that giving it toÂ Â  charity organisations as Zakat that weÂ \ntrust, and we know that they'll buy food,Â Â  clothes and whatever the poor and calamityÂ \nstruck areas people need, and they're Muslims,Â Â  and they're deserving, if we trust them IÂ \nbelieve that this is permissible becauseÂ Â  it is not feasible nor practical to go to suchÂ \nareas that was for example flooded with floodsÂ Â  and give them cash money to go and buyÂ \nfood, for them that would be more burdensomeÂ Â  to know where to get the food, and they'llÂ \nget it with much higher prices so the vastÂ Â  majority of them would authorise theseÂ \ncharity organisations to just get usÂ Â  anything, food, water, clothes, shelter, whateverÂ \nwe need all of this, and you have full authorityÂ Â  to do that and by doing this they can buy it asÂ \na wholesale cheaper, and they can provide thisÂ Â  service to the needy and the poor in a betterÂ \nconvenient way and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
