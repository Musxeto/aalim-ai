  "transcript": "Mu'izz from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I wanted to ask regarding moving to a non-Muslim country. I've moved to a non-Muslim country for studies and wanting to stay there after graduation because of following but not limited to factors. There is significant amount of free mixing in my family and friends and gathering that I can't deny to when I'm with them. Former friends circle is not practicing and enjoys free mixing. I know I felt increase in Iman when I'm in this non-Muslim country. I just wanted to have advice from you if it's a good way to do it or should I move back because I don't want to tarnish my relationship with my family. I can tarnish my relationship with the friends but it's family that I'm worried about. Thank you. JazakAllah Khair. JazakAllah Khair. Ufiq Barakallah. Akhi, every one of us is being tested on this earth. And no one lives a life without trials and tribulations and tests from Allah. No one. So your test is in standing firm, abiding by Sharia laws, and trying your level best to give da'wah to your family and to your friends. Running away is not a solution. And definitely living in a non-Muslim country is not a solution even if you feel temporarily that your Iman is increasing. Nevertheless, according to Sharia, you're sinful because the Prophet ﷺ ordered the Muslims not to live among the disbelievers. So if you go there to study, this is a legitimate reason. If you stay behind for a specific period of time to work and gain more experience or to make money, this is again a legitimate reason. But to settle there and to acquire their citizenship, this is not permissible for a Muslim who lives in a Muslim country. So you have to do your level best to finish and to get whatever experience you need and collect money and save money as much as you require and go back to your country where you can get married and settle down. If you face problems with remixing with the relatives, you have to draw the line. You cannot force them to drag you to do sin or to compromise your religion. Imagine what would the Prophet had done ﷺ. What would the Prophet have done when faced with such situations? Because this is exactly what happened. He called his tribe, his family, his loved ones, his relatives to Islam and they shunned him and they rejected his da'wah. He did not concave upon himself and retreated. Rather, he confronted them and he kept doing da'wah for 13 years despite the harassment, the physical and mental abuse, the torturing of his companions until Allah allowed him to migrate to Medina and we know the story, how the story goes from there. So you have to put yourself in his shoes and go back and give da'wah and be patient and tolerant. But hold your grounds and stand firm on your beliefs. Bad company, bad friends, you can ditch them. You don't need them. You can make new, practicing, righteous friends. Make them hang out with you, be surrounded by them 24 hours, 7 days a week and then inshallah things would go to the best, bi-idhnillah."
