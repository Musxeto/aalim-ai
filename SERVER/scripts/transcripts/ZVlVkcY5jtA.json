  "transcript": "chapter that deals with the eclipse prayer in arabic kusuf is linguistically used with the sun and is linguistically used with the moon and it can be swapped what is to be done when the sun or the moon is eclipsed this is what we will finish in this hadith hadith number 146. reported that there was a solar eclipse during the lifetime of the messenger of allah and he sent the announcer to summon them for congregational prayer the people gathered together and he pronounced the beer saying allahu akbar and he observed four rakaas bowing in the form of two and four such is describing to us a format of prayer that is different than all other prayers and the hadith in sahih muslim so it is the highest grade of authenticity how is that the prophet said alaihis allah instructing one of his companions to call for salatu unlike aid we said read that you do not call for you have to call the people by saying meaning come and gather for prayer why is that because the eclipse is something that people usually do not pay attention to imagine the eclipse happening at 11 o'clock p.m and you're in doors since maghrib so how would you know that there is an eclipse unless someone calls you to it unlike eighth prayer everybody knows that today's eight after fajr we all go to the musa so he instructed someone to call for the prayer once they gathered he played four raka's in two raka's with four prostrations what is this is it a puzzle no four raka's in two raka's meaning four raka's four bowing and two units so as if you're praying fajr prayer how many units do we have two how many rakaas do we have two how many stages do we have four in eclipse prayer we have two units with four raka's and four prostrations how it is to be performed as follows you give the beard you recite the fatiha you recite a very very long surah and then you bow and you prolong your bowing and then you say allah then you recite the fatih again and you recite the surah that is long but shorter than the first one and then you bow and you say straight two prostrations and you stand for the second unit you recite the fatih for the third time with the surah shorter than the previous two you bow you say something you recite the fatiha for the fourth time you cite the surah shorter and then you complete your prayer like usual now a lot of the brothers ask sheikh i went to the masjid and i found them in the first rakah but in the second raka of the first raka meaning that the imam recited the surah and the fatiha bowed and now he's reciting or not you get the point the scholars say no it is not because the first rakah is the pillar the second bowing in the first rakah is a sunnah so the first one if you did not pray it with your imam this means that after you conclude the prayer after the imam concludes the prayer you stand up and offering to raka's in one unit under allah okay"
