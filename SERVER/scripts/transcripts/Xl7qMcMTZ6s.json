  "title": "How to explain abrogated verses in the Quran, Asking for justification or using one's own logic?",
  "transcript": "brother hamza from bosnia uh sheikh what is the best way to explain to ignorant people what is the wisdom behind abrogate verses of the quran first of all it is important that we try our level best to introduce islam as a religion of submission belief and conviction because when we introduce islam as logic and something that you can figure it out for yourself this strips islam from a great deal of its value where it shows that you're a believer when you claim that you obey your father and allah has the highest example of course or you obey your boss and whenever he tells you to do something he ask you ask for justification and to understand and to be convinced this obedience is not obsolete or absolute it is not full compliance and obedience because you had set a condition now allah has an example of course we as muslims we submit and we believe and this is exactly why abu bakr may allah be pleased with him was called when people came to him and he's they said to him didn't you hear what your friend really referring to the prophet hassam didn't you hear what he said yesterday he said that and he claimed that he traveled from makkah to jerusalem and then ascended to the seventh heaven and then came back to jerusalem and came back to makkah in less than one night abu bakr said i believe him no questions asked no need to go and verify because he believes that the prophet is a messenger of allah and therefore he does not require any further investigation for us muslims we don't use our logic why is gold haram for men and not haram for women why do men get to marry four women while a muslim woman marries only one man why is fajr two raka's maghrib three and the rest of the prayers four why when there is no water to perform mudu or one is unable to use it he is instructed to dust his hands face and that would be considered as tayammum so many things the answer we may succeed in giving justifications to some maybe all but there will always be something that is an issue of total obedience and this is part of the tests of allah azzawajal the muslims in the early times of islam used to pray to the direction of jerusalem even when they were in mecca when they migrated to medina jerusalem was to their north mecca was to their south so they kept on praying to the north until allah ordered them to shift 180 degrees to makkah the disobedient the hypocrites the disbelievers said why was there a change of direction the muslims don't know where to pray not knowing that that was a test from allah azzawajal so that it would be revealed who believes and who doesn't likewise when we come to abrogation of rules in the beginning of islam it is allah's wisdom and divine will that he may order us at that particular period of time to do something and then abrogate it either because it is easier or because the people are accepting it and are ready to take this ruling as in the case of intoxicants in the beginning allah azzawajal told them that it is permissible to drink it but it's not a good thing to do then it was abrogated by you can drink but must not pray while in the state of intoxication and finally they were told avoid it nowadays we do not use this step by step in abrogation because the deen has been completed at the time of the prophet this was possible because the prophet was there and the revelation was possible so for laymen when they ask why we tell them because this is how allah wanted it and we don't know the reason why does allah azzawajal command us if we want to slaughter sacrifice on the day of udhi that we should refrain from cutting our nails and clipping our nails and cutting our hair why we have not been told the reason and the justification but we believe and this is the best approach allah knows best you"
