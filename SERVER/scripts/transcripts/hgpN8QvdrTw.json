  "title": "Must women undo small braids for Ghusl, this is difficult especially for African women",
  "transcript": "Jia from France I have a question regarding a human gel in general after her mantion so it was written in a book that some Scholars have said it's obligatory for a human to untie her hair if it is braided for the G after the menstration but it's not obligatory to do it um for a good to remove the state of Chaba the evidence is the Hadith of aari whatam said take water Lotus leaves and undo and comb your hair so they say that it's clear that you cannot Comb hair unless it's undone so is the AO understanding correct because African women have very curly hair and often keep it inat in breads sometimes very small ones so it will be very difficult to un tie it um before each go and we pray them afterwards the most authentic opinion of Scholars backed by Hadith of mother AA may Allah be pleased with her when he she heard that it's an issue of dispute of course when she heard that Abdullah Omar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father used to order women to unraid their hair whenever they're doing rul uh uh for um men menstruation she said she said as an objection why wouldn't he ask them to shave their head as well so the most authentic opinion and to my recollection this is the opinion of and is that it is not mandatory to unraid the braids of a woman when she's doing Gul whether the rul is for her mensis or to uplift a major ritual imp Purity due to janaba she doesn't have to do this it's not mandatory she must soak her braids and ensure that the water reaches every single hair and in her scalp as well and that's all and Allah Knows Best"
