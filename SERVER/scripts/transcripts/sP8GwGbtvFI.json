  "title": "Who is Imam Al-Bukhari and what is his significance? | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Serious topic. Why choose Al-Adab Al-Mufrad? First of all, because of the compiler. Who's the compiler? Al-Imam Al-Bukhari. And whenever you hear Al-Imam Al-Bukhari, you think of an authentic hadith. Even if you don't know Arabic, if someone says Bukhari, you know. The leader and the president of Nigeria is Bukhari. At the moment, he's a general. So when he says something, everybody says, next week I'll be in Nigeria, so pray for me that I don't go into trouble. They're good people, mashaAllah. Now, Imam Al-Bukhari is Muhammad Ibn Ismail Ibn Rahim Al-Bukhari. One of the great scholars of Ahlul Sunnah wal Jamaah. The real Ahlul Sunnah wal Jamaah. Those who follow the footsteps of the Prophet ﷺ. Those who have sound aqeedah. Who believe in the Qur'an as it is. Who believe in the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and follow it extensively. Not choose and pick. These are the Ahlul Sunnah wal Jamaah. He is the compiler of Al-Jami' al-Sahih. Known to us as Sahih al-Bukhari. His way of acquiring knowledge was phenomenal. And he started acquiring knowledge. He started to be a student of knowledge when he was how old? Ten years of age. When he was eleven, he used to debate with his scholars and shuyukh. Correcting them. Them being angry because he is correcting them. And when they check, they come back to him and say, we're sorry, you're right. And they correct the mistakes from this eleven year old child. When he was sixteen, he started to spread his wings. And people from all over the world used to meet him and tell him in the thousand to sit and teach them the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ. And he travelled all over the Muslim countries to again. He had a thousand and eighty teacher shuyukh. From each shaykh, he learnt more than ten thousand hadiths. Authentic and weak. And he filtered them all to become a shuyukh."
