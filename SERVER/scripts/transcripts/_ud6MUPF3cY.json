  "title": "Al-Sunnah: We will Never go Astray with These 2 Things (Basics Part 10) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] and welcome to this new episode of your program the basics coming to you in ramadan one of the main basics of islam is the quran and we talked about this in the previous two episodes i highly recommend that you watch them again the prophet said i am leaving among you two things you will never go astray you will never go astray as long as you adhere to them the book of allah and the sunnah of his messenger isn't this part of the basics of islam without any doubt the prophet allah islam is telling us you as an ummah and as an individual will never go astray you'll always remain on the straight path providing you adhere you abide you hold on to the quran and to the sunnah and what is the definition of sunnah because we hear this a lot there is a linguistic definition and there is a legislative definition so the linguistic definition the sunnah means in language the way the way is the sunnah that is followed whether good or bad the prophet said alaihis salatu in an authentic hadith whoever sets a good precedent in islam will have the reward of that and the reward of those who do it after him without that detracting from their reward in the slightest whoever sets a good precedent in arabic this means that when you set a good precedent you are paving the way for the people to follow you then you will be rewarded and this is referring to reviving the way of the prophet islam which people had forgotten as explained in the hadith so this is the linguistic definition of sunnah now scholars of islam have different definition depending on their science for example the scholars of hadith who are the scholars of hadith they are the scholars who deal in purifying the hadith of the prophet by looking into the chain of narrators and selecting those who are authentic those who are not so that they can ensure that the hadith reaching us is authentic through the chain of the narrations and through studying the narrators themselves biography whether they've heard it from the one before them or not whether they were able to carry it to the one after them or not etc it's a big huge science in islam so these scholars have the definition of sunnah and they say that a sunnah is any statement the prophet had said or whatever the prophet had done why even says the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam used to put his right hand over the left hand on his chest whenever he stood for prayer this is his action so describing his action is part of the sunnah number three anything that the prophet allah saw approved so something happened in front of him and he did not deny that person or prohibited it upon him it means that it is approved and it's part of the sunnah and this is called sunna of approval someone eats a desert lizard in the front of the prophet sam but the prophet does not eat it so he asks is it haram the prophet says no but i don't like it so seeing him eating it and not saying anything this is an approval then there is the sunnah of description the prophet wasn't told and wasn't short al-islam his eyes were white and this his color was whitish with a little bit of redness uh this and that his fingers were a little bit large and when he walked he walked like a descending form in a very quick fashion all of this description is considered to be part of the sunnah and they also include the seerah the biography of the prophet sallam to be part of the sunnah this is a definition of sunnah to the scholars of hadith when it comes to the scholars of the fundamentals of and these scientists and scholars look at the holistic picture of jurisprudence and legislations so they speak about the sources of islam of legislation and they refer to these sources as the quran the sunnah and the consensus of scholars analogy etc etc etc so when they refer to the sunnah they mean to refer to one of the main sources of legislation in islam these are the fundamentals the scholars of the fundamentals of when we talk about the scholars of the hambali hanafi maliki shafiri schools of thought that deal with halal and haram how to do forms of worship with transactions marriages etc they refer to the sunnah as one of the categories of deeds taklifiya so we have mandatory opposing haram prohibited then we have sunnah or mustahab in contrast to makru or disliked or not recommended then we have permissible so sunnah here means something that is recommended if you do it you're rewarded if you don't do it you are not sinful unlike mandatory or wajib if you do it you're rewarded if you don't do it you are sinful and you'll get bad deeds for that now further to that the scholars of theology refer to sunnah as the true authentic akida which was relayed to us through trustworthy companions to the taberine to the tavern and this is rarely used as sunnah but it was used with the scholars of previous times such as imam ahmad may allah have mercy on his soul when he wrote his book and he included in it all what deals with the authentic akida and this is why we are called we are labeled as a sunnah why because we refer to this great source of legislation we abide by it and we consider those who don't to be deviant and not part of the proper way of conviction and belief in islam now without the sunnah you cannot have a correct akida such as knowing allah's beautiful names and attributes such as your belief in the hereafter and whatever minor or major signs that fall under its umbrella the coming of the antichrist the jail the descending of esab miriam jesus peace be upon him the belief in how the soul exits the body when we die and the life of the barzah the stage between dunya and the hereafter the torment and the blessings one gets in his grave resurrection this the the sarat the scale the pool of the prophet and all these things without the sunnah you cannot believe in it and your conviction would be deficient and missing now we know that every door has a key and the key for paradise is the shahada and this is well known to everybody how to accept islam how to embrace islam by saying the shahada what is this so without your belief in the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam to be the servant and the messenger of allah the almighty you can't enter paradise so it's an essential part of your iman to believe in the sunnah because i bear witness that muhammad is allah's messenger and servant what does it mean this statement when you say it does it have any meaning under it of course without this meaning it is without any use what does it mean when i say it it means that i obey him in what he orders and i refrain from whatever he prohibits and i believe in whatever he says from the things that are unseen or that happened in the past and i do not worship allah except by what he had ordained and told us this is what ashadu ana muhammadan abdul varsulu entails this is what it must contain otherwise a person is not a muslim a person is not a follower of the prophet now being part of the basics of islam indeed is a significant target for the enemies of islam the enemies of islam know that they cannot set the muslim to go astray unless they shake their conviction and belief in either the quran or the sunnah and that is why they are relentlessly trying their level best to do so yet allah has pledged to protect the quran and the sunnah allah says and allah has revealed to you o muhammad the book and wisdom the book is the quran the wisdom is the sunna and has taught you that which you did not know many times we hear this from enemies of islam or those affiliated with them that we only abide by the quran that the sunnah may contain wrong information the prophet is a human being he may make errors and mistakes allah says in the quran by the star when it descends your companion that is muhammad ali has not strayed nor has he heard nor does he speak from his own inclination it is not but a revelation revealed some people say no no this is referring only to the quran and this is not entirely true it refers to the quran and to whatever the prophet says asked me i'll be pleased with him and with his father used to be one of the learned companions who used to document and note down everything that the prophet islam islam says so one day he came to the prophet ali his salah he said o prophet of allah the people of quraish blame me this called me and say you write everything that prophet muhammad says though he's a human being he may speak when he's angry and when he's pleased meaning that he may say things when when he's angry that he would not approve of and that would not be a revelation so the prophet said alaihis salatu to abdullah document whatever i say by who my soul is in his hand meaning by allah nothing comes out of it except the truth so the prophet allah speaks only with wahi with a revelation however he may sometimes speak or act upon his own thinking initially had and if he makes a mistake allah would correct him on the spot and that we know for certain that nothing reaches us that is dubious or probable everything that reaches us which allah did not correct is a revelation so when the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam once frowned in the face of a blind man who came to ask for advice allah azzawajal immediately revealed the surah telling the prophet isaiah not to frown in the face of a blind man and this by itself is incredible and astonishing the prophet did not say anything ali islam salam the feelings of the blind man were not harmed because he's blind he could not see the frown of the prophet allah yet allah teaching his prophet not even to frown even when the man is blind because the prophet has the most excellent in levels of moral conduct and behavior and this is why allah wanted him and he was the best of all mankind so this all shows us where the sunnah is that the enemies of islam are trying their best to undermine to cast doubts to make you feel that maybe there's a probability or better mort for them to make you reject parts of it or all of it as we will come and talk in more details inshaallah in tomorrow's episode we have a short break stay tuned and insha allah will be right back"
