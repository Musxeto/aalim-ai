  "title": "Is Tawaf al Wida Mandatory for Umrah",
  "transcript": "I want to ask, is it mandatory for Umrah pilgrims to perform the Tawaful Wada'a? Tawaful Wada'a is an issue of dispute among scholars when it comes to Umrah. The vast majority say that the Hadith of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them, with him and his father, was referring to Hajj. So whoever performs the rituals of Hajj, he should make the last act of Ibadah before leaving Mecca to perform Tawaful Wada'a. And this is the most authentic opinion. As for Umrah, some of the scholars said that also it requires Tawaful Wada'a because that Hadith is general and it fits Umrah as well as Hajj. But the most authentic opinion is that it is not required for Umrah and Allah knows best."
