  "title": "If women cannot see Imam, how would she know when he makes sujood at tilawa or pray witr 2+1?",
  "transcript": "Ramon sent us an email saying if I am the Imam and there are women also praying behind me and cannot see me and if I do the sujood at Chihuahua then they might get confused so what should I do in that case and Ron's question has many issues one the segregation between men and women at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was done in the Masjid so women took the back of the Masjid while men took the front of the Masjid and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said that the best rows of men those are that are first and the worst rows of men those that are last and the best rows of women those that are last and the worst of women's rows those that are first so the Prophet has a salaam promoted segregation between men and women even in the Masjid itself and this shows you among other evidences in Islam that such a segregation is highly recommended in our religion it's basically keeping fuel far away from the fire now in modern days people came up with the new aspect of putting women in an isolated section of the Masjid generally speaking in a room of their own where there are walls separating them from men and this is not from the Sunnah and this by itself has a lot of wrong things that could happen among them is that like emmalin said women cannot see the Imam they cannot see the rose behind the imam which means that they rely only on hearing the voice of the imam from the loudspeakers and if electricity goes off or goes out and they cannot hear then you have a big problem so this is not part of the sunnah and it should not be done though we promote segregation though we promote hijab but you can't do something that the Prophet did not do either he asked Allah to was salam and consider that to be part of the deal some scholars said that this is part of the deen it's recommended but because it was not done at the time of the Prophet s erm we should not listen to such opinions and we can see what resulted from it secondly if you're the amount and you know that women cannot see you yes some messages they put a one-sided mirror or two sided I don't know which one is the correct thing so they can the women can see the section of men but the men cannot see the section of women this is okay maybe there is no problem that at least they can visualize the prayer in front of them so if you are they ma'am and you're leading the prayer and you know that they will be confused you have one of two options one of them is before you start the prayer you make a announcement you make an announcement stating that listen brothers and sisters insha'Allah we will be reciting a ayah which so be careful in the first struck out in the second wrecker that we will be doing this thus this announcement is sufficient inshallah the second alternative is that you skip reading an ayah that has two Jude in it so that you would be safe"
