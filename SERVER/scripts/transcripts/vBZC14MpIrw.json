  "transcript": "Maham from Pakistan Alum I want to ask that like as Muslims we know that we should think positively of Allah like like he will accept our duas but um what if we fear for our sins like we fear that what if Allah punishes us and everyone sins but like what if we fear that he would punish us for that and maybe our doas won't get accepted and the best won't happen to us so how can we like it there is no middle way because you have no option if you're afraid of your sins and of Allah's punishment coming to you whether in this life or in the grave or in the Hereafter whether it is physically or by rejecting your Dua you have no other option yeah show me your options either you make Dua while being afraid that Allah would reject it for your sins but at the same time being hopeful and thinking positively of Allah and this is the balance between hope and fear of Allah and this is what every mmin should be but there is no second alternative by saying hm I think I'm not going to make Dua because Allah is not going to respond and this is called being despair of Allah's mercy and this is a major sin that can lead to someone leaving the fault of Islam so your only option is to continue to make Dua to continue to be positive in thinking of Allah Asel and optimistic and at the same time being afraid that Allah May reject your Dua because of your previous sins so you repent and ask Allah for forg for forgiveness continuously introducing this a privacy focused Islamic matchmaking app that follows the soona no photos no chatting and a Wall-E involved matchmaking process find a Pious spouse the Sunway download NIS now"
