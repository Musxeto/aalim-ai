  "transcript": "from the Philippines question is how do we know if a thing acts as a barrier and how do we remove this from the Philippines how do we know that a barrier prevents water from reaching the skin this is a little bit difficult to explain because the nature of a barrier that it makes a layer so so if there's a layer on my skin if there's a paint layer which if I use acetone or thinner or uh peel it off it peels out this is a layer but if it's just a color so when I put this on my hand it's a color it's not a layer it's just simply a color doesn't have a barrier that prevents water there is no problem in that so how can we recognize a barrier if it makes a layer then it is a barrier"
