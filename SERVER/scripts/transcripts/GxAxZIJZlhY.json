  "transcript": "Islam this question is crystal clear a friend of his and a lot of the people nowadays among the Muslims who do not have strong Islamic knowledge they have even not the sufficient amount of knowledge of allah azza wajal they don't know their Lord so nowadays they look at life as numbers so Mike income is so and so my expenditure is so-and-so which means that I have left so-and-so savings or I have to borrow at the end of the month what do I do I get married I have to stop pre-production so my wife has to take conceptive x' we must not have children at all or maybe have one every 20 years why is that the resources of the universe are far less than 10 20 years ago the resources on earth we don't have enough food we don't have clean air we don't have so and so on so subhanAllah these people don't know Allah as the result to begin with and it is Allah Azza WA JAL who created us and who gave us this universe and he told us that I have made everything in it for you yet we doubt his provisions without his ability to provide for us and we depend and we choose instead to depend on our own selves and our own powers and intellect and resources and this is where we fail miserably the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam reproduce have a lot of children because on the day of judgment I will boast about my nation among the other nations so now is instructing us to reproduce didn't Allah tell em that the resources will be short as they claim and the air would be polluted and the rivers there will be droughts the Prophet told us Al salatu was-salam that you should marry a woman who is known to be kind and nice and from a producing family her sisters her cousin's etc they all have a lot of children and likewise there are so many hadith that encourage this so at the end of the day I'm a Muslim maybe if you're an atheist maybe you for a non-muslim you find it easy to challenge but for Muslims they could have no room for discussion over this topic Allah is a provider so you think that you use contraceptives and you have one child and you think you can provide for a child we've seen people in poor areas having five ten fifteen children and they're all mashallah go to bed with a full stomach they're happy I know a lot of families that have ten children and above who the majority of them are high quality children they there are medical doctors engineers pilots businessmen so where did this idea come from this idea came from the enemies of Islam so the less Muslims there are the greater and the easier it is for them to control us and this is not according to Islam so brother Islam as agreed before you win my friend he definitely Allah is a provider you do what Allah tells you to do and Allah takes care of everything else and do not listen to those who say or doubt that Allah can provide for you because they have issues may Allah sir shall guide them all"
