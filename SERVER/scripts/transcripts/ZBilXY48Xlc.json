  "title": "Limbs dry up while lifting pants when making wudu, does this invalidate it? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I says while doing Woodill if we touch our pants to lift up the legs to wash in the wash basin our hands get dried out due to touching the pants does this drying up of hands invalidate our rule we have six pillars of woudl there are six pillars of woudl one is washing the face two washing the arms to the elbows three wiping over the head for washing the feet five the sequence as mentioned six what is known as el mu a lat the more lat is being simultaneous in what you do so if I wash my face I wouldn't go and answer a call open the door check the food on the stove and then come and wash my arms to the elbows this is not permissible so scholars in order to explain it to people the incident of being simultaneous they said that the definition of simultaneous is that your organ would not dry out in normal conditions what does that mean in the heat of the Sun in the summer inside Arabia for example if you wash your face by the time you wash your left arm your face is right should I wash it again they said no because this is due to the heat this is due to the wind this is due to a number of factors this is not what brakes simultaneously being simultaneous unfortunately people who read this thought that okay so if I washed my forearm right forearm then my sleeves went down it must have dried a little bit so I have to wash it again no this is not true because I'm still doing it simultaneously then what is meant by drying your limbs it means that it is the time that would take my limp to dry in normal condition without any legitimate reason so for example if I were to uplift my trousers so that I can raise my feet my dog would dry do I have to wash it again no there's nothing wrong in that even that some scholars say if you dry your right foot before putting it in the shoe and then wash your left foot this is okay because it is still continuous the wool is still continuous and drying the limb intentionally has nothing to do with breaking the simultaneous actions of Woodill in hence there is no problem at all in drying your hand when lifting your trousers or touching your thumbs or whatever when doing voodoo and a large ell knows best"
