  "transcript": "Alright, the question please. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, I just want to ask about nowadays parenting is very hard because everything is not according, surrounding us is not following our Quran and Sunnah and how are we going to do because I feel when we are at home it is easy to manage our kids but when they are outside being with friends and starting to follow the trend bringing back at home and I'm feeling a bit fear most of the time that I'm not doing good enough to guide my kids and Allah will punish me for that and my kids also will not benefit anything from all the influence outside. How are we going to use that Quran and Sunnah to guide our kids in nowadays? Question, question, answer with yes or no. How are we going to? No, no, no, I understood your question. I'm not that old. Sorry. No, no, I understood your question. I'm asking you a question answer with yes or no. Are you doing your best? I got the answer or you don't have a microphone. Oh, okay. I thought I'm feeling that I'm not going doing good enough. Question is very simple. Are you doing your best? No. No. Okay. Now I got the answer. The issue of Tarbiyah of the children is a very huge topic and it requires a dedicated session from experts, from people who studied Tarbiyah. I don't have this experience. I have only 13 children so I'm not that qualified. This was a nightmare to my wife and myself when we try to bring our children according to Quran and Sunnah, but we have parents. My wife has parents. They have television. I don't have a television in my house because it's distraction, lots of music, lots of haram things. So take it out. And my children were the first, Mashallah, the highest in their schools. I've never opened a page for a child of mine. She comes, Daddy, you're a linguist in English. I have this question and tomorrow we have exam in English, tough luck. Are you going to be a professor, a doctor? You want to become a doctor, you become a doctor or you don't. I don't have time. I have 13 of you. Imagine if I have to spend half an hour here, even if you pay me money, I will not be able to afford this. It's too much. Alhamdulillah, they depended on themselves, no outside teachers, and they, Mashallah, some of them are teaching in universities of my children, Alhamdulillah, with the grace of Allah. So this was a nightmare. How did we solve it? We can't guide and the guidance in Allah's hands. The Prophet as lived with his uncle, his beloved uncle, Abu Talib, for almost 50 years. And he protected him. He loved him like his own child. And he believed in him and he said poetry in him. On his deathbed, he said, Ya Amma, my uncle, say one word, La ilaha illallah, I will intercede with Allah to save you from hellfire. And he could not persuade him to say it. This is the Prophet of Allah. And this is his beloved uncle. And Allah says, It's not for you to guide them. It's for Allah. So when we came to the conclusion of do what you have to do in your house, haram is haram, halal is halal. Whoever is pleased, Alhamdulillah, whoever is not pleased, he's forced to be pleased. It's my house. When they grow up and they get married, we did our due diligence through convincing them through evidence, through raising them on the Quran, on the Sunnah in their spare time in summer. Each one is supposed to revise five to 10 pages of the Quran every day. 12 of my daughters memorize the Quran at school, Alhamdulillah, by heart. But they forget. This is Quran if you don't revise it. So every summer, it's holidays, we don't have anything, no. There is no social media, there is no mobiles, there is nothing until you revise, depending on their capacity, between five pages and 10 pages. Every day. Hard. Takes them two, three hours. But tough luck, tough bananas, what are you going to do? You have to live with it. And they do it. So we do our level best. If you, every time the pacifier of your child falls on the ground, you go and wash it, your child will be prone to many diseases. Why? His immune system is weak. Everything is clean, everything is hygienic, everything is this, no, no, no. You have to understand that your child cannot live in a bubble in your house. He has to go out to school. And in school, wallahi, your face will turn red by the things that you see or hear. They learn in school things that we are ashamed of. But this is life. So how can you protect? By making them grow up on knowing Allah. On the basics of Islam. On Iman. And you make dua every single Salat. Every night prayer. You make dua, dua, dua, dua and khalas. You leave them to Allah Azza wa Jal. But you can't live in constant fear and depression and thinking that this will happen or this won't happen. You do your best and Allah Azza wa Jal will take care of the rest inshallah and Allah knows best."
