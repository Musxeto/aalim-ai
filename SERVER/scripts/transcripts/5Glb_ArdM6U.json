  "title": "Does a long pause require Sujood as Sahu ? prostration of forgetfulness",
  "transcript": "Fidan from turkey says is a long pause a reason \nto offer prostration of sahu the prostration of   sahu as scholars say is either for skipping \nsomething that is mandatory or a pillar,   or adding something that is mandatory or a pillar; \nanything that is voluntary it is not considered   to be a cause of concern. So for example \nI know that raising the hands is a sunnah   if I omit it, my prayer is valid because \nit's neither pillar nor mandatory if I add   when I go to sujud I raise my hands which is \nnot from the sunnah again this does not require   sujud as sahu now the issue is while praying, I \nrecited the fatiha and i paused for 10-15 seconds   trying to remember the ayah which I concluded \nmy previous rakah with so that I can continue   and I'm blacking out I don't know so 15 seconds \n20 seconds I'm just sitting trying to remember,   does this require sujood \nas sahu? The answer is: No"
