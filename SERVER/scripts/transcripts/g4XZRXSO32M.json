  "transcript": "consider subscribing cd from germany um should all atheists also to consider to be in mushrikeen okay atheists are those who do not believe in religion do not believe in the existence of allah azzawajal the almighty so are they considered to be mushrikun worshipping other than allah azzawajal some would argue and say they don't believe in the existence of allah so how could be how could they be mushrik others say no they are mushrik because no matter what they say deep down they believe that allah exists but they are in defiance and they pretend not to was says they deny it they reject it though inside they believe in it but they reject it out of arrogance and pride so i believe that all atheists who are so in defiance to the fact that allah exists they are blinded by the light it is so obvious that everyone can recognize that this universe was created by allah and that allah is running everything and without him we are in great loss they deny it they claim and they swear i don't know but with what but they swear and they would go to distances to prove that they don't believe but they do believe so they are actually mushrik they're associating others with allah because they're worshiping their whims and desires and they're taking their whims and desires as a god other than allah whom they worship and allah azza knows best you"
