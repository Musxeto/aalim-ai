  "transcript": "Azhar from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I had a doubt regarding paying or giving Sadaqah to a Masjid for the renovation The Masjid is just next to my door where we usually go and pray, all our first prayers But the doubt I have is because it does the renovations like the Mawlid like the entire Rabiul Awal, they decorate the entire Masjid with lights and the entire month after every Isha prayer they have Mawlid and they have a congregational Dua after every first prayer. So since they do all this bid'ah, is it okay for me to I mean give some charity for its renovation? Since the renovation is now going on they are asking me for money so I just want to make sure about this and then pay them As long as this Masjid does not stand on endorsing Shirk, then it is Alhamdulillah a Masjid for the Muslims. Despite the fact that they are doing renovations, these renovations are prohibited and a major sin, but these are not Shirk or Kufr. If they need help to renovate or to fix the lights, you may help them because Muslims still pray there and their prayer is accepted for the sake of Allah. But if there is another Masjid that is a Masjid that follows the Sunnah, no. It is best to give your money to that Masjid and help them rather than help this Masjid of innovation. But if you give the money to them while they're not doing Kufr or Shirk, this is permissible, Inshallah."
