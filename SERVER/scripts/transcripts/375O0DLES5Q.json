  "title": "Time of Necessity VS Time of Obligation for prayer (delaying prayer & makrooh times) Assim AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "maryam's first question was that she heard that isha has a time of necessity what is meant by time of necessity see us or time is divided into a time of obligation and a time of necessity so the beginning of the time of asar is when the shade is equal to the height of an erect object once the shade becomes the same length this is ascertain and this beginning of the time is extended some say until it is twice the length and the most authentic opinion is until the brightness of the sun becomes yellow and it's possible to look close to it which is approximately an hour and a half maybe a little bit more after the time of asar so this time when the length of the shade is the same as the erect object till the time where the sun's brightness is gone and the sun becomes yellow instead of white this is called the time of obligation this is the best time to pray you're allowed to pray from the beginning to the end but once the the sun becomes yellow till the time it sets this is called time of necessity so scholars say that yeah you can pray but it is makru because you've delayed it for too long so the prayer is valid you have no problem but it is a time of necessity this is what some scholars say about it now in isha we know that the beginning of time of isha prayer is when you look at the west where the sun has set and the redness in the twilight disappears this means that the time of maghrib is over now it's time for isha till when well the scholars say that it extends till midnight and what it's what is midnight our midnight in islam is different than the midnight of the westerners where cinderella's cottage becomes a pumpkin it's not 12 o'clock our midnight is calculated by measuring the time from the sunset till the break of dawn so if it's 10 hours divide them into two it's five hours add the five hours to the time of sunset so if the sun sets at seven o'clock then it becomes twelve if the sun sets at six o'clock it becomes eleven it depends on these two variables sunset and the brick of dawn divide them into two and this is the time of midnight so she says some schools of thought and this is true say that there is a time of necessity which is after the midnight till the break of dawn this is time for necessity if a woman for example sees her purity from menses at 2 am we say that she doesn't have to pray risha because the time is over with midnight other schools say no it is extended till fajr so it's an issue of dispute i'm inclined to follow what uh the majority say that this ends at midnight and allah azza"
