  "transcript": "Julia Hoffman over him alhamdulillah help inaudible Oh sallallahu wasallam over a car and mafia matin el alamein sayyidina muhammad in water early he was happy humane and Medad assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh this is our first session insha allah azzawajal and hope it's not the last that we began to study one of the book which was published by the Fick Academy let me get the proper Islamic fit Academy and it is a concise yet hopefully beneficial summary of the Islamic faith now this Islamic sir is a very useful platform for a student of knowledge to enroll in one of the biggest advantages is that it's free so when it is free it means that you don't have to worry about paying in order to gain rather is not only free it is also interactive they have like sixteen levels for students and each level has a number of tests that you can enroll in and test your knowledge and how much you have gained and rectify the misconceptions or the mistakes that you have and they have also badges they have prizes they have so many things that is sha Allah people would benefit of with the grace of allah as Woodyard this hopefully platform would be shared also by our Q&A page which is she has Emile Hakim community the the page that has all these questions and answers and Sharla it should be also increasing the outreach for the people I'm hoping that this would be posted any minute now on it be in the last version the book I hope that the administrators would be providing you with a copy of it online soft copy and at the same time each session you will be given the portion that we are supposed to study today's portion is about the pillars of Islam now one would say ok what does studying the pillar of Islam has to do with studying fit well first of all issues related to our Qaeda are considered to be the major and utmost important part of because what good folk is without a peda and not only that it is the definition of his lamb when the prophet alayhi salaatu am in the hadith of Umar may Allah be pleased with him when gibreel peace be upon him asked him what is Islam the Prophet gave the five pillars of Islam so in order to study fit scholars divided FIP into chapters so sections related to forms of worship such as salat zakat fasting hedge and everything related to it so for example salat in order to pray you have to before moodle before performing will do you have to purify yourself if there are any impurities due to answering the call of nature or due to ritual impurity resulting from jahnava or from menses so all of these things are mentioned before salat after salat after say mmm after the cat after Hajj there are the chapters or the sections related to transactions and with transactions we have things that deal with selling and buying because if you want to live you have to eat you have to drink so you need to know what to buy and what not to buy you need to know how to form how to rent how to mortgage how all of these things are included in the section of transactions usually after your stomach is filled and your needs are fulfilled you look for what is more essential with part of which is essential after eating and drinking which is marriage so they talk about marriage divorce they talk about holder they talk about maintenance before divorce and after divorce they talk about custody of the children they talk about Guardians they talk about so many many things now after all of that usually when your stomach is filled and you have gotten married usually dispute takes place and this is when fights may be murder may be stealing because you want things that others possess so they made the section about prescribed punishments in Islam then it moves on to talk about jihad and spreading the religion and the things related to it they also speak about the section specifically about apostasy and leaving Islam etc so all of this is mentioned and classified in the books of fit that a student of knowledge usually is keen to learn about now having said that we move on to the first chapter of the book which says that there are in the beginning the five pillars of Islam the five pillars of Islam are very well known to us all yet I think that we will just try and briefly go through it because there's no point in detailing it because one of the pillars to talk in detail about would take us a couple of hours at least so we'll just skim over it quickly so that next time we meet we speak insha'Allah in more detail about these pillars of forms of worship the most important pillar of all is the declaration the Shahada is to testify and believe that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah Azza WA JAL and that Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wasallam EDA is his servant and messenger so you are not considered a Muslim until you testify and this is something that a lot of the reverts fail to pay attention to a lot of the reverts are under pressure living in with their kafir family and they're afraid of what measures they might take to reprimand them for such an act so they don't declare Islam now between you and Allah you can't be a Muslim but between you and the other Muslim communities you're still a kafir if we fail to hear you declare la ilaha illaallah muhammaden-rasul allah then we cannot accept you as a muslim which means that in this dunya if you were to die you are not to be treated as a Muslim you will not be washed shrouded preyed upon and buried among the Muslims in Muslim cemeteries so it is important if someone comes to say chef I'm a Muslim I believe but I don't want to say the Shahada this is a blatant kafir and it is not accepted of him so what is the Shahada the first part of it is a negation and a confirmation when I say la Allah this is what the atheists say there's no God yeah but we don't stop here we say la ilaha illallah and this beautiful statement if you notice does not require the movement of your mouth in a sense that you can say it without moving your lips la ilaha illallah la ilaha ill allah and it comes so easy it is half negation half confirmation there is no God and we add from our own interpretation worthy of being worshipped because if we say that there is no God except Allah Buddhists would come and say we have Buddha Hindus would come and say we have gods we have hairy cognition and RAM I don't know Krishna media I don't know what who their gods are and everybody would present their gods and say your statement is wrong there is no god yes there are so many gods yet we say that there are false gods and this is why we always say there is no God worthy of being worshipped so this is the negation except Allah this is a confirmation so we limit worshiping only to allah azza wajal it's like when we say in the fatiha yak and a boot what we are constrained only you we worship and only you or Allah we seek guidance and we seek help and if you look at the different humorous verses of the Quran you find it all revolving on the oneness of allah azza wajal and when we talk about the oneness of allah we mean no heat and so he is a big big topic it's not something that you just say ok I shall do a la la la la jeune homme de la sala boom you become a righteous person no you have to believe you have to have the conviction as there are three types of toe heat the first type is towheaded rububiyyah that the heat of lord shift to believe that allah is the provider the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything that is in them that he is the giver of life and the taker of it so he's thought who gives life and death to believe that allah azza wajal is the one who makes rainfall and gives life to everything that is living and facilitates things for all beings now this part of the heed the feed of lordship was shared by all people even the idol worshipers if you ask them who created the heavens and earth may Allah who brings the rain down is Allah who answers when you call they will say Allah everything you ask them they would say I'm not so there is no dispute only a main mute portion of the disbelievers reject the concept of Allah and they are not even point zero zero zero zero one percent the vast majority of people even at those who said that we're not religious we're not practicing they believed in the existence of Allah and in the powers of Allah the Almighty now this is in the towhead of lordship the second part of the heat is the most important part which is the toe heat of worship this is what all the messengers were sent to do and to declare and this is where the dispute between the messengers and their people this is what the dispute arise from that there is no deity other than Allah it means that you you have to devote all forms of worship to allah azzawajal because if you acknowledge that eliza provider Allah is the creator Allah is Allah is that Japan as thou shalt masha'Allah you believe in the lordship of Allah that he's the rub he's the HUD the Creator Allah he will you meet he is the Moodle the facilitator all of this is great but if you worship other than Allah through prayer through sacrifice to other than Allah through seeking refuge through supplicating all of these are forms of worship in this case you become a mushrik because your toe heat was not pure was not evil the third type of toe heat is the towhead of l asthma was the fact the beautiful names and attributes of allah azzawajal and this is also a big way and to talk about it is to believe in allah suitable names without misunderstanding without diverting the meaning without simulating so you have to believe that allah is unlike anything else and that he is all-hearing all-seeing as allah mentioned about himself in the quran when we move to the second part of the Declaration of the Shahada which is why ashhadu anna muhammadan either do who are so low that I bear witness that Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu Selim is Allah servant and messenger what does this entail this means that you acknowledge that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is to be obeyed in all what he commands and that he is to be believed in whatever he states and that you should refrain from whatever he prohibits and you do not worship Allah except by what he has shown us in Arabic it rhymes beautifully thus do fema a Baath Party who FEMA Amma is Tina boomer and Hyuna hwacha were a liar but Allah Allah be mushara this is an essential part of how sincere and true you are in your declaration when the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam says something if you say I believe it but I would not obey it then you're not a true believer if you say I will do what the Prophet says but I will not believe in it but I will do it because I'm afraid of punishment again this is hypocrisy if you obey Him and you refrain from what he has prohibited and you believe what he says but you worship Allah in different ways than what he had taught us meaning you innovate in this case your declaration is not authentic so the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam part of believing that is the servant and messenger of allah you must believe that he was sent to all mankind to all humans and that he was also sent to the jinn and not only that you have to believe that he is the seal of the prophet hood which means that there is no profit non messenger after him so our D on ease remedies those Baha'is those who believe that there is a messenger or a prophet after him they are not considered to be among the Muslims and also you have to part of believing in the prophet alayhi salatu salam you have to honor his sunnah you have to embrace it you have to implement it in your life in terms of belief action and implementation so part of believing in the Prophet Alyce awesome is to declare this belief very verbally so you have to say yes I believe that the Prophet is the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam you have to implement this truth in your life you have to believe in whatever he stated so if he stated to you that there is great tribes of your jujin ma'juj and they will come at the end of the time as mentioned in surat al-kahf and there they that there is a barrier between us and them this is something that you cannot just come and shrug your shoulders and say this is not logical this is part of your belief to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam to humiliate yourself in front of his sunnah and to humble yourself in front of his teachings you must love him at a his salat WA Salam more than you love yourself your wife your spouse your children your parents and all mankind in all your wealth and this love is not a natural love rather it is an Islamic love so the natural love is that you love your children the Islamic love is when you are giving the choice between your children or the Prophet a little salaam who would you sacrifice the Islamic love tells you to sacrifice your children and this is an indication that you are a true believer so following the Sunnah giving priority to whatever he says and accepting it all of this is part of your belief in the declaration now you will find a lot of evidences from the Quran from the Sunna in this first chapter you can go through it I don't think that we need to read it because you will get the time sure a lot to read it and maybe answer some questions on that how important is this declaration of the heat it is extremely important because this is your gate pass to paradise without it you cannot enter paradise the Prophet said are they solid slam in the hula-hula leonetta inland fo and Matt Mira that no one no soul shall enter paradise except a believing soul so you have to be a Muslim and this is why whoever concludes life on earth with saying the statement he will be admitted to gender whoever bears witness that there is no deity other than Allah worthy or be worthy of being worshipped and that Muhammad is a servant and Messenger of Allah this will prevent fire of hell from touching him as in the authentic hadith of course this is just a summary a glimpse but the Shahada we can spend lectures after lecture and there are so many publications and books just highlighting this beautiful Shahada which we were told if it were to put to be put in a scale and in the other scale you have the heavens and the earth the scale of the Shahada of the declaration would over weigh it because of how powerful it is the second pillar of Islam is a salat prayer and we know that prayer is the most important pillar after the declaration of Islam why it is so important that it was the only thing that it was revealed in the seventh heaven while all other teachings of Islam were revealed on earth not only that everything was given to our prophet erase salat wa salam through the arc angel jibreel peace be upon him except the prayer it was given directly by allah subhanaw taala to our Prophet Muhammad Ali salat WA Salam in the seventh heaven scholars agree that whoever prays it is a believer who whoever is lazy to perform it is a hypocrite and whoever abandons it totally is a kafir apostate and a disbeliever now there are five daily prayers composed of seventeen raka these are the pillars or these are the pillar of Islam which is the prayer when we say is traveling prayer we talk about these 17 records the emphatic soon before or after these are voluntary Witter voluntary whatever you go ha it's voluntary if you don't pray anything except these 17 records you are a Muslim the more you do the better you are but this is what Allah ordered you to do now what is the ruling on those who do not pray I don't know if you're going to talk to this to talk about this later on but if you look at the verses of the Quran such as that ensure that Toba or in certain wood death there or elsewhere and combine to it the different narrations of the Prophet a prophetic Sunnah of the Prophet Allah so to Sarah you will find that we have a theoretical and a practical ruling so the theoretical ruling is anyone who does not pray is a kafir and this is established through the Quran as well as the Sunnah the theoretical ruling means that I do not implement it on an individual what does that mean I do not come to a person and I say do you pray he says no I don't pray so I say ok 1 plus 1 equals to a person who doesn't pray is a kafir and this individual does not pray is but this individual does not pray then this equals he is a kafir this is totally wrong because in order to implement this practically there are conditions to be fulfilled and there are obstacles to be eliminated without implementing this we cannot say that an individual is a kafir and this is why a lot of the sisters come to me and say share my husband abuses me he batters me he insults me he doesn't provide for me and I say Annie you have to weigh the consequences weigh the pros and cons because I don't want you to become angry or regretful after asking divorce you have to be patient give him the edge so she because she wants out of the marriage she says and he doesn't freak so when I hear this and say what do you mean by d-doesn't prick he doesn't pray at all she wants me to conclude that oh if he doesn't pray then he's a kafir then your marriage is void by default people come to me and say my father he doesn't trade not a single prayer and I follow the opinion that whoever does not raise a kafir so he died what should I do with the wealth he left because I will not inherit him all of this is strong the default that that individual is a Muslim he claims to be a Muslim he says he's a Muslim all those around him acknowledge that he's a Muslim the problem is if you want to get him out of the fold of Islam this is not for you and you you have to fulfill the conditions that he is willing that is knowledgeable that he's not misinterpreting that is not confused of the ruling because that is not forced for example all of these conditions and obstacles must be eliminated and fulfilled at the same time for the conditions are eliminated for the obstacles and this is usually done by a panel of judges who would sit with the individual si ahi you don't pray say yeah I don't pray I believe its melted by the don't pray no you have to because this is mandatory Allah obliged you to pray bla bla bla he says I understand but I'm not gonna pray now you're talking to a panel of judges they say put him in jail for three days so every day come and pray said no I believe in the obligation of prayer but I don't want to pray for three days he's given a chance to show remorse and pray yet he's arrogant and he is insisting not to pray scholars say such an individual is not a Muslim anymore and he is to be executed and his execution is not a prescribed punishment rather it is for his apostasy and his treatise as an opposed an apostate and he does not receive the funeral rites of a Muslim is not washed shrouded buried in a Muslim Cemetery at all so this is something that we have to acknowledge and understand before going into what as they say shooting from the hip anyone that doesn't pray we just simply say Allah sees a kafir and we take him out of the millah of Islam we will go into details of course about salat etc but any insha'Allah this is just a preview the third pillar of Islam is as the cat as the cat is mostly associated with prayer in the verses of the Quran a farm of salata were artists the cat always you will find them combined or joined usually and the cat is defined linguistically and technically like most of the forms of worship and salat for example linguistically it is duaa and technically it is specific movements and rhetorics at specific times inaugurated by the Kobe rattle Iran and concluded by a Salaam so when we come to the catch it's the same thing the cat linguistically is growth and increase and it also relates to purity and cleansing and good behavior now paying the cat without a doubt cleanses your rook record book from since it erases it not only that it cleanses your soul and this is why Allah ordered muhammad alayhi salat saw our prophet to take the cat from them to take charity to purify them with it so when you give it purifies is your soul when you give the poor and the needy it purifies is your soul and it also prioritizes you from different types of sins and zakat is defined technically as a duty paid by certain individuals over a specific amount which is the threshold on specific categories such as gold silver cash things that grow up from the earth crops that is cattle livestock and merchandise that is for sale providing that the time circulation has taken place which is known as a house and we will come to talked about this insha'Allah in the future if Allah is willing now this is a cat is not given randomly it must be given to a specific category one out of eight mentioned in ayah number 60 in Chapter number nine surah at-taubah these eight categories are the only recipients of zakat money the cat is a laws right in our wealth so when salat is required to be performed by an individual who is sane who's reached the age of puberty who's accountable zakat is unlike that even if an individual is insane or we have an orphan six years old five years old who has an edited a million we must take the cat from this wealth though the owner is not accountable and this is the most authentic opinion because it is ullas right in that wealth and there are so many any other rulings on that the fourth pillar of Islam is fasting in Arabic fasting is to refrain so you can refrain from speaking you can refrain from major sins you can refrain from eating and drinking this is all linguistically called fasting in the technical term fasting is to abstain to the frame from anything that nullifies your fasting of the things that we will come to listen in sha allah from dawn till sunset with the intention of worshipping allah and this is a very important addition because you can refrain from eating and drinking from the break of dawn till sunset because you're a dieting because you are testing yourself because you don't feel like eating but this is not considered to be islamic fasting islamic fasting has to be accompanied by the intention which is to worship from law the all-mighty now fasting the days of the month of ramadan is the pillar we're talking about so when we say about the fourth pillar of islam is fasting we don't mean fasting mondays and thursdays this is emphatic sunnah we don't refer to fasting the three white days or Rapha or Muzdalifah these are all voluntary fasting we only mean about fasting the month of Ramadan this is what the Prophet said that is salat wa salam to one of his companions who came and asked him about it he said too fast the month of Ramadan and the Companions wanted emphasis and to be sure and he said nothing else and the Prophet said Oh sir nothing else except if you want to volunteer so this is what is a pillar of Islam the cat which was previously mentioned is different than charity you are obliged to give 2.5 percent of your savings of cash gold or silver if they reach the threshold and a holy lunar year passes but you can give more as charity not as the cat and the sky is the limit so no one talks about charity and says that this is mandatory no what is mandatory what is a pillar is a cat the percentage 2.5 percent can be 5 percent can be 10 percent depending on the thing that we are giving the cat over and we will come to discuss this insha'Allah later on so the fasting of Ramadan is one of the pillars of Islam you miss it because you're sick or because you're traveling or a woman has a monthly period or you are old and unable all of this would be looked into insha'Allah later on the final pillar is hatch which is known as pilgrimage and linguistically pilgrimage is in Arabic al-qasim though which is setting off for a definite destination technically it is traveling to Mecca to perform this ritual according to the particular manner at a specific time and under specific conditions and hatch is mandated once in a lifetime so every Muslim who's capable physically and financially and has no barriers to prevent him from performing Hajj must perform it once in a lifetime and there are conditions and there are ways and there are things that are related to this a woman without a Muharram cannot perform Hajj and it's not mandated upon her until she is able to find a Muharram Allah says pilgrimage to his house is a duty owed to Allah by all people who are able to undertake it so it is a an obligation upon people and also the Prophet said Allah has salat wa salam in the hadith of even Omar may Allah be pleased with the matter of this father Islam has been built on five pillars one testifying that there is no deity worthy of being worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger Al Asad Salam to performing the prayers three praying the zakat for making the pilgrimage to the house of five and fasting in Ramadan and this was narrated by Bihari and reported by Bukhari and Muslim therefore these are the five pillars of Islam which each and every Muslim on earth most likely know them by heart and most likely try their level best to abide by them as they are the basics of Islam then we elevate to the higher level which is Eman and it's six pillars then we elevate to a lesson but the bare minimum that would help us identify an individual as a Muslim is to commit to these five pillars of Islam so this is today's material I have no idea if I can check your questions or not but let me give it a shot insha allah azza wajal as I'm filming this from my iphone and here we go 18 comments maybe I don't know and no this is not it how to see the comments something still have to find so we have Umbreon here the question is on my iPhone if I want to go for Hajj and handle I have money time and health but my Muharram does not fit okay I can't see the rest give me a second llahi I apologize but because I am from the era of dinner dinosaurs I'm unable to find means to see the questions so on my iPad I'm unable to do that nope no can do so I think we will wrap it up here and hopefully the administration would try to explain this to me later on so that we can do that later ah as planned if I am going to continue with this program hopefully Monday and Thursday same time next Monday it will be Q&A which will be picked from the link that the administration should have insha'Allah and they will send it to me Sunday night so Monday same time 4:30 matka time till 5:30 I will be answering your questions and every Thursday with the grace of a large of JAL we will try to do it here insha Allah Azza WA JAL from the book and we will try to go through the rulings of fact from beginning to end so until I meet you next time I leave with you a vanilla assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
