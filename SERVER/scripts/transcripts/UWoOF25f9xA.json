  "transcript": "Sumeyya from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is so if a person is working as a Qur'an teacher and Islamic studies teacher for children and the person, the head teacher that employed this person didn't bother looking at the qualification of this person rather he just trusts them that they know Qur'an and the Islamic studies that this person is supposed to teach is from Hanafi book and sometimes there is things like wiping the neck in wudu, sometimes like bleeding books you will do and some contradictions in that book but parents don't care or they generally believe in this so is this person sinful working like this is his income haram if he teaches these things and there's sometimes stories and serials in there the person doesn't know the details of seerah to know that this is wrong or right he just knows the basic knowledge from seerah so as long as the main points are right can he teach first of all a teacher is obliged to teach a syllabus so he's doing his job he's being paid for it now the problem is when this is related to Islam either the teacher is someone of knowledge a student of knowledge a scholar in this case it is his duty or her to correct whatever mistakes they encounter and to explain it to their students bearing in mind that each and every school of thought whether it is Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i or Hanbali have 85% to 90% authentic information so the Hanafi school of thought is filled with correct information there is a margin of error between 10 to 15 maybe 20% due to the fact that it was not based on Quran or Sunnah rather on ra'i on opinion on Ijtihad and the same goes for Maliki school the Shafi'i school and Hanbali school so if you are a student of knowledge who has the ability to filter such material and pinpoint what is right and what is wrong and give them the alternative that's a win-win but if you're a layman if you're someone who doesn't possess this knowledge then you're not sinful for teaching what is in the Hanafi books or the Hanbali books because this is the best of your ability and knowledge same goes for the seerah if you don't know otherwise and you're teaching what's in the syllabus trusting it there is no sin on you and Allah knows best"
