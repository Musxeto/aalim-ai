  "transcript": "Ibrahim from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I have a question I have my mosque that's like 10-15 minutes walk from me that I sometimes go for the Salat I wanted to ask is it fine to do Ruqya on the way to the mosque to just read it? just to be more frequent in doing it I don't know how to do I know the surahs to read but I don't know how to do it if I can just do it while I'm walking Ruqya is done for the purpose of healing and not for the purpose of protection so if someone is suffering from an illness from pain from evil eye envy jinn possession or black magic he may do Ruqya upon himself this is highly recommended and it is not a requirement for Ruqya to be seated or to be in a particular place you can do Ruqya while walking while working while sleeping while in your home without any problem"
