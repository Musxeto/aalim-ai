  "transcript": "Imad from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I was wondering about the event that took place when Hamas attacked Israel Akhi, this is something that we do not talk about generally in public because any person with intellect and two eyes and ears knows that the Muslims in Palestine have been oppressed, killed, displaced, tortured, imprisoned, their land confiscated, kicked from their own lands that they've been living for thousands of years since 1948. So you do not expect someone who is oppressed to clap and say good job, keep up the good work. Anyone who's being oppressed, even if you oppress an animal, it will fight back. So there is no reason for the occupiers and those transgressors, those villains, those murderers who occupied Muslim lands to come and play the victim, they're not the victim. Therefore, we refer to whatever is happening as a genocide. Whatever is happening to the Muslims in Palestine at the moment is a clear genocide. No one defends it except a criminal of war who is assisting criminals. May Allah protect us all. For more UN videos visit www.un.org"
