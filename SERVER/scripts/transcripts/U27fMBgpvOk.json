  "title": "Can I skip fasting if I'm sick, have a cold or infection? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Omar from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, we know that it is sinful if someone knows that fasting because of an illness such as a cold will do harm you or delay the recovery so you can eat and drink in public due to necessity so my question is when you consider that an infection can last 2, 3, 4 weeks is it enough to wait until you have reached the stage of a mild cold meaning around 80-90% recovery after 2 or 3 days to continue the fasting? Jazak Allah Khairan Jazak, this is something that is relative and it differs from one person to the other and it has to be related to the advice of the physician, of the doctor so if the doctor says to you that yes you have to stop fasting you have to take the medication on time or it would harm you or delay your recovery let us look at the infection, if it's the normal cold that poses no threat to your life and no real hardship and we know that normal cold whether you take medicine or drink orange juice and lemonade or you don't it's going to take its course between 5-7 days regardless whether you do take medicine or not it's going to take its course so if this is the case then no, there is no hardship, there is no threat to your life you have to fast"
