  "title": "Should he pray 2 long rakats of Tahajjud or 8 small rakats (Quality or Quantity)? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "me so the question of akbar is what is more recommended quality or quantity well to abide by what the prophet allah used to observe and maintain throughout his life is the best and the prophet used to pray eight raka's every night and offer three raka's of witter generally speaking however this is not a must if someone finds that in one night he would like to prolong his prayer in two raka's or four rather than praying eight would we say that he's mistaken the answer is no whatever he finds his heart more inclined to do and he finds his hoshur and his contemplation upon the quran is far greater than any other way then he should do that especially when there is no restriction and allah knows best you"
