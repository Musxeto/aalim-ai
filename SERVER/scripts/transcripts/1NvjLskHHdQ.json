  "transcript": "Abu Muhammad from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Yes Sir I believe that you're asking about licking your plate Not that your tongue is so long that you go and wipe people's plates and yours as well And if this is your question, the answer is yes It is part of the sunnah and the etiquette that you clean and wipe your plate Whether with your fingers and lick your fingers for the barakah, the blessing of Allah Azza Wa Jal Unlike the posh people who say, this is disgusting, this is this, this is food This is Allah's blessing and provision for me I don't treat it as something that's irrelevant This is something Allah has given me So yes, it's part of the sunnah if you eat with your fingers That when you finish, you lick your fingers And if you finish eating from your plate, you clean it with your finger and lick your finger Or you can lick your plate as well But try your level best to choose when to do this Due to the fact that there are so many people that anticipate this Imagine if I'm doing this in a five stars hotel I'm going to do the sunnah And I grab the plate and start licking it in front of everybody And they're taking shots of me and posting it on the internet Oh the barbarian Muslims, look at what they're doing Did I do any good for Islam? Would they understand? No The media is waiting for you to slip To make a single mistake, magnify it and tarnish the reputation of Islam because of you So be careful in what you do As always, measure by the consequences So this is a sunnah If I don't do it, I'm not sinful But if I do it and this causes more harm than good Then I have lost the advantage and Allah knows best For more UN videos visit www.un.org"
