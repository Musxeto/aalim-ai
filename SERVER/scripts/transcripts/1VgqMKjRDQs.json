I don't know the name of the companion by the name of Shu'ayb, but probably the brother misread it. I don't know the name of Shu'ayb, but probably the brother misread it. I don't know the name of Shu'ayb, but probably the brother misread it. I don't know the name of Shu'ayb, but probably the brother misread it. I don't know the name of Shu'ayb, but probably the brother misread it. I don't know the name of Shu'ayb, but probably the brother misread it. I don't know the name of Shu'ayb, but probably the brother misread it. I don't know the name of Shu'ayb, but probably the brother misread it.
