  "transcript": "Naeem from Bangladesh. Sheikh, can I ask two questions? Can you give salam first? Sorry Sheikh, I forgot. I was waiting for so long. I'm still waiting for your salam. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, I am confused about the ruling on Sahoo Seizdah. Ruling of what? Sahoo Seizdah. What is that? Prostration of forgetfulness. Ah, Sujood Al-Sahoo. Okay. And my second question is, what is considered a beard in my face? What part is considered a beard? Okay, I will answer you the first question. You have only one question to ask. Sujood Al-Sahoo are two prostrations that are offered either before the salam, before you conclude your prayer, or after the salam, and then offer another salam. And it depends whether you have doubts that you cannot have a gut feeling to determine whether you did this or that, or if you have omitted one of the mandatory acts, like saying Subhan Rabbil Azeem in Ruku, you forgot, you did not say anything. Or you said Subhan Rabbil Azeem in Sujood instead of Subhan Rabbil A'la, and did not say one single time Subhan Rabbil A'la. So you've omitted a mandatory act. For these two scenarios, you prostrate twice after Durood Sharif, after salutation upon the Prophet, before you give salam, you offer two prostrations, and then you offer salam. The second situation where you offer it after the salam is when you have a gut feeling. Did I offer three rak'ahs or four rak'ahs? If you have a gut feeling that's three, or a gut feeling that it's four, act upon your gut feeling and prostrate after salam, because of the doubt. Or if you added something in your prayer, so for example, you prostrated twice, and instead of sitting, you prostrated a third prostration, and then you discovered, oops, this is a mistake. Or you stood up for the fifth rak'ah, and then you discovered you were wrong, you immediately sat down, finished your tashahhud, etc. Do your salam, then offer two prostrations of sahoo, then offer your salam again, and Allah knows best."
