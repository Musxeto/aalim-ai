  "title": "THE MASJID & ITS ETIQUETTES | Mombassa Dawah Tour Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "alhamdulillah [Music] the mid these are the houses of Allah and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala ordained and ordered us to build them so that his name was would be remembered and mentioned in these houses of Allah when the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam was asked he clearly mentioned that the mass are the best spots on earth and the most beloved to Allah so without any ambiguity or doubt whenever someone asks you what is the most beloved spot to Allah you say without thinking it is the Masjid this place we are in and building the Masjid by itself is a sign of Iman if a person builds a Masjid with the sole intention to get close to Allah this is a clear sign of Iman and building the masjids in Arabic has two meanings one building them physically putting brick on a brick and installing electricity and other facilities in a Masjid the other type is to pray and to occupy the Masjid and this is more important than building the actual building Because the actual building is a building it's good you can pray anywhere in a Masjid or without a Masjid so masjids without worshippers is not a good thing worshippers without Masjid yes that's good alhamdulillah they're Muslims they're practicing and they're doing whatever they can to do the first thing the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did when he went to Medina was to to establish a Masjid when he migrated to Medina and this is what all Muslims all over the world do whenever they migrate to a country whenever they go to a country they establish an Islamic Center or a Masjid because this is the beacon of light the generator of Islam and Iman among the community whenever you go to a country and you don't find a Masjid or an Islamic Center look at the Muslims and you rarely find them to be real Muslims they're just melted in the Melting Pot and they have become like everyone else but Subhan Allah when you go to a country and you find a Masjid and you find the community engaging in the activities of the Masjid you have strong Islam and a strong Muslim Community so the the Masjid has had a a very important role in Islam since the beginning since the history of Islam started in addition to it being a place of worship of Salat of and seclusion it had a huge role in uniting the um the prophet s used to spend a lot of the time in the Masjid not just worshiping rather conducting Circles of knowledge teaching his uh disciples solving problems arera in cases uh um solving disputes initiating war and conducting the armies and putting giving them the flag to set t for war and Jihad from the Masjid nowadays unfortunately the mid's role has been limited only for prayer in so many Muslim countries you pray 5 minutes 10 minutes after prayer the MU comes what we have to close this is not Kent Fried Chicken close what this is the house of Allah I'm here to pray I'm here to sit I want to worship from Allah so no we have to turn sometimes after F they just turn off the lights and the air conditioning and maybe if they had a bag of of of uh Black Mamba they will put it in the mid and you will have to run no this is not the real uh role of the Masjid so in a not as quick as possible we will try to go through some of the etiquettes of the masjids that we as Muslims have to have it in our DNA because so many of us especially the youth may not know these etiquettes of how to deal in the of of the Masjid first of all the most important thing in anything in Islam is sincerity Allah doesn't accept your Deeds if it was or if it is not sincere for him correct you do something to get gain the compliment and praise of people not for Allah Allah abandons you Allah does not accept it from you and this is why building a Masjid as beautiful as this has to have sincerity the prophet saidat whoever builds a Masid even if as small as the nest of a bird Allah will build him a house in jenah Subhan Allah building a Masjid Allah will build you a house in Jenna do I need a visa to go to my house alas you have the Visa you have residency so if you build it for the sake of Allah you're in good hands unfortunately in rich countries where I come from they build it to boast about it so people not all some of them build the house for for the sake of my mother my grandmother my father my and and they name it and the house is mashallah and he never prays one single prayer in it he lives next door what is this so why would do I pray I prayed I built it for the Muslims they all prayas it's enough I will get their reward I'll sleep no this doesn't work like that some of them even boast mashallah my Masid cost $2 million that's all my chandelier cost this much and much so they boast about it no there is nolas there has to beas and also among the etiquettes of the Masjid that when you come to the Masjid you have to come for the sake of Allah brother why are you here oh I'm here for the sake of Allah and you I'm here because uh I know the shikh is here I want to take a selfie what do you mean is famous I don't know him well I don't know the crap he's telling but everybody knows him so I just want to take a selfie and put it on my Facebook and this is why you come to the Masjid yeah then this is your fortune of coming to the Masjid and what about you there is a businessman I'd like to borrow some money so I pray next to him and I say pretend I'm crying so after Salat he says how are you sh S I have this that and then he may give me a loan maybe give me S so whatever your intention in coming for the Masjid is this is what's going to be your fruit and benefit the prophet saidat wasam whoever comes to a Masjid for a reason this reason is all what he will get what's your reason Allah you will get it what's your reason alone you will get Al loone but you will get zero at the side of Allah what's your reason well to do this worldly matters then you will not benefit anything of it because your intention was not sincere for Allah among the eates for coming to the Masjid is that you must be pure inside out what do you mean by pure Purity is divided into two types one is known as two known as it Rhymes H what does it mean is something sentimental something that is not physical that I am in the state of tahara so if I pass wind I have minor ritual impurity nobody saw it hopefully but in order to pray I can't pray like this what should I do make W this uplifts the minor impurity if I have a major ritual impurity caused by janaba again nobody can see that but I have to take a full G Shower to uplift this ritual impurity it's not physical so this is you cannot enter the Masjid when you have the major ritual impurity you cannot Haram okay I'm just just sitting here for half an hour waiting for a friend no go make and come back but if you are in the mind minor ritual impurity yes you can enter but you cannot sit down because one of the etiquet of entering the Masjid is that you don't sit until you pray two and if you're not in W how are you going to pray but you can enter you can enter just stand up or do something and walk around no problem part of the etiquette is that you be in this ritual impurity the second part is the physical impurity when you have NASA on your clothes on your body or on the spot you're praying in the prayer is invalid one single drop of urine on your clothes I can't pray in this I have to wash it or change it I have one drop of urine on my hand I have to wash it or H I can't amputate no I have to wash it I have Purity on the carpet I have to wash it or move aside the etiquette of Masjid is that you have to come pure in your clothes and you are in the state of wo in your state of tar listen to this beautiful Hadith the prophet saysat who by the way among you made W in his home raise your hands masallah tab Allah very good the prophet says this is for you H whoever purifies himself in his house then walks to one of the houses of Allah in order to offer one of the obligatory prayers enjoyed by Allah for every two steps he takes one will erase a sin and the other one will raise him one degree in status so if you live 500 steps from the from from the Masjid yeah 250 250 Subhan Allah who among us while walking is contemplating on upon this reward few the majority of us while walking well it's too humid today yeah it's too hot today and so many flies yeah yeah and the prices are going up and they come and they lose their even they're supposed to be in the positive now than the minus they have minus Deeds why enjoy the gift of Allah among the eates of the Masjid that you must avoid coming to it smelling stinky some of the brothers don't care about their personal hygiene yeah some people have odor for their body some of the brothers have oh dear when you pray next you you need oxygen tanks what is this and some some mids have this you know Subhan Allah why whatever you are doing in the Masjid be certain that the angels are surrounding us you don't see them they are all over the place Angels pure the prophet saysat wasam whoever eats garlic or onions let him not approach our Masjid and let him pray at home as the angels are offended by the same things that offend the humans what are you offended by bad smell so if someone is a chain smoker and he prays next to you how do you feel bad if someone is eating some of these sh tobacco or sh things or C or shab or I don't know what sh they call it weird things it has a very bad smell and the IM said he said a mean he said having a heart attack sometimes people go to in Saudi we have a bake one of the most beautiful Fried Chicken but you can't eat Al bake without garlics and people eat two three boxes of garlic and then they go to the IM sticks to the member the IM is trying to run away from the smell it is not permissible it is Haram for you to attend the Masjid when you're smelling like this because the angel are offended your brothers are offended and you want reward you want a but you are gaining sins pray home I spoke I asked she baz once this myself and I said Sheik sometimes I come home and the wife has cooked food and I'm hungry and the food has garlic mashallah or it has onions raw onions sometimes you can't eat fried fish without you know big onions like apples we eat them but this maybe yeah puts you out of service for 2 3 days smell is awful so is it permissible for me to go to the Masjid he said no so should I refrain from eating this food so that I can go to the message said no you can eat because this is once in a blue moon not every lunch you tell the wife put a lot of garlic so I can skip Salah no Nobody Does this no one in his right mind does this except someone who doesn't want to pray but once in a blue moon you f you like the food you eat it and it's time for prayer the sh says this is a legitimate reason in Shar for you to pray home you're not s in so alhamdulillah Allah gave us a way out but what was the scent and the smell of the prophet's hand and body beautiful sallallahu alaihi wasallam an Malik says I've Never Smell any beautiful in fragrance than the hand of the Prophet Alat wasam and he was described whenever he walked in an alley or a street people knew that yeah the prophet passed from here because of the beautiful fragrance every companion whoever described the prophet says he had a nice smell why this is our teacher sallallahu alaih wasallam now we as Muslims we have to follow suit we have to buy we have to buy deodorants we have to even apply body lotion she We're Men so what I apply body lotion after I shower I put body lotion musk one of the very expensive brand and whenever I go to a room they was here why because I want to follow myib sallallah alhi wasallam to jenah this is what he used to do and this leaves an impact on the Muslims when they say do you know so and so uh yeah the one who smells good instead of do you know so and so don't remind me don't remind me please this is problem always have clean clothes when you go to the gym yeah wear nice presentable and clean clothes some of the brothers have shirts when they go to the gym even before they put them on it stinks why I don't know I had it for 20 years only the fabric is out of date it's from the dinosaur era no you have to fear Allah and always have a good image among the eates of the Masjid is when you come to the Masjid you try to look presentable as much as possible is it m is it a must no yeah sometimes in F we get people coming to the Masjid in their pajamas is it haram no it's not Haram the is covered would you go and and meet the Prime Minister like this of course not the members of parliament of course not your father-in-law to be definitely not so why come to the Masjid wearing such attire at least and I'm not telling you to wear a three-piece suit and a tie but at least wear something presentable to the Masid because Allah says oh children of Adam take your adornment that is wear your clothings at every Masid and also use perfume use your mwak and the best of clothes you wear is white I usually never wear anything but white but because I'm traveling I'm wearing these colored thobes because it saves me from washing it every half an hour so I can wear this inshallah without ironing it and and and doing the nine yards among the eates when coming to the Masjid is you walk with uh tranquility and uh uh dignity some of the brothers you see them like running the marathon especially in Friday they skip the first they come in the middle of the second and they run just to achieve one raak with the IM why are you doing this lazy no this is not befitting the Allah the prophet saidat wasam when you come to pray you must be dignified you walk in a dignified manner whatever you catch up with pray and whatever you miss complete don't hasten don't run some of the brothers join you in the in the row in the line I mean two three ra why because he was running what what did you achieve from your Salah nothing therefore focus is on quantity not on quality and this is why we have bad names if you focus on your business in your business on quality people will come to you but when you focus on quantity I just want to pray as many as possible like the prophet said Al they pray so many that you companions will look down upon yourselves and say these guys are really good however they do not have anything related to Islam it's quantity while if you pray two raas you don't say anything or get distracted in Allah will forgive all of your sins two so Quant quality versus quality part of the etiquet of entering the Masjid is to enter it with your right foot and we always use the right for things of Honor in Islam the prophet said whenever you eat eat with your right hand whenever you drink drink with your right hand whenever you give give with your right hand and whatever you take take with your right hand because shatan eats and drinks and gives and takes with his left so many Muslims we see them when they're eating they eat with their left what is this eate sh hold the fork with the left hold the knife with the right you cut and you eat some of them eat with the right like here Mah they eat with their hand which is Sunnah but then when they want to drink no look look use their left why oh sh my right hand is dirty yeah but your left hand is dirtier because Shan is drinking with you so what to do hold it with your dirty hand and drink with your right nothing held by your left goes to your mouth ever so likewise we honor the right so when you enter the Masjid you use your right foot when you leave the Masjid you leave it with your left when you enter the toilet you enter it with your left but when you leave the toilet you leave it with with your right foot and also when you're entering the Masjid you say the appropriate VI the prophet says when someone when one of you enters the Masid he should say in another narration say open the gates of your mercy and when you leave I ask you of your favor and Grace and another narration also the prophet saidat when you enter the Masjid say oh Allah I seek refuge in your Noble continence and your Eternal Authority from the accursed Satan when you see say these four phrases Shan says no good he's protected from me the whole day if you say these beautiful words again the prophet says now we're in the Masjid whenever you enter the Masjid Do not sit until you pray two a lot of the brothers ignore this and they come and sit down why are you doing this out of arrogance they say uh it's a difference of opinion mashallah now you're a sheh the prophet said Do not sit until you pray two ra uh yes but Moana Im so and so says it's okay I'm telling you the prophet said Do not sit and you say maana said who are you following and and these people's nuts they have something loose whenever the Hadith comes you have no right to reject it once the prophet was giving came and sat down the prophet stopped his Friday he said sik did you pray two he said no said stand up and pray ordering him to stand up and pray what does this tell you it's recommended it is mandatory to pray among the eates of being in the Masjid is that you do not annoy others and the prophet said and the Hadith was narrated by bukari and Muslim the Angels pray for one of you so long as he remains in the place where he prayed all of you prayed M correct and the angels are praying for you each and every one of you they're recording and the meter is scking because you are doing this but there is a condition they say oh Allah forgive him oh Allah have mercy on him so long as he does not commit a sin there huh what kind of a sin some of us while listening to theba or watching uh theba takes his mobile and checks his Instagram and he may see something he likes it and comments on it yeah list little I'm going to listen to the she yeah I'm listening I'm listening this is sinful so the angels will not ask Allah for forgiveness as long as he does not commit a sin there so long as he does not cause annoyance to others so in order for the angels to ask Allah for forgiveness you must not annoy those be beside you how do I annoy those beside me picking your nose what are you doing it's raining what what are you doing to me oh it's okay sorry sorry sorry or annoying the brother every time hitting him doing this doing that no this is annoying some of the brothers annoy you by reading the Quran he's next to you and he we in the Masid I want to read the Quran myself especially on J on Friday everybody's reading Surah Al and he's louder than me I have to put on the fifth gear like brother Ahmed today in the in the conference he put the fifth gear and he goes and okay and he hears this he goes and raises his voice as well and it's becom a competition who are you doing this for is not Halal you are calling Allah and Allah is close Allah is most hearing he hears everything and Allah responds so when you and and we have these wackos in Haram when we go make you find them in groups Allah and they you know shout their lungs out what are you doing oh we're in and the whole Masjid is this is not Islam this is not Islam you're annoying people you are harming them Allah told you to be uh soft in what you are doing listen to this Hadith the prophet once was in seclusion 10 last nights of Ramadan while he was in his tent he heard them reciting the Quran loudly he came out and he said listen all of you is calling Allah do not harm one another do not annoy one another do not raise your voices against one another because you are calling someone who's not deaf and who is not far and he is close all hearing and responding this is Allah so why are you raising your voice like this it is Shan doing this for you may Allah protect us and among the eates of the Masjid that we come and attain the first raw lazy people come early and they sit at the back not not you guys I know you can they choose pillars they choose wall s to just you know put their backs on them the first row is empty say yeah yeah but you know it's close to the exit and after the mom says and the guys when he said they're already in their cars going to the fish market to buy lunch for the the no this is not the appropriate way the prophet saysat if the people knew what there is of reward in the call the aan and the first draw and they could find no other way than drawing Lots then they would draw Lots the reward is so high the people are self-sufficient you come to the Masjid you find especially in Arabia you find 50 people sitting before the aan and the time of of the aan is already 5 minutes do and you say is did anybody call thean said no the he did not come they turn on the AC's the lights okay why wouldn't anyone give the Adan oh no no I I don't know how to make the Adan some of them are uncles give the Adan youngsters come give the Adan no no no I don't I may make a mistake none of them wants to give the aan but if someone tells them American Got Talent they want someone to you know uh perform oh yeah yeah I know I know I know how to juggle uh oranges they have no problem Subhan Allah in religious things they take the back seat in worldly disgusting things they would like to come to the Forefront and this is wrong among the eates of the Salat you cannot sell and buy and what is selling and buying people think that we can't talk no you can't talk in the Masjid you can ask him what did you do in the test yesterday you can ask him how is your father is he fine or not you can ask him what you did your neighbors do did they divorce did they normal talk is okay Halal talk what is not Halal is to bargain how much you're selling your car uh 20 oh that's too much yeah she I'm interested in buying make it 19 so no 19 is to the model is old and we're in the house of Allah you have to give me discount this is totally Haram the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said if you see someone selling or buying in the Masjid make Dua in his face tell him in his face may Allah make your trade losing and at loss because he's disrespecting Allah and likewise if someone after the Salah stands up uh Brothers I was making woodo and I lost my watch have you seen my watch anybody has seen my watch it's a this this type the prophet saidat whoever Hears A man making a Lost Property announcement in the Masjid let him say may Allah not restore it to you w why the prophet says for masjids were were not built for this purpose so many times we sit in the Masjid in the first row we're making Dua we're reading Quran and one comes next to youum you think is a good will Wisher how are you alhamdulillah and then he can you give a big smile and he says W I have a lot of debt and you know I can't pay the rent what are you doing the Masid is for Allah and you're disgracing the Masjid by asking me yeah I asked him but I could not get a response so maybe you will give me something a help can get out of my face this is not Halal we have to respect the masjids among the mistakes that many of us do is that we want the first row but we're too lazy so we come 5 minutes before the aan for the and the Masjid is full what do we do we start you know jumping hurdles like the race the 400 meter and the guy excuse me excuse me and he hits your head he hits his shoulder and he comes here the full row is completely blocked Full House in he goes from the please yes yes please please please until he gets his a small space and squeezes himself annoying the whole Masjid this is Haram yes but I want the first row want the first row come at 10:00 no 10:00 I'm I'm sleep wake up no no I'd like to sleep until 12:30 I come and I get a place in the first row you are making a sin the prophet was giving and a man was doing this jumping the shoulders and the necks of worshippers who were sitting he said to him sit you have come late and you have harmed others you did two things you came late and in addition you've harmed others no sit at the end of the Masjid she there is no place in the Masjid when I used to give the Masid was maybe 8 times as big as this but I used to come 15 minutes earlier than schedule 12:30 I come and give at 12:15 because this is one of the saying of the scholars that the prophet used to give before the time of by half an hour an hour and the say it is permissible so I used to come early so we set the people early so they come from all of jida to come because I start early and they can leave early while everybody's in the masjids listening to the when I come and say everybody is standing up at the back the Masid is fully packed so I tell them please come closer so that the gaps are narrowed and people can come and sit in front of in in the Masjid instead of sitting outside and then you see people start this gazelle way of jumping and I said no you can't do this as long as alhamdulillah you came late and there is place at the back stand up the is only 10 to 15 minutes stand up if you cannot sit down but don't cross and annoy and the worshippers and commit his sin the cleanliness of the Masjid is a factor in Islam it's a condition real Muslims would not sit around and find finding any threads or always Subhan Allah and always the people from the subcontinent are the best in this wherever they are in the Masjid you find them sitting in the Masjid reading making Dua and if they see something stealthly they go put it in their pocket they just keep on collecting why because they know that collecting and cleaning the Masjid is one of the things that Allah rewards immensely also among the etiquet that you occupy your time in the Masjid only by remembering Allah making Vick reading the Quran avoid reading news on your dull stupid phones or smartphones some people ra read the news uh answer uh uh WhatsApp messages and and occupy themselves in worldly things you are in the House of Allah devote your time for Allah and with this we conclude the beautiful Hadith of the Prophet among the eates of the Masjid that before I conclude that you try your level best not to bring children to the Masjid however no one has the right to scold or to reprimand someone who brought their children see there's a balance yes I'm a parent I am not supposed to bring my infant to the Masjid because I know that my infant would make cries and annoys the people attending however if I am thick or if I have a reason that no one knows about and I bring my child to the Masjid everyone in the Masjid should respect this you don't have the right to say what are you doing you're wrong you're this you're that I remember once I was in my Masjid and while praying a child started to cry as a as someone who knows the Hadith I concluded my prayer like a jet plane quickly finished my prayer in like 5 minutes of course the majority said keep up the good work she wow this is good man I wasn't anticipating Landing this early why did I do this because the prophet was praying once and he heard a child cry so he immedi imately concluded and hastened his Salah and when he finished the companion said du wh what what what why is this he said I heard a child cry so I hastened my Salat fearing for the heart of the child's mother Allah abbar he did not care about the worshippers because the worshippers want to pray he cared about the heart of the mother who is you know dying to take care of her child this is the mercy sent to mankind so this is the Sunnah you hear the child crying conclude your prayer quickly so when I did what I have done unfortunately every Masjid has Elders uncles one of the uncles you know he's like 250 years old masah he stood up and said why do you bring your child he started shouting and and and and and uh reprimanding the man the man had a 5-year-old girl and I think a three-year old girl and the man did not say anything he just carried his children and went out of the door but the uncle made a sin out of it and everyone he made a sin by raising his voice in the Masjid you're not allowed to I'm a sheh I'm giving you a sermon I raise my voice as I want you can't you cannot sue me you cannot touch me alhamdulillah but you can't see this is one of the advantages of being a Sheikh so immediately after making such a scene I went from my special door out and to meet this man so I met the man alayum forgive the uncle they don't understand you know and these guys are so old H and they have temper and they don't have diplomacy and maybe this or that so please forgive him W the man started to cry wall I don't know him he was in his mid-30s he started to weep and cry he said what should I do yeah I don't know what to do my wife left me and my children four months ago and I'm almost getting sacked of my job because no one is going to take care of my kids I have to work in the morning but who will sit with the kids and nobody's taking care of them my family their family and I felt once in four months that I wanted to pray to Allah I came to the Masid and this is what happened Subhan Allah when you don't feel your brothers what they're suffering don't judge people don't jump the gun and consider yourself always right maybe he did this maybe he did that maybe he had circumstances you never know so when you hear a child cry don't start to blame or to look you know some of the sisters I know they would look at the sister who has a child like witches you know you getting horns and maybe their their broom Gro I don't know they have this some of the sisters are evil the brothers are mashallah the uncles no but this Masjid inshallah they're good uncles are safe and let's let me leave in peace inshallah nothing happens to me so this is the best way of doing it that you don't bring the children in but if they come and they C cause confusion don't scare them so many of us children when they are 15 years of age said why don't you pray in the Masjid he said well I remember two years ago one of the uncles slapped me on the face because I was playing around one of the uncles pulled me from the row and he said no don't spray in the first row one of the uncles shouted at me one of the uncles scolded me remember your action has consequences"
