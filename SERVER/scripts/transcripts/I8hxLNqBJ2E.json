  "title": "Can someone buy (bribe) a government job to provide for family if they are qualified?",
  "transcript": "Can someone buy a government job so that he can take care of himself and his family if the person is very capable of doing the job? Thank you. This is not buying. This is bribing. Bribe is prohibited and a major sin in Islam. The Prophet ï·º said, La'anallahu ar-rashiyya wal-murtashiyya, may Allah curse the one who gives the bribe and the one who receives it. So it is totally prohibited to give a bribe to secure a government job. Now the problem is that if we have a problem in our country and everything is done through bribing and if you tell us not to bribe that would cause a lot of hardship if not disastrous implications because I cannot get a driving license without bribing. I'm willing to wait for six months, for a year, but even if I wait they will not give me. They will always fail me even if I am Michael Schumacher, one of the best race drivers. They will still fail me. I cannot get a seat in the university. I cannot get a job in the government. So in this case if the whole country is corrupt and things are not facilitated without giving a bribe to get what is lawfully yours, I'm not getting somebody else's share or trying to steal someone else's rights, rather it's my own right that I'm trying to salvage. It seems that if you are qualified for the job and there is no other way but through bribing, inshallah this is permissible and Allah knows best."
