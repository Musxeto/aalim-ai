  "title": "Found out Qunoot in Fajr is an innovation, so now I do not offer it,  is this correct?",
  "transcript": "naim says he used to offer kunut in fajr prayer like all the shafi'i people in indonesia and in malaysia and elsewhere so he came to know that this is weak and he stopped what's your opinion what you've done by leaving is the right thing which the prophet assalam died not offering it which abu bakr umar uthman and ali never offered it so what you're doing is following the sunnah and you are on the right track"
