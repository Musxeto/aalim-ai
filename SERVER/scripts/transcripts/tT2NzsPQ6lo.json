  "transcript": "but my last comment would be to those who refuse to take the vaccine now the conspiracy theorists keep on refusing to take the vaccines and unfortunately i know duat i know students of knowledge who till date refuse to take the vaccines why they don't want to it's conspiracy there is a problem there is a trick in it okay then prove to me again that all what's happening is not a conspiracy around us they lose great reward when they cannot go to umrah or hajj they lose great rewards when they cannot travel and give lectures and and and participate in conferences the funny thing is look how shaytan messes up with their heads they even come and ask okay can we lie and make a forged or fake certificate that we had had been vaccinated subhanallah now you want to sin in order to justify your actions this is not realistic every single child have been vaccinated at birth from polio from smallpox from hepatitis i think all the whole nine yards and nobody ever stopped their children from being vaccinated all of us have been vaccinated why is it this that you're rejecting well because there's a game behind it i agree but the vast majority of the people has have had taken it i personally took the first two shots like eight months ago and i was blessed to perform hajj among 60 000 on earth who were able to perform hajj last year i was blessed by allah i was blessed to be able to travel and to perform umrah once every month for the past year i took the booster shot last week only one week exactly from today and i'm still kicking i have no energized buddy in me so come on guys i need don't make an issue out of an issue you've losing umrah you're losing the chance to go for hajj just because i don't want to be vaccinated up to you but don't start bending rules in order to justify this claim or refusal of yours you"
