  "title": "Itikaf on odd nights or 10 straight nights to get Laylatul Qadr",
  "transcript": "Mushtaaba from the US. So yeah I have a question regarding Aitikaf in the Qadr. So I just want to know that can we sit Aitikaf like we have to sit on in odd days in Masjid or we have to sit Aitikaf for 10 straight days? Okay, first of all Aitikaf is a highly recommended sunnah and the Prophet ï·º in the beginning did Aitikaf in the first ten nights of Ramadan, then he made it in the middle ten nights of Ramadan, then he continued to make it in the last ten nights of Ramadan, the full ten nights. So this is the sunnah. Secondly, no one knows when Laylatul Qadr is, so it can be in odd numbers, nights, and it can be in even number nights, because this is dependent on the month of Ramadan. Is it 29 or 30? So when it's 29 the odd numbers differ than when it's 30 because we detect the odd numbers by taking out the last ten nights of the month. So when it's 29 the last ten nights is different when then it's 30. So the odd and even numbers are not known until the month is over then we can tell. Therefore it is wrong for people just to go every night of the 21st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th thinking that definitely Laylatul Qadr is one of them. No it's not. It can be of the 20th, 22nd, 4th, 6th and 8th and 30th depending on the month is 29 or 30 days and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
