  "title": "Swearing to other than Allah Shirk? Swearing by mother, father, the Prophet ‎ﷺ | Assim Al Hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "there are many people who swear by the prophet salallahu salaam by their deceased mother or by their daughters and stuff like that so i want to know is it shirk to square by other than allah and why jazakallahu a man from lebanon she says what's the ruling on swearing with other than allah swearing with other than allah is divided into two types minor so minor shirk is when you swear by other than allah azzawajal randomly or not believing that that person you're swearing by can fulfill the things that allah can fulfill and you don't believe in him as you believe in allah azzawajal for example people swear by al-a mana they say they swear by the prophet like in egypt they always say with navi and none of them intend that the prophet sallam is equivalent to allah that we can swear by him but it's something that is random used on their tongues this is prohibited some in syria and jordan and in lebanon like nariman is calling from they say usharaf all of this is haram this is because they don't believe that they are equivalent to allah azza but rather they use this now sometimes a person may believe that the one who he is swearing by is equivalent to allah and this is total major shirk so and they give the scholars give an example if you caught a thief red hat red-handed so he says i didn't steal so he swears by allah he did not steal so a smart person who knows the the thief he says swear by al-badawi or or by ali and the guy says oh no no no no it's getting serious no i can't yeah i did steal this is why because he glorifies them similarly to his glorification of allah or even more and this is major shirk and i hope this answers your question"
