No, no, no, haram, this is not for Muslims, Muslims they clip their nails, this is Sunnah, this is fitrah, some men you see them wearing, you know, I don't know what they call it, top tank or... No, no, the t-shirts that has no sleeves, and sometimes they say Salaam Alaikum, you see MashaAllah jungles.
