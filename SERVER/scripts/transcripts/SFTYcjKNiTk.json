  "transcript": "Aminata says if a woman dies and leaves wealth can the husband inherit the money the issue of inheritance is not a place or a subject of fatwa usually because this was placed and finalized by Allah soldier what does this mean a person dies what should we do with his wealth this is something that Allah Himself decided so first of all we asked the person who died did he leave parents did he have a spouse did he have offspring and we look into the data given and allocate the inheritance accordingly so now the question of Aminata is not clear if a woman dies her husband inherits but what does he inherit everything there is definitely no he inherits one of two percentages either he inherits half of her wealth providing she had not have she had not had any offspring of her own if she has parents no problem if she had siblings no problems our problem with the husband is did she have children from him or from anyone else before the answer is no he gets half if she had one child or more whether from him or from a previous marriage in this case the husband gets quarter of her wealth this is given other than that we have to look at her parents at her siblings at her offspring and decide accordingly"
