  "title": "If I tell someone I am making Dua for them, will angels stop making Dua for me?",
  "transcript": "so is it like Dua that I should keep for myself so that the angel would say and you have a similar amount so that when I make Dua for my brother o Allah I pray to you that you uh pay off his debts there is an angel appointed by Allah to say I mean to my Dua and to you similar to what you have made Dua for your brother so the norm is I make Dua for you I don't come and tell you that I'm doing Dua for you every night no problem because then the angel would stop saying I mean and making Dua for me I should conceal this"
