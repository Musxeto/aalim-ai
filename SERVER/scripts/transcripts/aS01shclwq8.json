  "transcript": "Now, I'm directing the next question to Sheikh Asim about the community itself. Because Sheikh Asim, sometimes, when someone has been hit with calamity or disaster or something like that, people like to comment. For example, they say this is because Allah punishes you. Some other might say that, no, this is because it's a test for you. So, what is the best for the community when someone or some calamities or musibah hit from others? So, as a Muslim brothers, a Muslim community, how do we respond to this? There is no one size that fits all. It depends on the situation. It depends on the calamity. Sometimes, when a woman comes and complains of her husband's betrayal, you give her an answer different to someone who lost his wealth or someone who is terminally and chronically ill. So, there are different situations. All in all, we try our level best not to be rude. In the sense that, this is your sin. You deserve this. You deserve this. Because you allowed your husband to go to free mixing and Allah, Azza wa Jal, punished you by him marrying two, three, four wives. You go to a sick person and say, yeah, these are the sins that you've done five, ten years ago. And you post it on Instagram. Now, you have to pay. Payback is something bad. And so, this is not the right way of doing it. Like the Shaykh said, you have to give the glad tidings. You have to be optimistic. You have to show people how Allah is merciful and bring them back to Allah, Azza wa Jal. And, at the same time, walk a very thin line by showing them that this is a test from Allah. So, you have to endure that test. Whenever the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, visited a sick person, what would he say? May this be a means of purification. So, this is a means of purification because Allah is erasing your sins. As a community, we have to stand by one another. So, if a person is in a calamity and he's starving, and you go to him and say, MashaAllah, Tabaraka Allah, look at you, you're getting thin. Allahumma Barik, MashaAllah, it's a good diet you're giving. This is for your digestive problems. And you give him something to help his digestion. The guy is not even finding food and you're giving him digestive medication. You have to stand by them. When they're in need of food, you feed them. When they're in need of medicine, you give them. When they're in need of money to pay their rent or to pay their utility bills, you give them from Zakat, from Sadaqah, you lend them money. So, you stand by your brother or your sister as if you are a firm, strong wall, one next to the other, like bricks. This is how we stand with the communities and Allah knows best."
