  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Sri Lanka my question today \nis so we know that people who are reverts and   converts to Islam from other religions once they \nlike accept Islam all their past sins are forgiven   and whatever sins that they may have committed \nin their ignorance in this has been forgiven so   uh is it the same for the Muslim person who was a \nMuslim born Muslim and raised who committed almost   the same levels of sin and repented to Allah with \nhis sins also be forgiven or should he like uh   come like say shahada and everything and come to \nIslam in order to reach that level of forgiveness   so if I understand brother Abdul \naziz's question is the comparison   between a person who reverted to Islam who was \noriginally a disbeliever and accepted Islam   as mentioned in Surat al-furqan Allah azzawajal \nwould transform his sins into Good Deeds   and that's a huge gain and reward so he's asking \nwhat about an original Muslim if he was an open   sinner he committed so many major sins and he \nrepented will Allah azzawajal also transform his   bad deeds into Good Deeds similarly to the person \nwho accepted Islam there is an issue of dispute   some Scholars say yes some Scholars say no and \nwe Depend and rely entirely on Allah azzawajal the generous the most forgiving the most merciful \nso it is not beneficial for us to go into details   especially with those who have a problem up here   I had sessions with people who were so despaired \nof their sins that shaytan managed to trick them   into committing acts of apostasy and leaving \nIslam so that when they return to Islam   all of their sins they've committed \nwould be transformed into Good Deeds   and this is outrageous how would a Muslim commit \nan act of apostasy just to get more reward   this definitely indicates that this person is not \nonly a delusional rather he is not a real Muslim   because this goes against his true DNA \nto commit kuffer just to get more reward   of course this is not acceptable or uh um \napproved by anyone to be done so trust Allah   if you were engaged in major sins in the past and \nnow you've repented you've expressed sincere and   deep remorse you pledged not to go back to such \nsins and life and you sought Allah's forgiveness   and you're still seeking it and you're doing good \ndeeds rest assured that Allah will forgive your   sins and that his generosity subhanahu wa ta'ala \nis unlimited and if he wills it he will transform   your previous sins into Good Deeds but don't \nmake this your prerogative don't make this your   Target rather repent and feel deep remorse and do \ngood deeds and inshallah you will be in good hands"
