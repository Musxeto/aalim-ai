That's the question I have no idea what you're talking Akhi If you can speak in clear English I would appreciate it Oh sorry sorry sorry When you make a Dua Do you have to say what you want verbally? You have to say what you want verbally Or how would you make a Dua? Just by thinking about it? Hamza? Yeah that's not the right way You have to say it verbally Yeah so when you want to make Dua You have to verbalize it You can't just stay there Look at the ceiling and Make Duas in your head No this is not valid You have to actually articulate it Say You have to verbalize it and say it"
