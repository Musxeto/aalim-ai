  "transcript": "Gulab from UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Hi Sheikh, I want to know like an ordinary Muslim if he practices Islam, he does all the basic stuff he needs to do but you know at the end of the day we will know our Rasool on the Day of Judgment but on this lab how can we know if Allah is happy and what we are doing and satisfied and accepting are there any signs or is there something that we cannot know? There isn't anything tangible Gulab that we can confirm that yes 100% Allah Azza Wa Jal is pleased with me I am a righteous person, I am a God-fearing person, Allah loves me, I am one of Allah's Awliya No, that is too easy and life would not go on smoothly like this, this is arrogance to say so a Muslim is balanced between the fear of Allah, Allah is going to put me in Hell for my sins and shortcomings and the hope in Allah, Allah will put me in Paradise with the Prophet Alayhi Salaam for the good deeds I am doing so he is balanced, he is afraid and hopeful at the same time now there isn't anything tangible but there are signs one of the signs would be that Allah always support you and help you to do righteous deeds so a person who finds that it's easy for him to go and pray in the first row in Fajr prayer and Dhuhr and Asr and Maghrib and Isha and he finds love to the Masjid, he finds love to sit between Maghrib and Isha reading the Qur'an one or two or three Juz' he finds ease in himself to reach out and give money to the poor and help the orphans and a stranded widow pay her rent he finds a lot of comfort in attending lectures and circles of knowledge and he is a down to earth person, he is kind, he is mellow, people praise him all the time these are excellent signs that Allah loves you among the clearest of all signs that Allah loves you is that you follow the Prophet's Sunnah to the letter no innovation, no corruption in Aqeedah you're following the Prophet's footsteps Alayhi Salaam to the letter why? Allah says in the Qur'an say, if you love Allah Azza wa Jal, then follow me, the Prophet Alayhi Salaam Allah will love you so an indication that Allah loves you is that you're in full compliance of the Prophet Alayhi Salaam you do not cherry pick oh, I like growing the beard because when people see me they respect me and give me their position in their role or in their line but I don't like night prayer because I have to wake up and sleep early and blah blah blah so no, don't cherry pick, you are in full compliance with the Sunnah among other things, and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best www.mooji.org"
