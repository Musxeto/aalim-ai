  "transcript": "uh question number six from the whatsapp is a woman allowed to demand continuous mahar for example x amount of the husband's salary this is according to an agreement and this is not part of the mahar because if she wants to go for hulu she will not be able to pay all of this money back to him but this would be a condition in the marriage so her was a thousand dollars that's separate but then she had the condition that he gives her a monthly allowance of five hundred dollars and he agreed as long as he agreed and is approved and authenticated and documented in the contract it's a binding condition he has to give her every month five hundred dollars if he were to decline or to stop she has the right to go for divorce and there's nothing wrong in that and allah knows best you"
