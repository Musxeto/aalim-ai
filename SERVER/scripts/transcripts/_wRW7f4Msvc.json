  "title": "Can we make Wudu with oil or gel on our hair? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "no ha says can we make wudu with oil on our hair is the wood all valid we know that in order for your wood to be valid is that your organs are washed and there is no layer between the water and your skin so if I have a big paint spot on my hand and I perform wobble my rule is invalid because the paint is a layer that prevents water from going and reaching my skin likewise if a woman has nail varnish or nail polish this is a hard substance that prevents water from reaching your nails whether it's breathable or none breathable this is all bogus it prevents water from reaching years your nails and your water is invalid there is an exception of two things one of wiping over the socks because the sunna permits that so I did not wash my feet rather I simply wiped over them in woudl this is valid providing that I wore the socks after performing ablution so I am in the state of minor ritual purity I'm in the state of Woodill I put them on now next time I make wudu I can wipe over them and there are a number of other conditions the other exception is wiping over the hair because wiping does not mean washing it is a more simpler way of doing it so we have authentic hadith stating that the Prophet erase a lot awesome he went for Amla and for Hajj he used to put a substance similar to glue on his hair and this substance keeps the hair intact and fixed he's travelling for a couple of weeks time so he definitely performed Woodill which means that wiping over this substance is okay and legit nowadays we have hair gel - those who use it I don't have hair to use it so I don't know how it is implemented but those who do do you see that their hair is so stiff and fixed it cannot move even if they jump or fall it's fixed so such Jill prevents water from reaching the hair but you can wipe on that without any problem when performing Hustle this is not sufficient you have to wash it off to ensure that the water reaches every single hair and your scalp as well so if you have henna on your hair you just applied henna and it has to stay for an hour to show that the color sticks and it's time for prayer with the henna on your head there's no problem in wiping over it if you have hair Jill there's no problem if you have oil it is also permissible and Allah knows best"
