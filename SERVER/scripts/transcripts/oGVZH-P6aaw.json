  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi How are you? Alhamdulillah Sheikh, I once asked you about upholding title of kinship and you said something which made big impact You said I might not know my second cousins at all and this If I follow this, this makes things much easier So I have like another specific question Is it okay if I don't know my parents' cousins at all? Like they are not angry, it's just the culture So in Germany it's like non-Muslim culture and in Morocco it's I don't know whether it's normal but I think most of them I didn't see them ever And like is it also okay, so just this question, is it okay if I don't know them at all? No problem if you don't get to see them, if you don't get to talk to them, if you don't visit them If they live in another country, there's no problem But if they live in the same neighborhood and they share the same name with your father and your mother And they're male to you, just giving them a call or visiting them or honoring your kinship would be fine But yes, if they don't meet, they don't visit, you don't see one another, you don't interact Except in Eid, every blue moon, or if they live in a foreign country, there's no problem with that inshallah"
