  "transcript": "Yassin from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wassalamu Alaikum Sheikh my question is what's the difference between having doubts in religion and extreme waswasa? Jazak Allah Khairan Wa Jazak This is too generic, but generally speaking, doubts that are related to the fundamentals of Islam, does Allah exist? Is Quran the word of Allah? Is the Prophet ï·º the messenger? This invalidates your Islam. Because part of knowing the meaning of ashhadu wa la ilaha illallah, to have certainty. And when you're doubtful, I don't know the Quran, I don't know if it's perfect or not. Then you're not a real Muslim. Waswasa can come in such issues, but you block it. And you say I have full conviction and Iman in these things, I'm not going to think about it. That's it. End of story. There's no problem on your Iman. Waswasa could come in things that require knowledge. Why is it that man can marry four women and a woman cannot marry except one man? I don't know what's this, but this is the Quran, this is Islam. I believe in it, but I have these doubts. Come, I'll clarify it for you. You ask scholars, students of knowledge, they'll clarify such doubts. These doubts are normal. Why do women get half the men in inheritance? Why is this ruling halal? Why is it mandatory to remove pubic hair and armpit hair while it is prohibited to touch your beard? It's all hair on the body. These doubts can be answered. According to Quran, the Sunnah, there's no problem. But doubts that are related to the essence of Islam and the Quran, and doubting the meaning of it, doubting facts of it, this invalidates one's religion if not blocked and ignored. And Allah Azawajal knows best."
