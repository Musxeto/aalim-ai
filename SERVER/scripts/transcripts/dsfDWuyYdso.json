  "transcript": "hamza from bosnia if there are two strong opinions about an issue are we allowed to use both of them interchangeably for example we know there are two strong opinions about the action of our index finger during the shahood one from sahih muslim and the other one conveyed from even may allah be pleased with him so would it be permissible to use one of those opinions in one prayer and the other opinion in another player or must be stick only to one opinion as long as you know that one of these opinions is most authentic no you cannot interchange between them so the hadith of is more authentic than the hadith of abdullah zubair for example where he says that he used to point and not move it so we know for sure that the hadith of pointing and moving it while supplicating and making dua is more authentic so you have to stick with that you cannot play around with these two on the account that one is more authentic but if there is an issue and you are not certain which one is most authentic and they're exactly equal to one another and you cannot determine you cannot follow your sheikh who determines for you and it's almost 50 50. in this case whatever you do acceptable and valid and allah azza knows best you"
