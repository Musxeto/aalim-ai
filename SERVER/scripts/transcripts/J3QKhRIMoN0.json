  "transcript": "Ismail from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, I was saying that my exams finished some time ago, so I was thinking like I'll start teaching people. So I found some people online. I want to teach online without showing the face, the camera. So I went, I found some people and I started, like a person, I started contacting them. And then after like, I was about to like, I found out in the end that it's a female. So even if I do online with them without showing my face, just share my screen, teach them, but then khalas, and maybe even like tell them nature about the notes and stuff, is this allowed? If it's one-to-one, no, it's not allowed. Because this is not a necessity. She can get her teaching elsewhere from another female. If there are more than one, and there is no mixing, and you're just doing your job, there's no seclusion inshaAllah, and there's no problem in that."
