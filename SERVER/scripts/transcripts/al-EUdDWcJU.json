  "title": "Is it best to be patient, rely on Allah and not seek medical help? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Roma says I heard of a hadith where a woman went to the Prophet Alice awesome to make dua for her to cure her illness but the Prophet said sallallaahu Selim to her that if she would be patient instead she would get Jenna can you please explain this hadith does it mean that it is best to be patient and not to seek medical help this is an issue of dispute is it mandatory to take medicine and to get treated the majority say that this is not mandatory it can be really commended and it can be permissible and sometimes it's not recommended so when the chances are 50/50 of recovery leaving it is best because you're trusting Allah when the possibility of recovery is 25% then it is not only best it might be mandatory for you not to go for it because the risk is far greater than the possibility of recovery and if the recovery rate is higher like 80% 90% then it is highly recommended to accept it and to get treated unless if you don't get treated you will die or have something serious happening to you in this case it becomes mandatory so if I'm bleeding and I'm refusing to treat my wound to stop blood from continuing to come up and out and kill me if I don't do this I'm sinful it is a must for me to treat it if there's a need to amputate one of my limbs otherwise it will cause my whole body to be affected and die as a consequence then it is a must to get treated and to amputate that organ but if it's a normal 50/50 chance maybe maybe not this is up to you it's allowed to do it and if you want to refrain then this is permissible the hadith brother Rama is referring to is the hadith of a black woman who used to have seizures so she came to the Prophet Alice awesome and said o prophet of Allah pray to Allah that I recover from my seizures so the Prophet looked adding a solid salam to the rewards knowing that if he makes dua she'll be recovered but if he doesn't make duaa and she is patient her seizures would erase all the time sins and give her good deeds so he gave her the choice if you wish I'll ask Allah Allah for you but if you are patient and I don't make dua for you Allah will admit you to Jenna so the woman said okay prophet of Allah I'll be patient I want Jenna this is what I am living on earth for this is my final destination I hope so yes don't make dua for me but when I have these seizures I fall down and my clothes may expose my aura because I'm unaware of what's happening to me so pray to Allah that when I have my seizures that my aura is not displays displayed or exposed so the Prophet made dua for her scholars say that this is an indication that tolerating pain for the sake of Allah as erosion is something that is reward about something that is recommended and that seeking healing and cure for your illness is not mandatory as we've stated in the beginning and Allah knows best"
