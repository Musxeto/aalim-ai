  "title": "Sexual Intercourse during fasting in Ramadan and its Expiation (Kaffara)| Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a husband and the wife are supposed to fast for two months consecutively because they broke fast early as a result of intimacy during the fasting hours of Ramadan the wife tried not to give in to the desires but ended up giving in as to not anger her husband can the couple substitute some days of fasting with feeding the poor what are some of the ways that they can make up for this nullified fast other than fasting for two months in a row well for the sister for the wife for not angering her husband she has angered Allah and that is the wrong choice the Prophet said a day is awesome there is no obedience to a creature in this obeying the Creator so definitely she is sinful if she resisted in the beginning and gave in during she is sinful if she resists it from the beginning to the end and kept on fighting then her fast is valid and she has no expiration to be done now to substitute this is a luxury that we do not have in Islam either you fast the full 60 days or you're unable and your uh nobility is not judged by your own enzym whims and desires a Mufti should tell you yes you're unable so if you are chronically ill if you're too weak if you are unable to fast due to a legitimate reason related to health then yes you can feed 60 people but if you just simply feel bored or don't want to or you have lame excuses this doesn't work it you cannot fast like 50 days and feed 10 people it does work like this this is not the stock exchange market that you can pick and choose different portfolios nope you have to fast the 60 days and you have to do this believing and hoping that Allah will forgive you because what you have done is a serious offense and a serious sin so when we say you have to fast 60 days this is not accurate you have to fast two consecutive months so if I start fasting on the 15th of Muharram I finish on the 15th of Rabi al-awwal whether Muharram was 29 days or 30 it doesn't matter whether suffer was 29 days or 30 it doesn't matter two consecutive months began at 15 finish at 15 now if I missed and I fasted the whole period but on the 13th of rabbir I didn't fast for no legitimate reason what should I do it's very simple begin fasting two consecutive months see when we say consecutive mean that you do not break it except with the legitimate reason what do you mean she illegitimate reason well a woman is fasting two consecutive months she gets her period seven days she cannot fast today she saw her purity she took oasl tomorrow she must fast if she missed tomorrow she should start over from day one but if she fasted a month and got her menses for a week and eight days she fasts then this is number 31 one month and this is the first thirty first a person travels legitimately I work in a company they tell me to go one week to London it's a legitimate excuse full week I do not fast when I come back immediately I have to fast I started fasting month of del cada the full and then nine days of the ledger and then I had read in the three days of the shriek which is haraam for a resident too fast I have to break my fast read three days afterwards then what immediately on the 14th of the ledger I have to resume fasting so the month of the para nine days of the ledger 39 starting from 14 this is the 40th day onwards if I fall sick I can break my fast and continue after I recover well share what do you mean sick because I got a wound in my finger I've can I break my fast no re is this does not impact your fasting so like I have a knee pain doesn't impact your fasting I broke my leg doesn't impact your fasting something that does with your health so you have stomachache you have severe migraines that requires you take a lot of painkillers you have something that is making your fever high or your power law this is a legitimate reason you may break your fast once you recover immediately you have to follow continue and complete and Allah knows best what sallallahu wasallam Mubarak I don't know be in a Mohamed why the ADI he was happy he edged me you [Applause]"
