  "transcript": "sarah from ethiopia uh uh i have a specific question first i met one friend who who is an ex-muslim and i asked him the reason why he converted his religion and he said to me that he was living with his parent in saudi arabia and his father get executed because he changed his religion or converted it and i asked him for a proof and he really shocked me by showing me a hadith that was he burned some people because of them converting their religion and in fact it is sahih bukhari and i wasn't able to answer anything and i told him just to wait to just you know refer about the studies uh if there is anything that i can tell him about it and make a clarification for myself first of all sarah you have to be careful in what you ask in public because you may earn all the sins that misconceptions may cause in people's heads because of your question so you have to be careful in what you say in public is it going to benefit other muslims or not maybe you're genuinely asking to know but you don't know whether this would confuse others or not maybe you have a hidden agenda to cast doubts about islam indirectly pretending that it's an honest uh question this is in allah's hands nevertheless i will answer you number one the hadith of ali may allah be pleased with him burning people because they converted the religion is not true ali may allah be pleased with him fought with people who said to him that you are the creator of the heavens and the earth you are our our lord that we worship so they did not make him a prophet they did not make him a saint they did not make him a messenger they made him allah ta'ala he tried to advise them to call them back to islam they said no you are our god we worship you so he ordered them to be burnt his cousin ibn abbas may allah be pleased with them all said to him the prophet prohibited killing people by burning them because no one tortures with fire except allah almighty this is the torment of allah but he had already executed them by doing this to make them an example to others so that they won't do such a heinous blasphemous act so it was not changing the religion number two the issue of execution in islam is not to be dealt with individually this is not a jungle where the survival of the fittest when i see something wrong i change it with my hand if someone changes his religion i kill him if someone fornicates and he's married i stone him to death i will be a murderer this is not to me to do this is only to be carried out by the muslim ruler who has a panel of judges to give their verdict and he carries out this verdict so it's a system it's a sharia not for individuals but for the head of state so if there is no head state if you're living in europe for example can the muslim community execute such prescribed punishments the answer is no this is not to them even if they have a leader even if they have an imam this is something only to be carried out by the head of the state the head of the country thirdly according to sharia law the prophet alaihis allah said whoever changes his religion then his prescribed punishment is to be executed again by whom by tom dick or harry no it's only by the head of state and if there is no head of state he's none of my business i don't care whether he changes his religion or changes his gender this is up to him the the one to implement sharia is the head of state so whoever changes his religion from islam to another religion in a muslim country according to their laws and to their sharia and to the muslim court a panel of judges sit with him try to convey the message and how dangerous this is and what will happen to him if he does not revert back to islam the muslim ruler may execute him and this is his call and this is his decision so number four how is it possible for a muslim like yourself to take a friend who was an ex-muslim someone who curses your religion someone who's trying his level best to take you out of islam with him whether you are willing or not i don't know but i'm assuming that you're not that's why you're calling me how is it possible if this person slandered your father if she said by the way your father molested me your father raped me would you still be friend with her if she curses your mom and says your mom is a prostitute would you still be best friend with her if she tells everybody that you had an affair with her brother and she shows them the proofs which she made up would you still be friend with her of course not why because you honor yourself you have dignity but when it comes to your religion someone curses your lord or your quran or your prophet or your religion and you say i was shocked so i thought of asking this means that your islam and your iman is not certain you don't have certainty because if you had you'd have definitely said nope i don't believe in this if someone were to doubt you and say which orphanage did your parents take you from you said no i was born to my real parents how do you know did you do your dna test no so how do you know you were in there would you accept this and go and do your dna test or you will take it for granted that no this is ridiculous this is stupid i am the legitimate child of my parents how is it that you're not willing to put up a fight blindly defending your religion when someone like that casts doubt in it this shows that you are in great danger sarah may allah make things easy for you and for us you"
