  "transcript": "Ammar from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Yeah I had one question. Yes sir. I work for a company building a software. My company is trying to sell this software to a bank. I know that my company will sell this product to other enterprise customer as well later but currently they are focused to sell to this bank only. I want to know whether my income is halal working building the software for this company. As long as your company does not solely work for a conventional interest-based bank and they're building a software that is halal, an instrument, a tool that is halal that can be used by many other establishments and enterprises and companies, not necessarily banks or insurance companies, as long as this product is halal and it's general for all, there's no problem in your job over there."
