  "title": "Should a Traveler fast 9th Dhul Hijjah, I was told not to fast as a traveler",
  "transcript": "Abrar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, during Dhul Hijjah, I travelled for 19 hours and considered myself as Musafir. While travelling, I fasted due to the huge rewards during Dhul Hijjah that I couldn't miss. After reaching my destination, an alim told me what I did wasn't right and I shouldn't make voluntary fast while I'm a Musafir. So I skipped the 9th Dhul Hijjah, painfully, since he was a trusted man to me while anticipating reward from Allah Azza Wa Jal. As I really wanted to fast, did I make the right choice? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazaka. First of all, what your scholar said was totally baseless and not true, unfortunately. It is permissible for a person to fast while travelling, whether it's fard fast or voluntary fast, providing there is no hardship on him. If there is hardship, then it's highly recommended not to fast. If there is danger and harm, then it is prohibited for him to fast. So if you tell me I'm a youngster, I'm full of energy and power and I'm a young man and fasting is totally acceptable for me, there's no hardship, I'm not fatigued, I'm not tired, it doesn't bother me a bit, then you should have fasted and continued and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
