  "transcript": "hamza from bosnia what should one do when his family becomes negligent about islamic rulings no matter how much he tries to warn them but they don't care and not only that his family says that he should stop talking anything related to islam in front of them and they say keep your religion only for for yourself can you give some advice about this please dear sheikh i will do that inshallah brother hamza from bosnia he says that a person's family are ignorant and negligent and not only that whenever he tries to educate them and call them to islam and teach them the proper way of quran and the sunnah they say to him do not speak to us about islam what should one do you have one of two choices one choice is totally unacceptable illogical and islamic and that is to take drastic means to force them to torture them or to shoot them with a shotgun this is not logical you can take a horse to the river but you cannot force it to drink the other alternative or the other choice which is the logical one you have to change your strategy you tried to call them they said we don't want to listen please stop stop don't shove it down their throat don't force them if they don't want to if they're not interested leave them however change your strategy by behaving like a real muslim showing them your compassion and mercy coming to their aid whenever they need aid without any strings attached let them love you let them respect you let them see how islam changed you islam by the way is not only preaching i can sit here all day long and speak and preach and give fatwas this is good but this is not islam i have to walk the talk when i talk about charity i have to be the first one giving charity when i talk about helping others i have to be at the frontiers i have to be at the front line serving people and giving them whatever aid and assistance i can do so that they can point at me and say this guy is okay this guy is doing the right thing why ah it has to be his religion his religion is good i love islam but when i preach but i don't walk the talk when i'm stingy when i have the worst of manners which sometimes unfortunately i do then there is a deficiency in me and people would stay away from me because say sheikh is rude he's not good he's not dealing with us islamically so you have to change your strategy make a lot of dua in your sujud allah azza will open their heart it cannot be done overnight usually it can allah is capable of doing it but usually it would take a few months because what you had built over the past years cannot be erased from their memory all what they know about you that he's pushy he's so uh insisting on things he's so compelling he wants us to do these things immediately when we're not convinced for them to change their idea about you they would need probably like five six months and then you can start calling them with wisdom and fair preaching and allah knows best you"
