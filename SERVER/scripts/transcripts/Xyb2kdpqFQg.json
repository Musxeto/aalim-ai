  "title": "Hadith to give glad tidings of hell to kafirs when passing by their grave? Authentic or not?",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US. I read in a hadith the other day in which the Prophet ï·º ordered the Muslims to give the disbelievers the glad tidings of the hellfire whenever a Muslim is to pass by the grave of a disbeliever. Some scholars have come to the conclusion that this is a weaker hadith while other notable scholars like Sheikh Albani have authenticated it. I don't know which opinion I should be inclined towards so what I wanted to ask you was what is your take on this personally? Thank you. Jazak Allah Khairan. Jazakum. We are laymen. So laymen are ordered to follow a trusted scholar in the science they are laymen in, in whatever he says. Therefore, in fiqh, if you're a layman, you have to ask and follow a scholar you trust his moral conduct, his ethics, and his religious practice, and his knowledge. So whatever Sheikh Ibn Aithmin says, we follow him in fiqh or in aqeedah because we're laymen. We don't have the tools that enables us, that enable us to differentiate and distinguish what is right and what is wrong, what is weak and what is strong. In hadith, the same ruling applies. We are all laymen in hadith sciences. Therefore, when it comes to authentication of hadiths, we depend entirely on Sheikh Albani, whom we trust. May Allah have mercy on his soul. We know his knowledge. We know his sincerity. Therefore, we follow what he says. So if the Sheikh authenticated such a hadith, where the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam gave an advice and ordered his companion that whenever you may pass by the grave of a disbeliever, then give him the glad tithing of hellfire. And the companion complied and did this and said that was a bit hard for him because he used to do this all the time. This is an authentic hadith and we have no other way out than to believe and to implement this and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And by Allah's will, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
