  "transcript": "Yousef from the UK she my brother lives in London and the nearest mosque to him is about 40 minutes walk and 7 minutes by car it's about 2 miles so 3.3 km so he finds it difficult to go every day to the mid is is it for him to pray home 2.2 kilom are usually done in like 15 to 17 minutes what do you mean by 40 minutes walk sorry sorry two miles so 3.3 kilometers okay yes in this case yes he's Exempted from praying in the Masjid and he doesn't have to drive but I would personally advise those who live in cfer country to do whatever is possible to be engaged with the community and to be with the congregation even if it requires them to drive these few minutes by car because your heart needs maintenance and maintenance of your heart cannot be attained praying your five prayers in home the quality of the prayers are jeopardized and the timing and sometimes you will skip prayers without noticing it because you follow the steps of shatan yes it's not mandatory don't get me wrong but I'm saying that those who live live in a cafir country you have to work harder than others and Allah Knows Best"
