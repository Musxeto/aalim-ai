  "transcript": "Yasin from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh, I wanted to ask you like how many Iraqis came and prayed on Qiyamul Layl? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazak. This is an issue of dispute among scholars where they limited some of them, the night prayer or Qiyamul Layl to 11 raka'ah as per the hadith of Mother Aisha in Sahihul Imam Muslim that the Prophet ﷺ did not pray night prayer whether in Ramadan or outside Ramadan more than 11 raka'ahs. However, this hadith was challenged by other hadiths reported by Mother Aisha, by Ibn Abbas, by other companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, where they say that the Prophet ﷺ used to pray 13 raka'ahs. And also it was challenged by the hadith where a nomad interrupted the khutbah, the speech, the oration of the Prophet ﷺ one day asking him, O Prophet of Allah, how do I pray night prayer? So the man is asking and the Prophet ﷺ answered him without giving him any limitation of the number by saying night prayer is two by two, which means that the sky is the limit. You have to pray them two by two, not four by four or six by six, rather two, offer salam, then two, offer salam, then two, offer salam, and the sky is the limit. And if you fear the break of dawn, then offer one raka'ah of witr so that it would conclude your night prayer as the Prophet ﷺ said. Therefore, the challenge is valid and limiting night prayer to 11 raka'ah is not the most authentic opinion, rather it is an opinion. However, if a person feels that by praying 11 raka'ahs and focusing upon the quality and the length and the beauty of them to stay on the footsteps of the Prophet ﷺ, then he's highly rewarded. And if a person feels that prolonging his night prayer by increasing the number of raka'ahs that gives him more tranquility and more peace of mind, also this is highly rewarded and Allah knows best. You're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
