  "transcript": "say it from india says i've heard that in one of the videos saying that making dua after fall prayer is an innovation this is not an accurate statement unfortunately many times people hear things and they understand what they want to understand and what sticks in their minds is what they want to understand i always pray far in the masjid alhamdulillah one day after fart i was going to buy a car and i remembered after finishing the fart so i raised my hands praised allah offered salutation upon the prophet salam and made oh allah make me successful in my endeavor is this a bidder no the bidder is to maintain regularly making dua after your 4th prayer or after your sunnah prayer so every single fart like we see the vast majority of our brothers from the subcontinent and from egypt and from syria and from all over the world almost after for prayer some of them do this i don't know maybe it's a fly some of them wipe their face and bodies i don't know why but they do it they saw someone doing it and it looked hip it looked cool so they're doing it did the prophet do this hassan no no no no we have never heard anything of like that did the companions do it did they ever into it did they tell you everything into it they all say no so why are you guys doing it well there's no harm in doing it come on guys you are innovating in the religion doing this after every prayer is an innovation now say i'm asking you you said if i pray alone and i raise my hands and make dua if you do it once in a blue moon no problem but between you and me nobody's listening inshallah why do you want to do dua after fault prayer simple answer straight question simple answer sir i want allah to respond good answer does allah respond most after finishing the prayer when it's all over or during sujud in the prayer itself or before concluding the prayer with salaam alaikum definitely in sujud and after salutation before the salam to conclude the salah this is what the prophet said allah again between you and me this is private nobody is listening inshallah do you think that the pride that the prophet saws would advise you of doing something which is less which is not answered by allah azzawajal only a heretic or a lunatic would say such a thing definitely the prophet would advise you the best advice so logically if you're a man of intellect if you want allah azza to answer your dua make it in sujud in salah or make it before salam in salah now if you insist he said no no no no no i'm going to do it after salah and i'm going to raise my hands it's going to be every prayer why would i care do whatever you want i can lead a horse to water the horse would walk behind me for 10 miles without complaining when we get to the water if i get 10 men to help me and assist me to make and force the horse to drink it won't drink you're not a horse so inshaallah allah will guide your heart"
