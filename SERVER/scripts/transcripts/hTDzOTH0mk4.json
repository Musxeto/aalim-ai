  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. A 55 year old woman wishes to visit her husband's grave from a very close distance. It's been three years since he passed away and she never ever visited his graveyard, but now she wants to visit his grave with her adult son as mahram. She also wants to bring her teenage daughter if permitted. So are they allowed to make this visit at least once in their life? JazakAllah. Wa Jazakum. First of all, visiting graveyards is a recommended sunnah for male, for men. As for women, it's an issue of dispute. Scholars differed whether it's permissible or not. I'm inclined to follow the opinion that says that this is totally prohibited and not permissible. And this is the opinion of Sheikh Ibn Baz, Ibn Uthaymeen, and other great scholars of our time. So I'm inclined to say that no, she should not do that. Rather, she should do what's more beneficial, which is making dua, giving charity on his behalf, making umrah, or making hajj, and Allah knows best. you"
