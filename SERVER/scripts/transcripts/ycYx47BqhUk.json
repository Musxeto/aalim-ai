  "transcript": "Brother Hamza from Bosnia has a governor Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. How can I help you today? Sheikh I know that driving my family member to a haram place or specifically to do haram activities is participating in sins and it is not permissible. My question is what's the ruling on telling them that we could only take them back home after they finish their haram activity? Is that also helping in sin? BarakAllahu Fikum BarakAllahu Fikum. See the issue revolves around the understanding of the verse of the Quran in Chapter 5 Surah Al-Ma'idah where Allah says Wa ta'awanu ala al-birri wa al-taqwa wa la ta'awanu ala al-ithmi wa al-udwan So collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon oppression and vice, sins, haram. Any type of collaboration or assistance for them to do haram, you would take part in that. So taking them to a place where they will commit and do haram is sinful for you regardless how small or big that sin is. Now if you say to them I'm not going to take you but once you want to come back home I'll drive you, it would also assist them in doing the sin partially. So yes maybe they can go with friends but they may not find someone to bring them back. When you volunteer and tell them I'll bring you back because this is not assisting on the sin rather I'm bringing you back home, that would also be part of the assistance and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
