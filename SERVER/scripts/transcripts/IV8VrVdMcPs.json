  "transcript": "Ubaid from Tunisia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you doing Sheikh? Alhamdulillah What are the things that oblige us to make isti'adah again while reading the Quran? For example if I talk to someone or I eat or I read each ayah then the tafseer of that ayah which might take a while before reading the next ayah. BarakAllah Wafikum. Wafikum BarakAllah. First of all seeking refuge in Allah from shaytan saying A'udhu Billahi Al-Sami' Al-'Alimi Minash Shaytanir Rajim is a sunnah and it's not mandatory. So if you say it in the beginning while reciting the Quran and you interrupt it with something that is not from the Quran such as worldly matters speaking to a friend, a spouse, a relative, answering the phone, before you continue to read the Quran you are highly recommended to seek refuge in Allah from shaytan again. It doesn't take you more than a second or two. To me if you're reciting a verse of the Quran and you go to tafseer to find the meaning of it and you continue reading the Quran you don't have to say A'udhu Billahi Al-Sami' Al-Alimi Minash Shaytanir Rajim again because this is connected to your recitation and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
