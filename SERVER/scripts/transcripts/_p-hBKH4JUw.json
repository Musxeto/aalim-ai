  "transcript": "zaim from India I saw this regarding the luxury like it is the Servants of verily or something there are words I don't like that but it is like the Servants of Allah do not like luxury so what is luxury I want explanation and apart from my discussion I want to bring something into your view that is there is a channel on YouTube can I name it um we have only one question at a time zahim so maybe next time inshallah luxury if I understood your question luxury if the Hadith translates in my head that Allah they are not among those who live a luxurious life in the sense that all what they do revolves around materialistic things so a servant of Allah is permitted to eat good food is permitted to seek drinks that are sweet and fine to wear good clothes to write a good car or a good ride to live in a good house this is not a luxurious life when does it become luxurious when my life revolves around these issues and I would resent life if I don't have these things so to have the world in your hand is okay because you can spend it and you can get it to have the world in your heart is not okay because extracting it from it would give you a heart attack is it haram to enjoy good food and drinks no the prophet Islam used to send people to get Sweet Water from Wells that are two days journey because the water of Medina was a bit salty so he used to love to drink water from a particular well two days journey and the companions would go and fetch it for him just to get closer to Allah by pleasing him and the prophet used to love water used to love to eat the meat of a shoulder of a ram and this is the place that he liked meat from the most he used to drink water mixed with some honey so it would make it sweet all of this is halal and it's not luxury luxury is when you can't drive except exotic cars and if you drive in a Hyundai nowadays Hyundai is is probably a luxurious car if you drive some of them Chinese cars you would think that whoops I'm not looking at others because I feel degraded and this is not my standard oh now this is a luxurious life living your life enjoying what's in it in halal earning and Halal expenditure is permissible and Allah Knows Best foreign"
