  "transcript": "brother Yusuf is facing a dilemma with his wife now he says may allah azzawajal grant his wife the hijab of ohm silane and I would say I mean and he says that his wife loves during Ramadan to watch movies TV series listens to listens to music etc and he doesn't know what to do he there is a big problem among or between the spouses the couple when one of them all of a sudden starts to be practicing this problem would not have appeared most likely if before you got married you selected a spouse or a wife to be in the same or better than you in your religious practice so if I were to get married I will not choose a belly dancer I would not choose someone who does immodest things I would have been laughs because I am investing I'm gonna choose someone who is going to be an excellent mother for my children I would know how she would bring them how what what is her mentality how what is she driven by but usually when people are young fresh graduates they're interested in a woman for her beauty so they get married not focusing on religious practice because I'm not religious I'm not committed so I'd like someone to be like me so after a while when attending lectures listening to good words watching a YouTube video on Islamic teachings Allah guides me to practicing Islam so I love what I hear and see I read the Quran I get more knowledge I'm getting stronger in Islam focusing on myself and neglecting my wife at the end of the day the gap is widening so now when she and I used to love to sit on the couch watch a movie I don't watch movies anymore it's all nudity violence music and lies after lies but my wife is still hooked on it so there is a big drift between us and all of a sudden we get a caller saying cher we have a problem and I don't know what to do with my wife now the easiest way out can be summarized in divorce but this is not logical destroying your house your family over things that she disagrees with you over and you just call it a quit no this is running away from battle what to do Cher you have to focus on saving her from Hell so that she would be with you in Jannah if allah subhanaw taala wills it and you both enter general how to do that try to start from scratch try to have her get closer to religion a little bit better than before she may not reach your level overnight it may take a month three months six months but you have to be patient and you can't just flood her with everything so quit music quit movies wear the hijab wear the niqab don't talk to anybody close your social media accounts might as well tell her to drop herself or throw herself in the ocean while she doesn't know how to swim she's gonna drown so you have to be wise weigh the consequences prioritize the things that to be addressed and give unconditionally with full conviction and love and respect and show her mercy don't speak to her from your ivory tower and saying that I know you don't know you're ignorant you're an imbecile you don't have any knowledge I know nobody accepts this so uh it takes a lot of effort and the gain and reward is priceless but you have to put some effort into it you have to walk the talk you have to give her a quality time it's not enough for you to grow a long beard and shorten your soap and pray the message it and then you do the whole nine yards of sins of disrespect of abused of this cheating and lying this doesn't work you have to be a role model and make a lot of Dura in your suit try to give her an alternative environment with good companionships so lots of good women who are wise and well educated to mix with her to try and give her Dawa because sometimes she may listen to them not to you and then insha'Allah Allah will make a difference Manila"
