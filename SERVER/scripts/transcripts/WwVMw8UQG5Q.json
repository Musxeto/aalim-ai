  "transcript": "is from Pakistan alayum uh I was saying that I teach a student and the contract is that I teach him for one month and he pays me 250 R uh but the thing is that uh recently the he told me himself that if I if you teach me like from this date till March I'll give you 250 which is not even a month and then happened this till when the date came he didn't even take so many classes like he missed so many classes due to some reasons so in the end very less classes but then I told him look you said 250 R but then had a whole debate at the end we brought it down to uh 125 I told him no do 150 he's doing 150 so is this permissible because it was his fault or like it depends on the agreement a Muslims agree verbally and when they're confirmed they're Bound by their agreement so if he said to you teach me until March and you fulfilled your contract uh uh obligation your contractual obligations were fulfilled there's no mistakes from your side you taught him till the time that was agreed if he missed classes and the agreement was not per x amount of classes rather per time to the end of March or the beginning of March and you fulfilled that he is obliged to give you the the amount of money if he's refusing and you can't take him to the police and you can't do anything and he pressures you to go down to 150 or whatever and you agree alhamdulillah"
