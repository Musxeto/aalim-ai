  "title": "MoonSighting Confusion, Follow Saudi Arabia or Locals Mosque? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Rayan from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh So I have a question regarding the moon sighting on Ramadan because I know there's a lot of confusion between countries saying that some should follow Saudi Arabia. Moon sighting, the most authentic opinion is that it is region related and this is the hadith in Sahih Muslim where Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, after a whole month of detecting the moon in where the caliphate is and that is in Syria, he said that we follow our own moon sighting and you guys in the caliphates follow your own moon sighting which means that it is region related and he attributed this to the sunnah. So the sunnah is that you guys follow your own moon sighting. Now some folks say that we in Britain could not do this because the vast majority of cases there are clouds that hinders our sighting of the moon and due to the amount of factions and difference of opinion among different sects, cults and masjids and Islamic centres, it is difficult to unite the Muslims. So some scholars say that because of this situation, in order to preserve the unity and due to the actual difficulty of sighting the moon and this is not a one shot in a month that this is throughout the whole year due to clouds and difficulties of detecting and sighting the moon, some would say that yes, follow Saudi Arabia and I personally believe that if the religious authorities in the UK, the majority of them say that yes, we will follow Saudi Arabia in that, that would be fine inshallah and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
