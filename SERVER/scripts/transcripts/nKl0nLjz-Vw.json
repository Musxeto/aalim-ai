  "transcript": "Our first caller is Suham from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So if a rapper or a celebrity is in a collaboration with a brand and they make shoes together, but if the rapper like broke up with the brand, can I buy the shoes that was made in collaboration? Basically speaking, the issue of buying a brand, whether it has the name of a rapper or a singer or an actor or an actress or any other thing, the issue is, what am I buying? If it's a shoe, if it's a bag, if it's something that can be used, what's the ruling on buying such a shoe or a bag and using it? Now, is it haram to buy a shoe that has the name of an actor or an openly sinner person? Because this is what concerns Muslims. A rapper, an actor or an actress or the likes, these are people of sin. They do sins, they go against Islam and they are famous because of their sin. So when you buy the shoe, most likely you're not buying it because it is something that is good or of an excellent quality or that it can make you run faster or it's more comfortable. Rather, you're buying it for the name. So I'm wearing my Jordans. We all know what Jordans are. So you're buying it because it has the name Jordan. If another Chinese company manufactures something more comfortable, more practical, but without the name Jordan or without the brand Nike, it's a Chongqing. Nobody would buy it, even if it's half the price or 10% of the price. So the ruling, technically, it's halal whether the rapper is still in collaboration with the brand or not. But is it advisable? The answer is no. It is not advisable. It's not haram. But why would you associate yourself as a Muslim with such an open sinner? As if you're endorsing his name or his music or the haram that he presents. Maybe this is something we should think about."
