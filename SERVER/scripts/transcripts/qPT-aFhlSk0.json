  "title": "Should we love Ahlul Baytt just as we love the Prophet ï·º",
  "transcript": "from canada he says we know that we have to love the prophet islam more than we love ourselves our parents our children and everything but does this also cascade to a little bait to his wives the mother of the believers to his children to his offspring the answer is no this has no relation to that our love is to the prophet more than anything else do we love the mothers of the believers of course they are our mothers do we love his offspring definitely because he commanded us and he advised us to do so but this does not elevate to the love of the prophet and we're not supposed to love them or sacrifice our lives to them as we do with him alaihis that's a different a total different issue and matter all together you"
