  "transcript": "Sheikh, before the break we promised to get to the subject of how the Prophet, peace be upon him, dealt with the pre-existing beliefs and habits of the new Muslims around him. Did he change their names? Did he encourage that to be changed? How did he manage this process? Well, the Prophet, alayhis salatu wassalam, did not use the same method with all. So it is dependent. There are so many Muslims who accepted Islam and the Prophet did not change their names, alayhis salatu wassalam. And the vast majority of them, their names remained as they were. However, there are people when they accepted Islam, the Prophet, alayhis salatu wassalam, changed their names. Either because their names were inappropriate or it had a bad meaning. We addressed this in one of our earlier episodes. With the children. Yes. Naming the children. So it is not the norm for someone's name as David, for example, to come and call himself Abdullah. Why is that? He said, I'd like to change my name. You don't have to. David is a good name. Michael is a good name. John is a good name. It's just a name. But if it's something that is the servant of Jesus, no, this is not permissible. If it is the name of their gods, for example, Rama or whatever, this is to be changed. If it is someone's name, which is insulting, his name is Moron, for example, you change this. But other than that, you don't have to. If you wish, it's okay, but it's not a must. See these misconceptions, Muslims have them. Superstitions. Muslims have them. Not only new Muslims. So what and how to deal with this? The best remedy for ignorance is by far knowledge."
