  "transcript": "uh Nohan from Bangladesh so my \nquestion is about these Hadith can you like briefly explain this Hadith and \naccording to this hadith if I use a perfume   which is which has a bright color or which \nwhich doesn't have a very heavy scent would it   be considered as imitating woman - this is a Hadith \nat the moment I'm not sure whether it was said by   the prophet (Peace and Blessings Upon Him) or by \none of the companions but it's a very well known   Hadith I have to recheck it and it translates \nto the perfume of of men is what has a scent   and has no color and the perfume or adornment of \nwomen is what has color but does not have a scent   now this is regarding what a man or a woman \nMay wear in front one of one another even   if they were non mahram providing it is not \nvisible so a men can wear any type of perfume   as long as it has a scent strong weak it doesn't \nmatter you can wear any type of perfume but you're   not you are not allowed to wear anything that has \na color so you're not allowed to wear  makeup   you're not allowed to put glitter on your body or \nwhere Henna in Hindi on your body other than the   recommended or a permitted area such as the hair \nand your beard for the henna so this is for men   as for women a woman cannot go out wearing \nperfume because this is totally prohibited   and the Prophet ﷺ  made that a major sin and \none of the reasons to prevent a woman a woman from going into a Masjid if she's scented and wearing a \nperfume where men can find the scent and the smell   of it but she can Adorn herself with makeup \nuh lipstick whatever providing Non Mahram are   incapable of seeing that due to her \nwearing the hijab and Allah knows Best"
