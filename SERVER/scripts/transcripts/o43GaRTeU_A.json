  "transcript": "And learn the jurisprudence that is easy to do, by the Shari'ah, without being enraged by so-and-so. Our good tidings are more than lies, for knowledge is like the flowers in the garden. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah and his family and companions and those who follow his guidance. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. My name is Asim Al-Hakeem and I would be having the honor of teaching you the subjects of Fiqh in this first semester of Zad Academy. And in this semester, we hope to tackle the essentials of Tahara, which is purity, the types of impurities, the types of waters that would be needed to perform your purity, the type of vessels that we can use such waters with, what breaks your wudu, your ablution, what is ablution required for, how to perform ghusl to uplift a major ritual impurity, how to purify your garments or your body or the places you're praying in from impurities, how to purify a person, a woman, when she is out of her menses, and also the etiquettes of wiping on your socks or your shoes, the etiquettes of performing wudu, the ghusl, answering the call of nature, how to purify yourself with water or with solid objects such as toilet paper. We will be talking about prayers, about Adhan, about Iqamah, about how to offer the prayers, what are these prayers, what are the voluntary prayers, the description of the Prophet's prayer, the pillars, the mandatory acts, the Sunnah, the not recommended, the makrooh acts of Salat. We will be talking about the things that nullify your prayers and so many many things, all packed and jammed in this semester. So I hope that you will be able to benefit to learn your religion and to cement your Islam so that may Allah Azawajal make you and I among those who are steadfast on their religion, those who know their religion and those who are able to propagate and spread the word of Islam. Al Fatiha."
