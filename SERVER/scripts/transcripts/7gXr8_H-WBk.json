  "transcript": "the next question is what is the ruling on homeopathic medicine because I'm confused on whether it is halal or not some homeopathic doctors even claim that allopathic medicines contain alcohol and other impure substances can you please advise herbal medicine has been used since the beginning of time we believe in herbal medicine which is experimental it's from nature and scientists and doctors and generally speaking say it's good now homopathic what is it homeopathic homeopathic I usually call it uh medicine that is greatly found in the subcontinent they use a lot of alcohol in it some of it is 70% 80% alcohol and of course when have alcohol in such substances how will you feel oh great very good so definitely it's going to work this is by default but it is not permissible to use medication that contains alcohol openly like this because it causes people to go intoxicated so if this kind of medicine does not have alcohol and it does not have Haram ingredients it's fine as long as it's experimented and it's natural and it does not have any negative side effects it's Hal whether it's coming from the Hindus or it's coming from the sik or it's coming from XY Z no problem we have no problem in terms of the healing process if it is proven to be medically safe and correct and there's nothing Haram in it but if it has a huge or big amount of alcohol that would intoxicate you if consumed in large quantities no this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
