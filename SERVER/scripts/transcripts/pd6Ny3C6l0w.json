  "transcript": "[Questioner] from France social uh recently I'm \nworking in a place where we are using some alerts   in the before that I was working in a place so \nI left that and I have tried my best to find a   Halal job so this is a car fabrication company and \nthere is no alcohol or food something like that   but the problem is whenever we work there are \nsome alarms Melody sounds that we are using   like when we have a problem in the post or we \nwe are not capable of doing a part of the job   so we are using a special pattern and an alarm \nturns on in a loud speaker and our responsible   or boss he or she may hear it and come and ask \nus about the problem that was the problem and   there are some two three or four types or maybe \nmore alarms different alarms for different groups   so and we are hearing it and some of the times \nwe are obliged to use it ourselves when we need   help so are we sinful for that or does it make \nour salary Halal okay I got your question so   basically speaking the answer is no your salary \nis halal because your job description is halal and   you are forced to hear such Melodies and musical \ninstruments which is not for the sake of enjoyment   rather for the sake of alarming others to come \nand attend so it's like a bell some houses have   when you press the button you hear an orchestra \nplaying uh Beethoven V and you don't want this   they've installed it you don't want to hear it \nor listen to it sometimes you call a company   and they put you on hold and you hear music \nagain you don't want to listen to it there's   a difference between hearing something which is \nunwillingly or and listening to something which   is done willingly and enjoying it so there's no \nproblem in your job and in these alarms that you   may have to apply or listen to because this is not \nmusic that you are enjoying or listening uh to you [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford \nit that's good for you if you cannot you're   entitled for one free session and this is for \neverybody if they can affirm by Allah that they   cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give \nthem one free session without a problem a full   half an hour so come to me and let's speak \nabout it inshallah within the following two   days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for Allah thank you"
