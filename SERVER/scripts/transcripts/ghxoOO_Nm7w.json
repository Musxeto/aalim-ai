  "title": "Doing Ruqyah only once a day effective? If I do it after Salah, is it ok? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ibrahim from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh I had a question I was watching a Q&A from yours before and you mentioned a good point around Ruqya. Some people they do it maybe once a day so I wanted to do Ruqya more often because I do it only like once a day. I wanted to know if I can do it after my Salat just because it's a convenient time and I wanted to know if this is like Bid'ah or anything like that. As long as you do the Ruqya after a Fard prayer due to its convenience though with all due respect I beg to differ. You have 24 hours in the day and you don't find any time of convenience except after Salat that is a bit dodgy but Subhanallah. If you do it without believing that doing it after Salat is more rewarding or more beneficial then there's no problem in that. What I said was an out of experience that people who do Ruqya once a day is not sufficient, is not beneficial as when it is repeated throughout the day like 5, 10, 15, 20 times Allah knows how much because it's a form of Dua. The more you do it the more likely it is to be answered and to be effective with the grace of Allah and Allah knows best."
