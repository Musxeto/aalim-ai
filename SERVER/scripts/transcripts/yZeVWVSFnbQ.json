  "transcript": "relationship is built when an adult is drinking from the woman and moreover how can a man a drink from a breastfeed from who is not makharam as we know that is a principle uh is there anything like such as that she pour milk on her cup and drink it as though some sweaters say he's terrified inshallah labe is asking about an issue known as suckling an adult and this is an issue of dispute there is only one single hadith where salim the freed slave of abu hudaife that is and when he was freed he was a little child so he grew up in the house of his previous master and when he reached the age of puberty he was like their son coming in and out of the house but then now he's a grown-up man his wife complained to the prophet isaiah that abu hudaisha is not at ease when he comes home that is salim when he comes home and sees me in my home attire not wearing the abaya not wearing the full hijab because i'm home so what to do the prophet instructed her to suckle him so she said oh prophet of allah he's a grown-up man he's got a beard he said i know sucker him milk and he will become your son now this hadith is authentic no doubt in that how to understand it without going into technicalities is what we should do what do you mean by going into technicalities how is he gonna suckle is he gonna touch her uh directly and she's a nun mahram to him before suckling or is he going to put some milk in a cup and he drinks a cup and this would be considered one suckling and he has to do this five times how many times this is something we don't have information of but definitely it's not what some of our filthy minds may jump to conclusion definitely but how this is none of our business at the moment yet we have the good intention to think well of the companions secondly did anybody apply this concept other than them the answer is no with the exception of mother aisha so mother aisha used to take this hadith and whenever she wanted to unveil herself among men she used to order her nieces to do the same thing to offer the milk to that person and he would become mahram to her because she would be his grandma but all the other wives of the prophet salaam totally prohibited this and did not approve of this all the companions of the prophet hassam did not approve of this why because they all understood that this was a specific incident only for salim that's it it's not to be cascaded to anyone else and this is what the vast majority of all scholars of islam have concluded now if there is an exception by one or two scholars who thought that they have room to maneuver like mother aisha did this is their ishtihad but it is not at all compelling or permissible to go for derishtihad and leave all the others who have compelling evidences to prohibit this and to only accept this as an isolated incident for salim is best"
