  "transcript": "Yusuf from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Salam wa Rahmatullah. I've been getting this doubt lately that if like I'm doing a good deed or a mandatory thing or I don't think if someone looks at me and makes fun of Islam because of it, I have like taken myself out of the out of the fold of Islam. So what should I tell myself? I don't know what to do in this situation. You should tell yourself that this is totally stupid. With all due respect Danny. You don't leave the fold of Islam just because of random thought. If you go to your Christian neighbor and give him a paper and you say, excuse me Mr. Stewart. Good morning. He said, good morning neighbor. He said, would you please read this paper? He says, okay. Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wa ashhadu an muhammadan rasool Allah. Here you go. Has he become a Muslim? You'd say, no. Why? Because he just read a paper. He did not have conviction or belief. Exactly my point. So when you get a random thought that if you do this, if you do that, you become a kafir, you become a mushrik, you leave the fold of Islam. Who cares? It's a thought. It's shaitans whispering to your ears. You have not done anything that takes you out of the fold of Islam. You did not have any conviction of leaving the fold of Islam. So totally ignore this stupid thought and don't be messed around by shaitan like this. And Allah azza wa jal knows best."
