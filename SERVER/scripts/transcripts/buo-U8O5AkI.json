  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I'm confused about my name. I looked up the origins and meaning and found that it generally means son of the Fair One, but if you really break it down Mack means son of and Kenzie is derived from the name Kenneth which means handsome or born of fire. So this means our meanings are also associated so I think there might be some problems because it was originally used for men and that Mack means son of but I'm a female and I don't know if it makes a difference but nowadays especially where I live the name is common among females also since the name can be can mean born of fire I feel like this could be problematic because jinn are created from fire not humans. The phrase born of fire might be metaphorical for something related to passion or strength but I'm not certain at all about that so do I have to change my name? The answer is no there is no need at all to change your name."
