  "title": "Can we add something extra to the Salam like “wa maghfiratuhu”? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says is it allowed either for one who gives salam or for the one who replies to the salam to extend more than assalamu alaikum for example etc now there's nothing that beats the sunnah and the sunnah as far as we know came only with the limited number of words and allah azzawajal told us in the quran to reply either similar or better so when we say assalamu alaikum you can reply by and this is similar if you want to go a bit further you can say but if they go the whole nine yards and they say assalamu alaikum you should say and reply by saying full stop there isn't anything from the sunnah that is authentic to say however if a person adds to the salaam not thinking that this is better than the sunnah or that he's doing something better than what the prophet taught the sassam is a simple gesture of dua because when someone says no this is not part of the salaam but it's a form of greeting so adding something similar to that like etc not thinking that this is from the sunnah nor thinking that i am completing something that is missing there is nothing wrong in that insha allah and allah azza knows best"
