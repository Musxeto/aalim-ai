  "transcript": "We have brother Ammar from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, I just wanted to ask about a hadith. It was narrated that once the Prophet ﷺ was resting in the house of Mother Aisha ra, and Abu Bakr ra came and the cloth on the Prophet's leg was uncovered and he didn't do anything. But then Uthman ra came and he immediately covered his leg. So Mother Aisha inquired about this and the Prophet said that why should I not feel shy from the one whom angels feel shy from? So I just wanted to ask, what did the Prophet ﷺ mean by this? The angels feel shy from him? The hadith that Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, was among the most bashful of all the companions, and this was a characteristic in him, that he was shy from things that would bring bad reputation to his name. From things that were immodest, more than anyone else. To the extent that it was reported in his biography that he never touched his private part at all with his right hand, since he gave the Pledge of Allegiance to the Prophet ﷺ because he shook his hands with the Prophet ﷺ. Though it is permissible to touch one's private part with the right hands, but the prohibition is when urinating or when cleaning yourself after answering the call of nature to use your right. But other than that, it's permissible. It was also reported that he never took a shower nude, that he always had a piece of cloth covering himself when he took a shower or a bath because of his bashfulness. Now, having said that, this is not something that would deter him from enforcing what is righteous and virtuous, and forbidding what is evil and vice, because he was the third Khalifa, and you cannot run a country by saying, oh I'm bashful, I can't order this or that. No, he was determined in so many things, and he was decisive in so many things, and this had nothing to do with his modesty and bashfulness. And the hadith shows us that whomever deals and treats with Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, in a fashion, in a way, that we deal with him out of respect in the same fashion. So those who fear Allah Azza wa Jal, we fear them. We give them the amount of respect that is equivalent to their fear of Allah. Those who are generous for the sake of Allah, when we deal with them, we're generous with them. Why? Why do you treat him better than XYZ? Well, he's generous in giving charity, so might as well I be generous with him whenever I deal with him. This is what the Prophet's message was, alayhis salaam, and also to highlight the importance of being bashful and modest at all time, and Allah knows best."
