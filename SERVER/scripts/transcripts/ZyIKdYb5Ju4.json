  "transcript": "so every time i keep on reminding you didn't i give you this shame didn't i give you my card six years ago so that you can take a wife to a hospital and now you're doing this to me he keeps on until you are on your dying bed said well if i had i would have given you but insha'allah the minute i get something i'll give it to you and i'm willing to do whatever you want you're in need of the money but because i've given you a good word and i've given you a nice way to meet you this is much better than giving you the money and saying listen be careful bring it on time and five minutes after you leave by calling on mobile how are somebody doing remember the time the clock is ticking you have one year minus five minutes and every six six six or seven days i keep on calling don't give me your money give me a good word beat me with a a smiling face rather than give me the money and uh uh insult me day and night by your uh rhetoric the prophet says that islam so i'm emphasizing the importance of having good character he says and bad category spoils these i've done so many things for you i was with you to meet your need i did this i fed you when you were hungry i forgave you the debts that i uh lent you i think this and that prophet says beware because bad character or conduct spoils deeds as vinegar spoil honey bring honey and put vinegar on it taste it even even that imagining it you know it sends the the shield down your spine look this is exactly what happened to your good deeds and so many times well i've heard this and you've heard this of course so many times you see people not only harming strangers but even their loved ones so many times i've heard complaints of husbands going to their wives and saying i did this for you i did that for you what did you do in return nothing your ungrateful woman and women complain say we cannot say this because allah would put us in hell this is but what about the man when he's doing this to his wife they keep on putting salt on injuries so that it may harm them more and more you find people talking to their loved ones who had done them favors where i did this to you i did that to you and brag about it everywhere this spoils good deeds and i pray to allah azzawajal that we have benefited from this great hadith of the prophet and that we become part of those whom the prophet isam had uh described for us and that allah almighty grants us his blessing and favor to excel with our character conduct and moral ethics and allah knows best"
