  "title": "Lips peeling (dead skin) create barrier in wudu? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Saad from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam. Most of the times when my lips get wet, a layer comes out which is maybe a mix of dead skin cells or it is maybe something like this. It is very soft and can be peeled by just touching it as if it was something external. So is my Wudu valid? Yes, your Wudu is valid Inshallah and don't preoccupy yourself with such thoughts."
