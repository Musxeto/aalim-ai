  "transcript": "Fuad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Allahumma Yahfadukum Sheikh And you as well, what can I do for you? So Sheikh, is it permissible to set the Adhan as an alarm? BarakAllah Feek This is a trend nowadays with lots of smartphones that they set the ringtone as an Adhan, recitation of sudais, some duas, and all of these are not permissible. The Adhan is made to announce the time of the prayer and not to be used as a ringtone and so is the Qur'an. The Qur'an is to be listened and pondered upon and implemented, not to be used as a ringtone and as this would be disrespecting it and Allah knows best."
