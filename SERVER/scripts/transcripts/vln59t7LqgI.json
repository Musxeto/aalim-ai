  "title": "Should I do Umrah or give money to the poor? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Tanzeel from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, how are you? Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I have a question regarding performing Umrah. Suppose a person performing Umrah every year during the month of Ramadan for 15 days. He stayed at the Kaaba and performing prayers there. So which one would be the more beneficial, performing Umrah or donating the same money to the poor? Of course performing Umrah. This concept of donating money to the poor deprives us from doing a lot of good deeds for ourselves. And this is where Shaytan comes. Now, I'm not saying that you should not help the poor, but I will use the same methodology. You drive a Mercedes Benz. So which is best, to continue to drive the Mercedes Benz or to sell it and buy a Chinese cheap car secondhand and donate the money for the poor? You will not do that, will you? Oh no Sheikh, how can I sell my Mercedes? How can I sell my house and live in a small apartment? How can I sell all of my clothes and have only one pair of clothes or suits? This is the same concept. The more you can do to get closer to Allah, whether through Umrah, through Hajj, through doing righteous deeds, you should focus on that. And if there is anything extra, we will give to the poor, not the other way around and Allah knows best."
