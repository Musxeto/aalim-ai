  "transcript": "Faheem from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, if I miss Duha prayer and I came to know after Duha or maybe after, can I make it up? The answer is no. Duha prayer is bound to a time. If the time of Dhuhr is due, you cannot make it up afterwards. You can offer voluntary prayers but this is not to be made up after Dhuhr. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
