  "title": "They have pictures of me without Hijab, ask them to destroy? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Maham from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Maham Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Speak up My question is that back when I didn't do hijab, I used to be part of family pictures with my aunts and uncles and I don't know now which relative of mine has a photo of me, but there is a possibility that they may have the picture, so what should I do? Should I ask them to check? First of all, Alhamdulillah that Allah has guided you to hijab, and this is a blessing from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Secondly, it is acceptable for you to go and speak to your relatives and tell them, listen I have taken up hijab and you know that you may have pictures of me when I wasn't wearing it, so I would kindly request you to destroy all of them or to send them over for me to destroy them, and that is all what you can do. Sometimes people are so evil, when they see you approach them and ask them such a question, they would circulate your picture more and more. While if you pick up hijab and do not say anything about it, they would probably ignore these pictures and not pay any attention to it. So this is up to your judgment to look at your family relatives and evaluate what type of people they are, and then take the necessary measures that Allah knows best."
