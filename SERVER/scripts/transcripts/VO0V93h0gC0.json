  "transcript": "uh yaman from bangladesh my question to you is this that it is regarding what that we do in our daily life so there are various methods like we take showers we use buckets from which we take the water out of it and uh impart every day so uh when we do but using buckets there uh there is a thing that uh when we pour down the water onto our body the water sprinkles and spreads onto everywhere around the bathroom and it even it falls into the container or the bucket uh okay got your question i will answer inshallah and from bangladesh he says when we are performing russell from a bucket of water most of the times when we pour water on our bodies a lot of the water deflects and falls back into the bucket does this impact the purity of the water the answer is no the water is still pure and the water used in washing your limbs is still pure there is no apparent najasa there is no feces or urine that you are washing off and it's going back to the bucket you are performing russell which is a ritual ritual impurity not something that is physical it's a ritual thing so there is nothing wrong in what goes back to your water unless najasa is 100 percent falling into it and changing the characteristics of the water"
