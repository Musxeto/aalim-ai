  "title": "Do we say Ameen loudly or silently in Qunoot? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "and i would have expected you not to specify a name after the salaam because in the hadith of abdullah may allah be pleased with him that the prophet salallahu told us that among the signs of the day of judgment uh uh uh the signs of yom qiyamah that people would give salaam privately so they would come to a congregation and would address the person assalamu alaikum especially those listening to you but this is not our problem what's your question for it  my question is if we perform the witcher prayer with the congregation then when the imam resets the dua will be say amen in loudly or you should say it in a voice that you can hear but the shouting that we hear in the haram and in other masjids and people say ah me and the whole masjid is shaking this is not part of the sun now you just say ami and that's it and allah knows best you"
