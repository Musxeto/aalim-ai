  "transcript": "Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. How are you Sheikh and how was your Eid? Alhamdulillah it was beautiful. JazakAllah Khair for asking. My question is Is there anything Hadith or anything that is backing up saying that when we pray alone at home or something That angels pray behind us. This is my question. No, there is nothing to my knowledge that confirms the fact or the Thought the idea that when we pray Alone at home angels pray behind us and take us as in a name The only Hadith I know of is when a person Stands to pray in the middle of the night and offer his tahajjud The Sunnah is to use the miswak and to brush your teeth So that you would clean your mouth because once you stand to pray an angel is Standing in front of you placing his mouth in front of your mouth. So whatever you recite would go into him Honoring the Quran So this is the only Hadith I know of and Allah knows best"
