  "transcript": "So, I just want to ask, frankly, most of people attend here, most of them all young men, right? And one of the truths that I found about young men is mistakes. Yes, mistakes. And a lot of young men is making mistakes, right? And one of the mistakes is quality of Ibadah. My question is, can you share about your journey on how you maintain your quality of Ibadah and how you face your future? Okay, there is a long version and a short version. So the short version is I don't speak about myself. So, please forgive me, I don't speak about myself at all. Ask me something, I will answer you. But don't ask me how this, how did you do that, tell me about your past. Because if I kill you, if I tell you, I have to kill you. Okay?"
