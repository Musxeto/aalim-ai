  "transcript": "[Music] like the guardian is usually the father but uh i'm doing like a research and for that they require like the consent of kids below 18 years of age in that case also do i require their father's consent form or like the mothers because i usually contact the mothers of the kids to do what research research on what on the medical conditions this is a legal thing namira it's not an islamic thing islamically if one of the parents or even a brother gives the con consent and there's nothing harmful for the child but you're just researching you're not experimenting you're not taking them to the lab or dealing with them like guinea pigs it's an experiment there's nothing wrong in that but it's a legal thing so if legally you obtain the mother's consent and the father can challenge you in court no you're not supposed to do this you have to follow the law but if legally they say no this is nothing in this case there's no problem in it islamically inshallah you"
