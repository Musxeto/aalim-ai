  "title": "What age should a child read  Quran and begin to pray? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so amanda's question is at what age a child should read the quran and start to pray as for reading the quran it can start from age one age year one year two there's no limit for that many children begin to speak by teaching them the basics of the quran and they learn it from a very very early age so there is no minimal age for that as for prayer the prophet salallahu salaam ordered us to command our children to to pray when they're seven years of age and to spank them for not praying when they're 10 years of age so the three years between 7 and 10 these years are used to frequently order them to pray but without punishment or reprimanding so five times a day 360 days a year for three years for 4 000 plus times we're telling him come and pray go and pray did you pray without reprimanding without shouting without screaming at them and this would definitely work with any stubborn child after three years when they're 10 years of age they're definitely have this prayer in their system if after 10 they're reluctant and not praying on time we can spank them and reprimand them can we order the children to pray before seven the answer is no you should not order them if they want by their own selves to pray and you direct them you guide them you teach them there's no problem in that but you shouldn't force them or tell them to pray before seven because this is the age that the prophet said had said sallallahu you"
