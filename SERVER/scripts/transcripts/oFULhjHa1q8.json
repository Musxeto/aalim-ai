  "title": "Take a shower first (get wet, apply soap, etc) or do Ghusl first? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Sri Lanka. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam to Allah. Sheikh when doing ghusl I first wet myself then I apply soap everywhere and then I wet, I wash, I bathe again so is my ghusl valid? First of all I highly recommend those who are performing ghusl to either perform ghusl in the beginning full ghusl so it's valid then they apply soap and shampoo and clean themselves afterwards or to apply shampoo and soap and clean themselves and then perform a full ghusl so that they wouldn't mix apple with oranges and then have this confusion and Allah knows best."
