  "transcript": "Ismail from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh my question is if for example if someone reads a prayer or he does any act of worship for the sake of Allah he does not for example for example the love or the hope of Allah for example he forgets he forgets you know like after act of worship like oh I did not have the love or hope of Allah while doing the act of worship or hope in Jannah so what should he do should he repeat the act of worship again no no no no no this these are whispers of shaitan nobody can be 100 percent attentive and focused this is impossible and only angels can have this in the hadith in sahih al imam muslim when handala al usdi may Allah be pleased with him met abu bakr and he's different than uh handala ghaseel al malaika ibn amir he said how are you handala and he said I have committed hypocrisy he said audhubillah why he says when we're with the prophet and we're listening to him we're looking at him we are in a very high level of iman but the moment we go back to our farms and our wives and children and we mix with the business we don't recognize our own hearts we feel different abu bakr said whoa I have the same feeling houston we have a problem let's go to the prophet so they all go to the prophet and handala repeats his dilemma and the prophet says to him handala by Allah if you were in your farm in your business with your wives and children like you are with me when you're mixing with me and listening to my preaching in that case your level of iman would qualify you to see the angels descending in broad daylight and shaking hands with you because your iman would have been complete and this is not possible however an hour here and an hour there meaning you can't maintain the same level of supremacy in your iman but nevertheless an hour dedicated to Allah to his worship and an hour dedicated to what you are inevitably in need for that is to work to gain money to mix with the wife and the children to have quality time with them so this is what is needed and once you maintain this balance then you're in good hands that's why when we pray sometimes we are not that mindful of okay I'm doing this because I fear Allah and I feel his wrath and I'm doing this because I want Allah's pleasure and I want Allah's jannah sometimes it doesn't work like this I'm not that mindful so there's no problem in that because iman fluctuate goes up and goes down and Allah knows best"
