  "transcript": "Yes, I understand. Okay, finally, tonight, I am in a different set. I am an English teacher from Haji Nur Khan School in Malang. What I want to ask is, would you please give us, and also some parents, how to motivate and also how to give that one to our teenagers. Because as you know, teenagers are really unstable human beings right now, and they do a lot of bad behaviours, and in school we have constant divergence, and also a friend is more important for them, rather than their parents. I think that's it. Thank you. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. And my name is Emma. My name is Emma. Thank you. Okay, first of all, I totally disagree with the comment you made that the teenagers are unstable. If you look in the seerah of the Prophet, Alayhis salatu Wassalam, what was the age that the Prophet would allow people to come and fight in wars? Fifteen. So when you come and say, no, no, we have teenagers here. We don't have the terminology in Islam of teenagers. We do not have teenagers. We have adults and non-adults. In Islam, the moment you hit puberty, you're an adult. You're accountable. Usamah ibn Zayd was seventeen, some say eighteen years old, when the Prophet appointed him, Alayhis salatu Wassalam, as the ruler and ameer of an army. Who was in this army under his leadership? Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. Oof. Under Usamah ibn Zayd? Usamah ibn Zayd was black. So even the Arabs would say, how is this possible? No. This is management. If you look at Ibn Umar, Abdullah ibn Umar, he was fifteen when he was admitted to fight in the Battle of Uhud. And the Prophet used to scan and screen the companions. How old are you? Fourteen. Go back. Fifteen? Come. So, I believe that the teenagers need trust, need support, need us to believe in them. Why do we always deal with them with doubt? What are you watching? Show me your mobile. What is in your bag? Why did you come late? Who are you talking to? Why do we treat them? Okay, don't they do bad things? Yes. But excuse me, parents, don't you do bad things? So, it is the same concept, number one. Number two, when we fail to give our children quality time, they will run. When your child, of course, we don't have children, but I'm talking out of experience. When your child is five, six, seven, eight, until maybe ten years of age, he's running after you. Abba, I want to sit with you. I want to talk to you. Let's go and play. But you don't have time. I have work. I have da'wah. I have this. I have that. When he reaches fifteen, sixteen, you run after him. Come, let's sit. No, no, no, I have friends. I have football. I have to go there. I have to go there. Now you come and cry. Why is he not sitting with me? You refused to sit with him in the beginning. Had you given him quality time from the beginning, he would have been with you all the way. So, it's not rights and wrongs, do's and don'ts. It's a full package. Once you bring up the children to be adhering to Qur'an and Sunnah, you will never have these problems, inshallah, and Allah knows best."
