  "title": "Husband paid her zakat for years, some missedâ€”what to do now",
  "transcript": "Ijaz from Kashmir. Ijaz. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, please bear with me. It's a bit longer question. No, no, no, no, no, no. You can't ask a long question. Ask the question. If I need details, I will ask you. Okay. Okay. If a couple did not have proper understanding of zakah payments on gold jewelry and the woman initially relied on her husband during the first few hours years after marriage and they did not have a clear idea about the correct categories of zakah intention to be made by the owner etc. and husband kept paying. If she can't recall which rules were followed and whether some years were missed, is repentance sufficient or repayment has to be made? How would I know Ijaz? This is something that she's held accountable by. Either her husband was paying it every year or he wasn't. If he was paying it every year, why is she doubtful? This is whispers of shaitan. If her husband defaulted and did not pay it for a number of years and she knows that and she did not do anything about it then, then she has to estimate and give the zakat of these years that she estimates that she skipped and give it at this time."
