  "transcript": "so Yousef is asking at times of pandemic when we are all praying home should we make a van when we want to pray the answer is it is accepted and permissible is it mandatory the answer is no because you live in Algiers and it's a Muslim country and the messages there call a Dan so there are then would suffice for you if you are in a kafir country and there is there are no messages calling the event or if you're in the desert then you should do that but while in a Muslim country while in a country where there are messages that had already called Adan this is not mandatory for you plus and this is a bonus for free a karma is highly recommended whether for men or for women but it is not mandatory so if I just go Allahu Akbar the prayer is valid but it is highly recommended to call for the Akama before praying even if you are praying alone"
