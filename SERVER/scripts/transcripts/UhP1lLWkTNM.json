  "title": "Can we compete in sports for trophies or play with those who don't cover their Awrah?",
  "transcript": "We have Abdel Nasser from Spain. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Yeah, I have two questions. One only. The first is about sports. I used to play in a football team and I heard that it's haram to play competitions where you like earn trophies or something like that and that you can't play if you are playing with people that doesn't cover his aura. And the other question is thatâ€¦ One question only, Abdel Nasser. Only one question. So in response to your first question, playing sports and competing in it is halal, providing that you do not gamble. And part of gambling is when a team pays an entry fee and the winner takes all or takes everything. So while competing, you are risking losing all or gaining much more than what you had input. It's like insurance. It's like buying a lottery ticket. You lose one euro but you may gain a hundred thousand euros if you win. But if you don't, you lose one euro. It's okay. No, this is gambling. If you're competing and the club is not paying entry fee and the club is giving you salary, there's no problem in that. If the prizes are given from the sponsors or from a third party that is not participating, there is no problem in that. As for the aura, we've stated before that it's an issue of dispute whether the thigh is aura or not. The most authentic opinion is that it is aura. However, the vast majority of footballers nowadays wear their shorts and underneath them they wear a sort of leggings that covers the thighs to the knees. And if this is the case, inshaAllah, this is permissible and Allah knows best."
