  "transcript": "consider subscribing um abu bakr from cyprus uh i recently watched a video of yours saying that um for women we should cover the lower parts of our next so um if should i remind every woman i see about it and if i'm praying in a congregation with other women do i have to also is my prayer valid if the one that's leading it is has their neck uncovered not doing the ruling on it okay so let us get things first of all straight what's the ruling on a woman praying while exposing other parts of her body other than the face and the hands the vast majority of muslims they say that this is totally prohibited because she's ordered to cover everything in her body with the exception of face and the hands and there is an issue of dispute in regards of the feet but it is a weak opinion so even the feet have to be covered now if a woman exposes her neck and i've seen this with some westerners and they especially riverts who come to islam and some of them want to tailor islam to their liking so instead of covering like muslims they just simply wear a head scarf that covers their hair with their necks with part of their chests exposed and they call themselves hijabi no you're not hijabi who are you fooling in the quran to lower your garments and to cover your bosoms and whatever comes underneath your face and some scholars say no you have to cover also your face and this is the most authentic opinion even though even those who say you don't have to cover your face they all agree that you have to cover your full body including the neck and your earlobes and your the back of your neck and what is this and we've see we see this among celebrities who call themselves muslims in the west and they have nothing related to islam unfortunately maybe they have muslim names muslim heritage but they do not relate to islam they support lgbtq rights and they have to have these rights and they have they have all the rights to do their filth and to practice it and to marry the the same gender they have these rights and what about islam and quran so no no if islam in quran says otherwise i don't believe in it okay say it loudly so that people would identify you as an apostate or a non-muslim rather than saying no no i am muslim and i advocate muslim and people attack me because i'm muslim the islamophobe is everywhere and then you come with these bombshells and you throw them on islam and muslims destroying and trying to destroy everything that islam calls for you're not a muslim a real muslim so take a second look at your belief and come up front be sincere to everybody don't beat round the bush don't use islam now when we come to the issue of covering during prayer this is prayer it's not my thing or your thing this is governed by the quran and sunnah if a woman prays while exposing her neck and part of her uh chest and she's leading prayer and she knows this her prayer is invalid and those praying behind her their prayer is invalid as well is it my responsibility to tell every woman with diplomacy with a kind preaching and knowledge yes if you see them sister this what you're doing is wrong your prayer would be invalid here is the fatwa alhamdulillah islam q info the most famous islamic website in the world the most visited islamic website in the world this website has authentic and reliable fatwas just get a print out and put it in the masjid and circulate it around the women and allah knows best you"
