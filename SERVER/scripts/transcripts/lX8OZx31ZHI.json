  "transcript": "on the other side of the coin the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did not deal in such a way with his close companions who had knowledge in an incident Abu alari may Allah be pleased with him one of the first to embrace and accept Islam had a dispute and an argument with Bilal the Aban Bashi the MU of the prophet and both of them are High Caliber companions yet Abu seemed to have lost it and in a fit of rage he sort of called His companion Bal by a racist comment and he said you are the son of a black woman of course he's a son of a black woman he's black he's a binan his father is black so what's the big deal he's black he's white he's yellow he's red this is how Allah created us what's the point Abu did not say this out of good gesture or out of a compliment or out of of saying a statement rather he said it in a racist fashion to degrade Bal B did not reply he could have reciprocated he could have said something hurtful but he did not he went to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and complained to him the prophet summoned Abu when Abu came having this at the back of his mind that I am one of the few who accepted Islam in the very early stages so I should have seniority I have I should have some form of status the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam rebuked him and admonished him and said have you said to him you are the son of a black woman you are a man of ignorance now being someone of an old age respected and being labeled as a man of ignorance was probably hurtful so he said oh prophet of Allah after all this uh these years and I I'm still considered the man of ignorance I said yes by saying what you had said to to your brother you are a man of ignorance and the prophet gave him advice Abu straight went straight to Bilal not to blame him why did you complain about me to the prophet Alam couldn't we have solved this between us aren't we Brothers he did not say any of this he did not blame B rather he went and lied on the sand putting his cheek on the ground saying to B come and put your foot on my other cheek oh you the son of a black woman meaning that I am even lower than what I had said to you and I deserve only to be insulted and humiliated in such a fashion Bal did not take even and he said may Allah forgive you my brother stand up stand up I'm I'm not going to do such a thing"
