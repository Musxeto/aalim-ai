  "transcript": "Another sister asks, I am a groom's mother and I want to know if my son can take gifts from his in-laws at the time of the wedding which they give with their own wish. Is it okay to take or we should not take at all? What is prohibited in Islam is to ask for dowry from the girl's family. This is a Hindu practice. Muslim men don't do this. Real men don't do this. It's the man who's the guardian, who's the financial source of the marriage. Allah Azza Wa Jal says in ayah 34, chapter 4, surah An-Nisa, Ar-rijalu qawwamuna ala an-nisa. Men are guardians and protectors of women for two reasons. Because Allah favoured them over women and because they spend from their own wealth to provide for their women folk. So real men don't ask for dowry. But at the same time the Prophet ï·º used to accept gifts. And these gifts are unconditional. They're a token of goodwill. It's an expression of love and a good relationship. So if this gift is realistic, someone gives the groom a watch, a pen, a wallet, something, a set of perfumes, these are normal. There's no problem in that. But in Arabia it is the tradition and the customs that the guests, the uncles, the cousins, the friends, would put some money in an envelope and tuck it in the groom's hand as a gift. This is not a dowry and it's not from the in-laws, it's from everyone else. So this is permissible. But if the father of the bride gives his son-in-law a car or buys him a house or furnishes the whole house, no, this is a dowry without any doubt. A man should not accept this and says, uncle, if you want to give me something like that, please register it in my wife's name. May Allah forbid something happens in the future, it's hers, not in my name. And this is a gift for his daughter. That's okay. So many parents give their daughters on their wedding night or before that a kitchen for her or a bedroom or a living room for her. It's in her name. It belongs to her. Everybody knows this. This is not a dowry and it's a gift and there is no problem in that, inshallah."
