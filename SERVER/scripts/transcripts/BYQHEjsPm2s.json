  "title": "Can we Be Seen with Non-Hijabi Women in Public, As it May Be a Tough Pill for Them to Swallow?",
  "transcript": "from the us so i know in general it's haram to go out with family members who don't wear proper islamic clothing but what are the principles in respect to this let's say someone has family members who aren't practicing at all and feel like this would be a tough pill for them to swallow and also feels like this would help them be a bit more comfortable around them and it would be easier for them to give them dialogue at the end of the day i'm accountable for my actions i don't care about how people feel and whether they can swallow it uh well or not i follow my religion if i'm a hijabi if i'm a kaabi and my cause or my sis or relatives of mine want to go out wearing nothing virtually not hijab not covering their hair wearing perfumes i would be endorsing their sins and i would be tarnishing the reputation of hijabis exactly like when you see a hijabi or an akabi in a talent show or a concert attending a concert or listening to music or watching a movie these people are damaging the image of islam they say no no we're a hijabi you know you're not a hijabi if you're attending such filth and such uh uh sinful places so don't care about what people say or think or believe or the impact of your action upon them think about what pleases allah you"
