  "title": "If I imagine the prostitue who gave water to the dog, am I sinful for such imagination",
  "transcript": "Aftahi from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Did I pronounce your name right? Yes, what can I do for you? When I hear a hadith or story regarding a matter of Islam, if those include something related to a woman, then an imagination of woman or the woman doing the specific thing comes in my mind. For example, the bad woman went to Jannah by giving water to a dog. When I hear this, the woman giving water to the dog comes in my mind. So am I sinful for such imagination? No, there is no sin in that, inshaAllah, none whatsoever."
