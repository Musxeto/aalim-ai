  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum There is an elder in my family who often listens to horoscope. I try not to listen. I try to advise them, but they don't agree with me. They said they like it. They want to hear it. I change my rules, but I still hear murmurs. Are my prayers valid? What did they do, Akhi? They listen to horoscopes. They do what? Horoscope. The prediction of future. I know horoscope. What do they do? They read it? They send it to you? No, they watch it on TV. Okay, what does this have to do with you? I think I read a hadith in which says that if you listen to it... Okay, are you listening to it? I'm not intentionally listening to it. As long as you're not listening to it, then there's no sin on you. The moment they start to say, oh, I'm a scorpion. And it says that tomorrow or next week, this and this and this is going to happen to me. Here is where you have to stop them. And if they don't stop, you leave them. And you have to remind them every single time. Believing in such nonsense takes you out of the fold of Islam. If you believe this nonsense, you are not a Muslim anymore. You've committed an act of apostasy. If you don't believe, but you just read it for the fun of it, then 40 days of your prayers are invalid. You, my friend, on the other hand, you have nothing to do with this because you've stopped them and you're not approving of it. And you left when they did not stop. So, alhamdulillah, your prayer is intact. Al-Fatiha."
