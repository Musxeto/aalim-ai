  "transcript": "from bangladesh he says that i missed uh saying the dua yesterday last night and tonight so can i say the dua of uh uh the new crescent it's an issue of dispute whether this dua is authentic or not and i personally think and believe that it is not authentic i might be wrong because this is from my mind my memory maybe is not uh doing well but i believe that it is the most authentic opinion is that the dua is not authentic and it requires that you see the crescent if you don't see it then there's no point of making such a dual"
