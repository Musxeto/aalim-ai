  "title": "Is it permissible to use poppy seeds in our foods? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it permissible to use poppy seeds in our food now if you go back and research it you'll find that poppy seed itself is not intoxicant though once it is planted and it grows and and the fruit of it they get from it opium and it can be chemically processed to produce heroin and other drugs so the scholars say poppy seeds itself the seed itself is not intoxicant people can consume it and use it in their food without any problem and we always put the disclaimer in that is if consumed in large quantities would result in intoxication hallucination or some of such effects in this case it becomes Haram but due to the fact that people have been using it and they do not consider it to affect them negatively with the grace of Allah in this case it is permissible to be used"
