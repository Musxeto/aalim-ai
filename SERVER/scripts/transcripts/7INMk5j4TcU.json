  "title": "Should Muslims take flu & Covid-19 vaccine with all the conspiracy theories going on? AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "hamza from the u.s says we have a problem now with the flu vaccine and the possible corona vaccine which will be forced upon us in the u.s uh once they get it approved so islamically what's the ruling on taking it because there are some particles that are non-halal first of all whether it's halal or not this is for the scholars to talk about and the scholars have already discussed the issue of glycerin and gelatin found in some medications and we've covered this issue topic long ago a number of times and we said that the material which is haram has been transformed totally into a halal material so likewise when we irrigate an apple tree with sewer water and then we grow up an apple we take the apple we eat the apple we smell the apple it's legit it's an apple so is it nudges because it was irrigated with sewer water or is it no it's halal it's totally legit because the sewer water has been transformed into something halal the blood and the food and the things we eat and consume when they are trans formed into milk in the mother's breasts or in the cow's breasts i don't know if they call it breast or what excuse me so the milk is milk halal though it came from the blood and the intestines and said and all this filth inside yet now the end product is halal likewise with the vaccines whether it's going to be enforced or not to my knowledge is not enforced in the states it's not mandatory to have it it's totally against their democracy so yo you are not forced to have it the flu vaccine has been there for ten ten tens of years and nobody was forced to take it so you have the right to say i'm not gonna take it now whether it is okay to take it or not this is not for me to say and i'm not one of those who follow the conspiracy theory and we would say that there is a chip that will control your mind or will control your dna etc this is all bogus and it requires a doctor a physician a muslim trustworthy physician to come and say it's good for you to take it or it you're better off without it or it's 50 50. and and this is something i don't have the knowledge to uh say it would i would would i take it personally no this is for personal reasons not because i doubt it but simply because i believe that allah has created everything for us alhamdulillah and we don't see the need for it as an epidemic or a pandemic but in some countries they there might be a need and this all depends on a trust a trusted panel of muslim scholars who are physicians who have knowledge and who can help us in this matter and elijah knows best"
