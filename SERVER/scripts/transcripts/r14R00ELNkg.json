  "transcript": "Elisa from Belgium Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh I have a problem with my OCD and my waswasa. They are causing me a lot of hardship and it's already been two months now and I don't know what to do because I feel like it's increasing a little every day and sometimes it calms down but then I have this feeling that it comes back much more and it's waswasa and about almost everything not only in prayer and in wudu. So, what to do? I advise you to go to my website and book a counselling session if you can afford it. If you cannot afford it, we will give you one single free session inshaAllah for those who fulfill the conditions of being poor and unable to pay for it. We need to sit and talk lots and lots and lots of those who have whispers. They have a problem in how to weigh things, how to evaluate things. It's not rocket science. It's just simply the need for someone, an outsider, to open your eyes to make you see things clearer. And this we do on daily basis, alhamdulillah, on counselling sessions and it will go away with the grace of Allah azza wa jal."
