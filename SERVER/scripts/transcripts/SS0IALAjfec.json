  "transcript": "The next question is, is it allowed to wed a woman committed zina which resulted in pregnancy? Is it allowed to do what? To wed a woman. To? To marry her. To marry. Who made the zina? The woman. I know. Who made the zina with her? It takes two to tango. She didn't do it alone on another planet, ya Sheikh. Huh? She must have done it. And is the man asking, is the culprit her partner or someone else? Oh, mashallah. So many people know the woman. I am not very good in social media, so apparently I have to learn. OK. No, it's not. And the marriage is invalid. Definitely. The majority of scholars say if a man fornicates with a woman and they get married, whether she's pregnant or not, the marriage is invalid. The contract. Because she's not chaste and we cannot say that she is pregnant or not pregnant. We don't know if she is pregnant. The vast majority say from him is invalid. And this is something that to be looked into case by case. But this is what the vast majority of scholars say. Now, for someone else who is doubtfully a real man to come and marry someone whom he knows she's pregnant from another man. What is this? I might as well marry a public toilet. It's like reusable condoms. You don't have those. What are you doing? This is totally insane for a Muslim to do. So the marriage is definitely invalid."
