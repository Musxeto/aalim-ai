  "title": "Siblings are Trying to Distribute Land for Inheritance by Drawing Lots, or Flipping a Coin to Decide",
  "transcript": "i think we have akbar and he's our last caller inshallah from india yes can we use random kits to distribute things to people for example there are five pieces of land to be inherited by and distributed among five brothers can we use kids to allocate the pieces of land to them so that there is no display as the states are totally random can you can you use what paper writing names on the paper and mixing it and picking it up why do they have the same value no no that value is not same but to pick the random two names for if one land is on the roadside and we all all of them will dispute too no no no no no no no this is totally not permissible inheritance is a right so you have to share the same value if we have five plots and we're five brothers one plot is a million and the other one is half a million it is unfair to throw chips and select or draw the lots to know which one of us would get which from that one if i get the one with the 500 000 i feel deprived and unfortunate why would i accept such a thing the only way of doing it is to evaluate the value sell it and divide the money or we know that this is 1 million and this is 500 okay the one who's going to get the 1 million must compensate the rest financially say okay i'll give you 200 200 000 200 whatever if they agree to that then this is okay other than that no if there's no agreement they have to sell and take the money in cash equally not by drawing the lots or flipping a coin and then at the end of the day the loser is not going to feel good about it even if he gave his approval because this is taking people's wealth unlawfully and without their consent this is all the time we have you"
