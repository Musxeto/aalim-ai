  "title": "Is it sinful or rewardable to pursue Islamic knowledge instead of using my Biology degree",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from Lebanon I will graduate inshallah soon from my master's degree in biology however I decided that I don't want to continue working in this field because I want to spend more time uh seeking knowledge and because there is a lot of Haram in this field am I sinful or am I losing because this job might be first of all no one doubts that pursuing Islamic knowledge and learning Islamic Sciences is the best thing a person could do generally speaking so if you have the financial means to pursue your goal without jeopardizing your life and the life of those who you provide for whom you are accountable for such as your wife and children so be it but if pursuing Islamic knowledge in such a fashion and not working as a teacher or as a lecturer or in the field that you have studied would cause hardship for you and for those who you are responsible for then you are sinful as for the part of your major being a communal obligation alhamdulillah there are so many people who are doing that so you're not obliged to do it but you have to look at the shortterm and the long-term consequences of such a decision on your life and Allah Knows Best"
