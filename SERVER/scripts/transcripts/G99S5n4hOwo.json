  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh. Sheikh my question is if a layman wants to \ngain mandatory knowledge, but he delays in   starting it and after starting he doesn't gain \nknowledge consistently due to procrastination,   laziness or any other problem and in the meantime \nhe does something sinful or something which takes   a person out of Islam due to ignorance. \nSo is he sinful for this or out of Islam?   That is a big difference between is he sinful or \nout of the fold of Islam? Doesn't make any sense,   your question is illogical. Now this is \nthe biggest problem among Muslims nowadays   and this is the thin line, a very fine thread \nthat separates them from giving Takfir to people   and this is why we get [ ] and a Al Qaeda and \nextremist who just simply find it easy to, oh   he's out of the fold of Islam. He said so-and-so \nhe's out of the fold of Islam. That's very easy,   it's very common because they don't have \nknowledge. See one of the characteristics   or the signs of not having knowledge, \nknowledge when you say is this sinful or kufr?   Why would it be this ambiguous to you? Now a \nperson who does not seek mandatory knowledge,   we know that there is mandatory knowledge which \nyour Islam cannot be complete without and there is   auxiliary, complimentary, something extra. \nSo when it comes to for example Hajj,   are you going to perform Hajj this year? \nHe says no, it's not mandatory to know now.   Do you pray five times a day? Yes, you have \nto know this is mandatory knowledge. Aqeedah,   do you know the six pillars of Eman? No, this is \nmandatory knowledge, you have to acknowledge them.   Do you know the questions you'll be asking \nyour grave? This is mandatory knowledge,   you have to know them. So such knowledge, \nif you are delaying it out of laziness   and you don't learn it, are you sinful? Are \nyou out of the fold of Islam? Of course not.   Until you nullify your Islam, but you don't \nhave the knowledge, your Islam is intact,   you know Allah Azza Al Jal, you don't commit \nanything that nullifies your Islam, you are sinful   for not knowing what's mandatory upon you. I don't \nknow when to make sujud as sahu, prostration of   forgetfulness before Salam, after Salam, what are \nthe things to perform it for? Okay, go and learn.   My videos on YouTube are very clear and it's \nfree. Go ahead and learn it, watch it, it's   going to take you a couple of minutes. Nah, I'd \nrather watch wrestling or watch a cricket match.   Okay, then you're sinful because when you \nmake a mistake and you don't know what to do,   here you are sinful. But does it take you \nout of the fold of Islam? Of course not."
