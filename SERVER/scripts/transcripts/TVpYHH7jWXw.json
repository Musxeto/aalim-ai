  "transcript": "Sadia from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah. During my period I see complete dryness on 5th or 6th day. Then again on 7th or 8th day I see brown discharge. Then on 10th day I see white discharge. So should I pray on 5th day or 10th day? Is this always happening to you that the blood stops on the 5th day? Okay and on the 6th and 7th day do you see your purity? No brown discharge. No, if you see the brown discharge connected to the stoppage and end of the flowing of the blood, this is part of your menses. You have to wait until the brown discharge is stopped and you see the sign of purity and then you may take your ghusl and pray."
