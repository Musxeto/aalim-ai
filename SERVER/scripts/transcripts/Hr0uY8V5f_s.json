  "transcript": "Maaz from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, I basically had this question on behalf of someone else. So basically, backbiting, it's a common thing, you know, in our culture. And this person, because he had the habit of talking negative things when other people weren't present, he feels he might have backbitten the vast majority of people he met in his life. He obviously does not remember what he said, but obviously because he had this habit, he feels there would be a lot of people or perhaps even the majority of people, you know, he's backbitten. So in this case, should he ask forgiveness from everyone he meets, just in case, and be careful of not backbiting and unnecessarily gossiping about other people in the future? The answer is no. As long as there is no certainty, then he's not obliged to go and ask forgiveness from anyone. If someone says, I may and I may not, I don't remember, just for the benefit of the doubt, no, this doesn't count. If you're certain that you've backbitten someone or stole his money and you know that for certain, then you have to rectify such a sin. But a doubt, just because you were used to, doesn't count and you have to ignore it."
