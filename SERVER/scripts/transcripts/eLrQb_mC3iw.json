  "transcript": "Allah is taking the promise of time, oath of time. Verily man is in a state of loss. Man is in except those who have faith. Those who have righteous deed, those who invite people to truth, Allah is talking about dawa. inviting the non-Muslims to Islam except those who invite people to patience and perseverance. So these are the minimum four criteria for any human guru Jenna. You may be a very good Muslim. You may be praying five times a day. You may be fasting in the month of Ramadan. You may be giving zakat. You may have gone through Hajj. But if you don't do dawa under normal circumstances, you shall not go to Jenna. Only dawa is also not sufficient. All four are equally important. Righteous deed inviting people to patient and pursue. If anyone is missing under normal circumstances, you shall not go to Jenna. If Allah wants to forgive you and put you in Jenna, that's Allah's prerogative. But according to surah al assur under normal circumstances if you do not do any of these one of these four things you shall not enter Jenna and da'wah is fur conveying the message of Islam to the non-Muslims is fur for every Muslim Allah says in the Quran in surah alan chapter number three verse number 110 Allah says Oh ye Muslims, ye are the best of peoples evolved for mankind. Allah is giving us Muslims and honor. And Allah is calling us a um the best of peoples. Whenever there is honor, it is always followed up with a responsibility. There is no honor without responsibility. For example, in a company, the CEO, the chief executive officer has got more honor than a manager. The manager has got more honor than a clerk. In the same way, the CEO, the chief executive officer has got more responsibility than a manager. The manager has got more responsibility than a clerk. There is no honor without responsibility. Allah subhanana wa ta'ala in this verse of the Quran of surah Imran 3 verse number 110 is calling us Muslim asmah is giving us an honor. Don't you think we have a responsibility? The answer is given in the same versah continues because we enjoying what is good and we forbid what is wrong and we believe in Allah. Allah is calling us the best of peoples because we enjoy what is good and we forbid what is wrong and we believe in Allah. If we do not enjoy what is good and if we do not forbid what is wrong, we aren't fit to be called as hram. We aren't fit to be called as Muslims. It is the duty of every Muslim that he conveys the message of Islam to the non-Muslim. Our beloved prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it's mentioned hadith it's a say hadith ofi had number 2517 once a man comes to the prophet and asks him that should I tie my camel and then trust in god or leave my camel and then trust in god the prophet said tie your camel and trust in god what do you mean by trust in god trust in god means we do salah we worship Allah subhana wa t'ala what does Allah what did the prophet mean by saying tie tie your camel means you have to plan when we do anything if you don't plan that means we are not tying a camel if you plan means you're tying your camel if you fail to plan you plan to fail"
