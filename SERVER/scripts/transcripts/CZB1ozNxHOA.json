  "title": "What to do when Kufr & Shirk is discussed in School & it may influence others",
  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I asked the last time and you said it's not clear. So I rephrase it and You know in school they I said they teach filth It's better to say they talk about filth. So for example, they talk about shirk. They talk about About kufr it most of the time they don't order the students Okay, and you have an oral grade. So a grade which it's very important. It's it's had it has a much weight and It's about how well you participate in the talk now The thing is in some subjects like everything like in every lesson there's some element of philosophy and the like and and some Something which may move people to say something bad and in class they sit people who come from Muslim countries and They don't wear hijab. So and Based on what they say, they may be murtad. They may be not practicing. I don't know I don't investigate and now the thing is if they talk about if they have such a discussion like for example The discussion about whether whether you believe someone has a soul Must I really keep completely silent or can I just say? Okay, I believe I have a soul and then the teacher and I am not the teacher will say Okay, that's what he believes and all of you have the right to say whatever they want. I hope it's now clear The answer is the same Akhi. You live in a kafir country You don't like what you hear You don't like what you see Leave the kafir country and go to a Muslim country. You can't do that Do homeschooling you can't do that Sit in your class try your level best to weigh the pros and cons of your conduct and Whether there is benefit of it or it would bring more harm to you or to Islam Be diplomatic be wise know when to speak and know when to shut up but you can't Force Sharia down their throats if you know that everybody is a kafir or Murtad as you've labeled them and they don't Entertain or endorse what you believe and if you say something it would backfire Against Islam and the Muslims and would make more chaos in this case. Don't open your mouth but if you think that it's a Ground for a good debate that you could put with knowledge with proper etiquette with wisdom what is beneficial for them To listen and maybe benefit them Alhamdulillah, you can do that and Allah azawajal knows best You"
