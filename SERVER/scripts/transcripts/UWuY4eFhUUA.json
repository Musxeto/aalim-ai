  "transcript": "the question is should she make up for the prayers missed in these three days the answer is no and even if she praised them a thousand times Allah will not accept it from her because each prayer is prescribed to a specific time has a beginning and end you can't pray it before the time and you also cannot pray it after the time has ended so she cannot offer them back and may Allah have mercy upon us all foreign"
