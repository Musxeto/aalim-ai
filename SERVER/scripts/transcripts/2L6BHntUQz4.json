  "transcript": "sure sorry I have a question did they build the the Kaaba or this building as it is now well that's a very good question some say that there were traces of a building there built by Adam and they built it on the foundations of it others say no they've erected it from scratch but it is not exactly what it is nowadays because the Kaaba if you look at it inshallah we will try to do something about this uh if you look at the cubic building you'll find that at one end of it there is an arc-like wall where people do not go inside it but go outside it has your smile I think they call it Ismail and this name is wrong it has nothing to do with Ishmael it has nothing to do with heger this is called al-hatim the thing that was demolished and fell down and why was that because at the time of the Prophet saws we were supposed to go through this but we will come inshallah later on on later stages the Kaaba as it was built in at the time of Ibrahim was there until a flood came and made some parts of it fall so the people of quraish before Islam decided to build it but they decided to build it from their own pure Halal money which meant that no prostitution fees would be included that no interest money would be included no money of wine selling or no money stolen money would be used so they've agreed they've gathered the money they started building the Kaaba and made it a little bit higher than it was because it was this high they made it higher two or three uh uh meters high but at the end of the day they were short of money so they had to leave this area without any building so they just simply put that Arc so to indicate that these are these are the foundations of the real foundations of the Kaaba and that is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told may Allah please with him his wife that the only reason that is preventing me from demolishing the Kaaba and building it all over again on the same foundations of Abraham and Ishmael is that your people were you know uh almost a few years ago non-muslims they were in the ignorance the era of ignorance so if I do this they may reject what I'm doing otherwise I would have demolished it and built it on the foundations of Abraham and had two doors for it one for people to enter from and one for them to exit from so yes true the Foundations at the moment are not the same as the times of Abraham but we can clearly see it"
