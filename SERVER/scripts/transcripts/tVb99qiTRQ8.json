  "title": "How to make up Fasts we broke intentionally & Prayers missed in our Non Practicing Days",
  "transcript": "from the u.s okay so there's a girl and she like many muslims started practicing like uh maybe a year and a half ago and after a while she realized that the ramadan that passed while she wasn't practicing she most likely broke her fast during the day and she didn't pray her salah she's not even sure if she intended to fast a day or not so she's not sure whether like she's not sure how many days she broke her face and how many days she didn't so she should she just make up the whole ramadan that she technically wasn't practicing so that like it's not you know okay i would answer inshallah um from the u.s she says that like many other muslims there are so many girls and boys who started to practice now and with the grace of allah this is a great victory so many youngsters are coming strongly to the deen despite all the fitnah despite all the calamities despite the vicious war that the disbelievers wage against islam against hijab against morality against ethics despite all their attempts to shove lgbtq down our throats even in elementary schools yet there are so many youngsters boys and girls who are coming strongly to the dean abiding by it knowing and acknowledging that this is my way of life and no one would snatch this away from me this is my identity that i'm proud of and not ashamed of being a muslim i'm not ashamed of following the quran the sunnah blindly i'm not ashamed of being a servant to the one who created the heavens and the earth i'm not ashamed of my scarf of my hijab i'm not ashamed of my beard i'm not as ashamed of prostrating to allah and telling the truth never lying never cheating never harming people i'm not ashamed of that these boys and girls are coming strongly islam but the turning point was a year or two ago before that they were not punctual on their prayers or on fasting or on the other rituals of islam now they're doubtful what should we do first of all if you skipped i'm talking about fasting prayers you cannot make them up it's gone so it's history repent ask allah for forgiveness have deep promotion in your heart and do as many voluntary prayers as you can just for the sake of allah and allah will forgive all what has been in the past as for fasting if you were totally negligent so the whole month of ramadan from night time before you go to bed you have the intention of i'm not going to fast tomorrow even if i pretend that i'm fasting for my parents i'm not fasting actually the moment i go to school i'm going to get my m ms and a glass of milk and that's it maybe a tuna sandwich after allah prayer and that's it so the intention was not to fast and the guy does not fast at all this day cannot be made up so if you skipped a whole month few years through this wave then you do not make them up when do i make up missed fastings when you intend to fast tomorrow so tomorrow is monday tonight before going to bed i have a pre-dawn meal i'm or i don't i am intending to fast tomorrow because it's ramadan i wake up tomorrow at 9 10 i'm fasting 11 o'clock i feel hungry i said what the heck i'm gonna break my fast i drink and eat this day is a debt upon you you have to make it up because you started fasting and you broke it so you have to make it make them up you have to estimate i don't know how many days give a figure and put few days extra and make them up so if i say thousand days you know that's a lot if i say five days you know that's too little you add and subtract and so on until you reach a a fine number that you feel it's closer to reality and make that up you"
