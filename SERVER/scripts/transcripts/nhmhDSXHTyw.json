  "transcript": "actually i just want to know the ruling of zakah on land taken with the intention to just like you know for the sake of trade for the sake of business and if it is taken uh like you know 10 years before so do i have to just calculate the amount and do i have to pay the zakah when you say it was taken for the sake of business do you mean to tell me that when you bought it 10 years ago you are trying to sell it and there's no customer coming for it yes uh uh shaykh actually no uh i we were just waiting for the amount like you know i at least we should get some more amount so if like you know before that do i have to pay the zakah and calculate like all these years if if some do i want to sell my head where do you think i would like to sell this yes or no yes do you think i would like to sell this is it for sale yes or no no no if someone comes and says take a thousand reals and give it to me do you think i will give it to him no of course i will i will definitely give him my uh head where my top where or whatever they call it definitely see i'll explain it to you the categories of zakat are four the fourth category is merchandise prepared to be sold and bought for the sake of investment and increasing your wealth so everything you see here is not for sale my car is not for sale my house is not for sale but if someone all of a sudden comes and says sheikh would you like to sell the pen for a hundred dollars and this pen costs cents of course do i have to pay zakat for it no why because it was not intended to make money and sell and buy like grocery items on the shelves in a supermarket these are intended to be sold and bought so the cycle of money is revolving and increasing this is accountable if i buy a plot or a property or a bunch of houses and i just leave them for rent or i just leave them for maybe in the future it will increase in its price and i'm not displaying them for sale there is no zakat on that according to the most authentic opinion but if i buy a plot oh this is three hundred thousand dollars property worth of okay buy it i immediately buy it and i go around the real estate agents say listen i have a property and i'm interested to get 400 000 for it and if i can get more i'll give you 10 of the profit now this is merchandise prepared for trading and there is zakat on it even if i don't sell it for five six years because i'm looking for someone to buy it and i'm displaying it and the moment i sell it i'm gonna buy something bigger and display it for sell sale again so this is zakatable so in a nutshell these 10 years that have fast there is no zakat on it and allah knows best you"
