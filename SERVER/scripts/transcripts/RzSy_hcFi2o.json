  "transcript": "Who do we have next? Abdul Rahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh I had a question regarding the mixture of classes like in the U.S. sometimes They have classes that are for boys and girls with a divider in between Now my question is, is it halal for a Sheikh to be teaching that class? And is it halal for me to attend those classes? These classes are Islamic classes you're talking about? Yeah So Akhi, in the West it's not like elsewhere Because due to the resources are not as in Muslim countries or in Arab countries and the likes Sometimes they are unable to segregate properly But if these classes are segregated in the sense that women are in one side and men are on one side There is no free mixing and they're abiding by the proper hijab There's no problem for the Sheikh to teach such a class And there's no problem for men to attend such a class because it's segregated and it's not freely mixed And Allah knows best Thank you"
