  "title": "Is it Sunnah to Dye a White Beard?",
  "transcript": "Zaid says, is it sunnah to dye our \nbeards? This is an issue of dispute.   And the most authentic opinion is that it is \nhighly recommended to dye the whiteness of the   beard, but it is not mandatory. In a hadith, \nthe Prophet said (aleyhi salatu wa salam),   that the Jews and the Christians do not dye \ntheir beards, so dye yours. Okay, dye yours,   this is an order. If it's an order, why aren't you \ncomplying, Sheikh? Well, there are other evidences   reducing it from an obligation to \na recommendation. Among them is,   the fact that the Prophet aleyhi salatu wa salam, \nwas known to have some white hairs in his beard,   his sideburns and his hair and that he did not dye \nit. Also 'Umar and 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with   them, two of the great four caliphs among the ten \nheaven-bound, had white beards and never dyed it.   So these evidences and others all indicate that \nit is not mandatory to dye. And of course, we have   other evidences praising one strand of white \nhair to be light in the face of the individual   and how the Prophet ﷺ prohibited plucking them \nout, etc. So all of these indicate that it is   a recommendation but not an obligation to dye your \nwhite hair. For me, personally, I would love to   but the problem is every couple of weeks you have \nto repeat that and it consumes time and it makes   a great mess to prepare the dye. So I think maybe \nI'm better off without it. And Allah knows best."
