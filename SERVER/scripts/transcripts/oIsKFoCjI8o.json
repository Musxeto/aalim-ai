  "title": "How much Zakat am I obliged to pay & do I have to ask the poor how much they need for a year",
  "transcript": "Ibn Quraishi from Pakistan I have stated this in my previous answer when I said that if your zakat money is $250 then you give them $250 which is beyond or below their need for a whole year. Their whole year they need $3,000 but my zakat is $250 so I give them $250. If my zakat is $10,000 I can give them whatever I want. I don't have to give them $3,000 that would suffice them for a whole year. I must not exceed $3,000. I have to limit it to $3,000. But sometimes my zakat is $10,000 and I deem to give this poor person $500, another one $1,000, and another one $2,000. So it's not an obligation that I have to give the whole lump sum to an individual. I can estimate and evaluate according to my judgment which is to be given and who to prioritize and how much and I hope this answers your question. Thank you for watching. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
