  "transcript": "A brother from Japan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Or a sister So I'm working for an organization where we receive funds from donors, different donors However the top management doesn't spend all the funds They even implement two years project in one year Then report it to the donor like they've implemented two years project So I was saying like can I report this issue to the donor While asking them or requesting them that my identity should be kept confidential Because if my office get to know this one I'm sure they will fire me And I had to work, I had to provide for my family for example So what is the ruling on this issue in Islam? Jazak Allah Khair This is an Islamic organization? No, we are working for prisoners So we are providing a pro bono legal assistance to them Okay, so if there is fraud and the donors don't know about it It is permissible for you to anonymously go and tell them In order for this fraud to stop and end If there is no fraud, rather the donor give and the management Maybe not disclose the full truth but there is no fraud They are utilizing the funds and the money into a duration of a year or two Just to prove that they are doing something good or this or that But there is no actual lying or cheating or taking the funds And misusing it in somewhere that the donors don't want No, this is not the right thing to do But if there is fraud, if there is cheating If there is manipulation of funds in means other than the donors wanted or agreed for In this case, yes you can do this anonymously without disclosing your identity And Allah Azzawajal knows best"
