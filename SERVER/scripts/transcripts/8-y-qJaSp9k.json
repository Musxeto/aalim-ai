  "title": "Can we buy a house from a Bank (Mortgage)? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "pani bent and ford says so could we could buy a house from a bank buying a house from a bank from a murderer from a fornicator from a kafir from a mushrik is permissible buying and selling there's nothing wrong in that it doesn't matter what religion the person you're buying from is whether it's sinful or not so buying a property from a person is permissible now your question is not that your question is is it permissible to buy a house in mortgage from a bank so you have to be clear when you're asking a question because buying from a bank can be halal can be haram example bank xyz bought a neighborhood consisting of 20 houses and now he's willing to sell them over the period of 20 years and he would charge interest in the halal way so the money the the house costs five hundred thousand dollars he'll sell it for seven fifty thousand dollars over the duration of 20 years and the month the amount is fixed it cannot be increased more than 750 000 no matter what happens what's the ruling the transaction is 100 percent what the bank is interest based it's a conventional bank yeah i know i'm talking about the transaction the buying and the selling is the bank selling something that belongs to it yeah is the price fixed yeah what's the problem then no problem so whether you buy it from a bank or from a jew it's the same thing secondly the bank sells you a house that you would like to buy with a fixed price but the bank doesn't own it explain more i have a property this beautiful villa and it's on the beach it costs cash 500 000 i don't have the money i go to the bank the bank says i'll buy the house and sell it to you for 750 fixed price over the period of 20 years i said okay i agree he said sign these documents this contract and after i sign and commit he goes and buy the house this is halal because he sold you what it does not possess the third scenario is that the bank gives you the money for the mortgage here's five hundred thousand dollars cash you buy the property in your name and you pay the bank seven fifty thousand this is clear mortgage there are fourth and fifth scenarios where the bank has a pay a late payment fee or increases the final amount or the final amount is fluctuating depending on the inflation rate the interest rate etc so the 750 can easily go to 900 000 as we speak all of this is riba and halam so i hope this answers your question pami"
