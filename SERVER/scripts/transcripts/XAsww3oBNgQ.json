  "title": "Remove evil eye with wudu water if you know who gave evil eye",
  "transcript": "now if someone knows the person that made this evil lie to him there is a cure for that so the prophet when he rebuked he ordered him to wash himself and collect the water so Amir did exactly as the prophet ordered himat he washed his face he washed his hands his elbows his knees the side of his feet and the inside of his waist wrapper and collected all this in a pot or in a bucket and then the prophet ordered someone to come from behind sah and to pour it over his head and back and to turn the bucket upside down so this is the format so did what the prophet said and the collected water was thrown on sah in the same fashion the prophet commanded and all of a sudden sahal stood up as nothing was ever wrong with him and he started walking in acting normally so this is a fact when such a mistake takes place you direct the PE to the people to what blocks it and how to rectify it nowadays unfortunately people are not like that if someone says such an evil comment and you notice that this had negatively impacted your life and you go to them and you ask them to wash in the same fashion they would reject you they would say you're crazy and you tell them about the Hadith still they don't apply it unfortunately people don't have Iman they don't have belief what to do"
