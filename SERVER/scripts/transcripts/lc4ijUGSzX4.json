  "transcript": "Shafiq, I want to ask some tips from you guys, from you Ustad, about how to find a real spiritual Ustad, because in this time of period of fitna, we don't really know who is telling the truth about the Quran and Hadith. Okay, but sometimes, there is some saying, by my experience, I follow some Ustad and they say, oh don't follow that guy, that guy is a hawaiz or something, or don't follow that guy, that guy is a bojima. So, sometimes this kind of treatment gives us the youth, that really, I don't even want to learn Islam, getting confused. So, is there any tips from you Ustad? Thank you. Jazakallahu Khairan. First of all, no one is perfect. Even me, unfortunately. Nobody is perfect. And I've heard you say this so many times, a scholar like you, a scholar like you. In Arabic, a scholar is a alim. I am not a alim, I'm a student of knowledge. I sat with ulema like Ibn Baz, Ibn Uthaymeen, Al Bani. If you sit with them, you will think yourself to be, what am I? Nothing, zero. But to you, you don't have any like those. So, unfortunately, you see us like alims, but we're not. Now, the youth must never, ever engage in labeling. This is a very dangerous game. What are you? Sufi? Salafi? Wahhabi? Ikhwani? Akhwati? What are you? I have to give you a label, I have to give you a sticker. No, this is very bad. Focus on learning the religion as was revealed to the Prophet, how? By reading the Quran, learning it. When you read the Quran and learn it, you don't ask, Khawarij, Mujia, no. I'm learning the Quran. Learn the sunnah, learn the proper aqeedah, according to Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. Khawarij will say, no, don't do it. Mujia would say, no, don't do it. No, no, we say the way of the Prophet is the best of ways. If you focus on learning what is beneficial for you, you will not have a problem. The moment you watch YouTube channel, Sheikh so-and-so is refuting Sheikh so-and-so, putting the gloves. Okay, this is very good. Let me bring my popcorn. Okay, what did the other Sheikh say? Oh, next week he's going to refute him. Good, let's watch. You waste your time, you waste your energy, and you make your heart hard and black. Because if you meet the other Sheikh, you don't want to speak to him, you don't want to give him salam. Don't do this. Wallahi, I don't spend seconds on watching these refutations. Some of them are friends of mine. Some of them call me, Sheikh Asim, what do you think? I said, don't call me. Don't ask me. What you're doing is bad. But Sheikh said bad things. I have to refute him. I have to say this and that. Everyone who says bad things about you, will it become true? If someone says to you, you're an ass. Sometimes they say to me, you're an ass. I said, yes, this is my nickname. Ass I am. So, someone says to me, you're an ass. My students say, oh, very angry. Sheikh, he's insulting you. When he says, I'm an ass, will I grow two ears and a tail? I don't care what he says. Say whatever you want. You're not going to make me go down. And when you praise me, I'm not going to go up. So, focus on learning the religion of Allah, not following individuals, not having allegiance to Sheikh so-and-so, or group so-and-so. This is not Islam. Your allegiance is to Quran, to Sunnah, with the understanding of the three favorite generations. And I hope this answers your question."
