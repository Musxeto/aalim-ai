  "title": "Is it ok to make an investment where I receive a fixed amount, & can withdraw my capital if I exit?",
  "transcript": "Khan from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So a person runs a Baqala and I give him 10,000 riyals to invest and he gives me money monthly. Since taking fixed amount of money monthly is not permissible, but there is no way to calculate monthly profit in such small shops because there is no monthly calculation and the money just comes in and goes out. So he says he will give me near about 800 to 900 riyals monthly. It is not 100% fixed, but it will be in the range of 800 to 900. And also when I want to stop this partnership, I inform him one month in advance and he will return my original 10,000 riyals to me. Is this fine? If not, then how it should be done? Jazakum. This is totally prohibited Khan. You see, an investment is when you inject money in an institution and you are prone to profit and loss. There is a sharing. The moment the capital, which is the 10,000 riyals, is guaranteed to come back to you, this is riba. Why? Because this is not an investment. This is a loan. I'm giving the shopkeeper a 10,000 riyal loan and he gives me interest, riba. 800, 900, whether it's fixed or not, regardless. Whenever I want to bail out, he gives me back my capital, which is the original loan. This is riba, totally. The only way to have this valid is to evaluate the grocery shop. So we come to the grocery shop. How much does it cost as we stand today? What is the market value? People of expertise come and say, this costs 100,000. So I'm injecting 10,000. This is the ratio, 1 to 10. This is my percentage. And he has to calculate the profit and do his book work every three months or six months and give you the profit as a percentage, meaning you agree with him that you'll take 50% of the profit or 30% or 10% or 1%, depending on what you agree upon. This is the percentage of the profit calculated. You say he doesn't calculate it. Don't go into business with him. This is not permissible to go in such ambiguity. He has to do his homework and calculate the percentage to calculate the profit on monthly basis or quarterly basis and then give you a percentage that you agree beforehand. If the shop was burnt to the ground, you lose your 10,000, he loses his 100,000. So you lost the whole thing. You can't ask him for any compensation because there was no mistake on his part. So this is the only way of investing. Now, if you agree to invest for two, three years, and at the end of the three years, the contract is over, there's no problem. Re-evaluate the value of the grocery shop. If they say now it's 200,000, then you take 20. If they say that we've depreciated it and it's 50,000, you take 5,000. And Allah knows best."
