  "title": "Reciting Fatiha behind an Imam, in loud & silent prayers? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "idris from pakistan says that when i join the imam in congregation what about the fatiha this is a big issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion is what sheikhou islamic has chosen and sheikh al-bani and before all of them imam malik may allah have mercy on their souls which indicates that reciting the fatiha in loud prayers behind the imam for the moon for the follower is not mandatory but reciting it in all silent raqqa throughout the whole prayers is a pillar of salat now it is recommended if you can find the time and you have no problem to recite the fatiha in loud prayers that's nice but if you don't either because you don't want to or you couldn't there's no problem in that none whatsoever so if you come and join the congregation late and the imam has already recited the fatiha before you joined and you joined at the end of the first raka recitation of his is sufficient for you you don't have to recite it and your rakha is valid and allah knows best you"
