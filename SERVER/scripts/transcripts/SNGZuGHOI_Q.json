  "title": "People Try To Move Me From Prayer Spot",
  "transcript": "The next question is, after praying Salat, I prefer to stay in my position so that the angels ask forgiveness from me. But there are many people around who try to move me or walk over me. And when I'm not moved, they find me to be motionless. Stay in your position. Who dares to move you? What are you, Akhi? Transferable items? Anybody who comes and tries to move you, go pray anywhere. Why do you want to come to this spot of mine? This is ridiculous. No, this seems that you have low self-esteem. You think that everybody is looking at you. You hear people, you think that they're talking about you. So this is your shaitan giving you OCD that people want to jump over me. They're going to kill me. So pray and let the angels pray on you, inshallah, and make dua for you. I'll make dua for you as well."
