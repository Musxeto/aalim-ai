  "transcript": "And have you lost your job? Among us, many people who are jobless, they're striving, they're looking for a job, and they feel that Allah hates them. They feel that they're doing du'a and Allah doesn't answer them. Why is Allah not answering me? What have I done to them? They're complaining, and they're wrong. Look at Prophet Musa, one of the strong-willed messengers. Subhanallah, Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa and Muhammad Alayhi Salaam. The best of all messengers. Musa, did he lose his job? He was deprived from being with his mom since birth, and he was raised in the house and the mansion of his own enemy. And he goes, once he reaches youth and adulthood, he goes into the city. He finds one of his clan fighting with another. He tries to help, he just pushes the other and he dies. He flees the country and becomes an expat for 10 years working as a shepherd to just find food and a decent wife. So how do you think he feels? Did he say Allah is not giving me? He trusted Allah Azza wa Jal and look what Allah did to"
