  "transcript": "uh number three ali says i want to ask if watching anime like naruto is halal or macro what is narotto naruto or ozomaki naruto is an anime cartoons japanese cartoons that came like 20 plus years ago and they started in series and it talks about the community of the ninja and how there was a demon known as the nine-tailed fox who was spreading corruption and chaos in the place until one of their masters managed to capture it and put it and imprison it in his newborn child it talks about the life of the child and how things are happening etc blah blah blah now lots of the people said that this is an innocent thing but even the disbelievers raised red flags because this had many issues to them as disbelievers let alone to us as muslims among these things for example that there are subtle hints of sexuality in it so this naruto had a crush on his teacher how is this possible again lgbt is he a transgender in one of the episode he comes in the form of a woman wearing bikini trying to seduce his sensei or teacher along with other men who act like women though they are men so this is promoting transgenders promoting homosexuality from a hidden angle as muslims we are very careful to what we see because we acknowledge that such influence of the media is very dire and dangerous especially on our children and this is why even the most innocent of all cartoons may have such embedded messages not necessarily directed to the muslims they don't care they just want to spread evil and to raise our children on what they want them to believe even tom and jerry you will find such hints when the mouse wears a bikini and dance the hawaiian way of dancing and tries to seduce others this seems innocent but it is not our children when they're three or four years of age watching this this has a negative impact as they grow so for us muslims we have to be very protective from watching such filth that doesn't get us closer to allah but shaykh it's fun yeah i know it's fun it can easily consume five or six hours of your day because you're addicted to it and the bad part is even if you spend six hours a day and you've had enough you turn it off what happens the moment you see your mom or dad or someone close to you i'm bored you've just spent six hours watching something you like yeah but still i'm bored because this is an addiction it doesn't fulfill the vacuum in your heart and this is why we need to address this issue with islamic alternative with sports clubs with places where kids can hang out safely and learn good things with righteous practicing muslims and allah azza knows best"
