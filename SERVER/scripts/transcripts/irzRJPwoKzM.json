  "title": "OCD & Overthinking Each time I find a job, I find some haram in it, what to do",
  "transcript": "[Music] stephen from france uh so i want to know how what are the rules guidelines to choose a job isn't it correct in accordance with the quran and the sunnah so i can descend independently in the future whatever the job is each time i feel i found a correct job i figure out some things around to me in it and give up on doing it is the question by itself is very generic and when a person does not have the proper knowledge shaytan whispers in his ears and makes him think that um can i speak in the phone because the phone may distort my voice and the voice goes across seas and the sheriff hears me and then maybe he thinks blah blah blah and shaytan throws things in like this in your ear in your head one of the biggest reason reasons for people to have ocd or two whispers of shaytan is overthinking we have certain rules and regulations in islam that governs our lives and the default everything is halal is that the default yep everything is halal until proven otherwise so can i drink tea from this cup yes maybe the water is not pure maybe the people who made and collected these tea were using children maybe this may be that the default it's it's hot it's nice until proven otherwise without any proof move on don't look back we come to jobs and many jobs are there for display but shaytan comes and says oh maybe this job is aram the french don't pronounce the h when it comes in the beginning of the word so they don't say hotel they say hotel so is it haram or not the default it is halal until proven otherwise what makes a job haram the existence of haram elements that are made by choice so i sell bottles of water oh my job is haram why he says because someone can take the bottle and make ice cubes and drinks it with his uh martini or with his vodka so this is illogical you're selling something halal and you don't know about his intention there's nothing wrong in your work or job see how shaytan makes you overthink the job has free mixing i live in a cafe country i'm a muslim i have to earn i am the breadwinner so what can i do work but have these barriers that islam tells you about lowering your gaze don't communicate unless it is necessary no physical contact and do not socialize or  chat do your job you have a job description do it nowhere says you have to go for lunch with your colleagues of the opposite gender or you have to say bonjour it's not of your business to socialize work is work so in order for you to know what is halal and what is haram you have to go to to the basics if you're doubtful you have to call the sheikh go to the imam of the message tell him i have this particular job and these are the concerns that i have whether it's he will tell you insha allah and allah azza knows best you"
