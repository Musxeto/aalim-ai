  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Uganda if I see the person in \na house and this person brings a man into the   house would I be slandering her if I say she \nfornicated without bringing four Witnesses of   course 100 slandering if you see a woman with a \nman and they go into a closed room and they stay   there for eight hours and they come out and you \nsay that they fornicated this is slandering even   if they if they spent three days and three nights \nthis is slandering this cannot be said at all   because accusing someone of Zina a fornication \nor adultery requires that four male Witnesses so   even if there were ten women present and they \nsaw the actual intercourse between this Nan   mahram man with this stranger woman and they saw \nit with their own eyes and they reported it they   will the ten women will be flogged 80 lashes \nbecause they are not allowed to testify this   testimony must be done by four male Witnesses and \nnot a single woman among them and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
