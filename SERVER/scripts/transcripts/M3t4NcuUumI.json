  "transcript": "mustafa from bangladesh so my question is like um one used to be very motivated and sincere in the in islam but now he is um unmotivated and he lost his sincerity so how to bring back the sincerity and motivation he used to have okay i will answer inshallah mustafa from bangladesh says i used to be a a positive person and i used to be enthusiastic and full of energy towards things of islam now i've lost all of that how can i restore it well this requires a coaching lesson with some one you sit with you talk with and you tell him about your lifestyle what came up what's new because some of the folks who used to be on the straight path who used to be steadfast on islam used to be positive thinking reciting the quran praying in the masjid one social media app destroys their lives they go they watched it it was fun five minutes a day then it came to be half an hour a day then they became addicted to it until they started losing salat not focusing in the quran indulging in sins because of what they see and want to impersonate and to live that type of life because of one app only so if you were able to pinpoint the turning point where you started having these problems you can block the means but you need to sit with a sheikh in the masjid to motivate you to help you write a schedule for you to gather along with other uh um righteous practicing muslims to be with to hang out with 24 7 so that you could change the environment you're in and maybe allah azza would bless you with getting back to where you were before and allah you"
