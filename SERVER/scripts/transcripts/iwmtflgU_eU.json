  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India So my question is are we going to be rewarded \non the basis of our efforts or accomplishments?   For instance, isn't it Allah who blesses \npeople with abilities more than others,   and if I have high aspirations such as becoming a \ngreat scholar and spreading the message of Islam   throughout the world, and I give my 100% effort \ntowards this goal for Allah's pleasure, but I lack   the abilities to do so, am I going to be rewarded \nfor actually having done the deed if my intentions   are clean and pure? JazakAllah Khair Wajazakum \nThe prophet said, Alayhi Salatu Was-Salam,   Innamal a'amalu binniyat Verily deeds are held \naccountable according to their intentions.   So everything is in Allah's hands, in the sense \nthat it's not for you and me to judge things.   We are ordered to perform and to \ndo what Allah has told us to do.   Whether we achieve our objectives or not, as \nlong as we are doing what we are supposed to do,   Allah will reward us accordingly. \nNow shaytan will make you overthink,   I have this objective but I can't reach it. \nSo I will try to be lazy, maybe I'll give up,   and this is how shaytan works. No, you \ndo whatever Allah has ordered you to do,   and do it to the best of your ability. If you \nsucceed, Alhamdulillah if you've reached your   objective and mission is accomplished, Allah will \nreward you greatly. If you happen to fall short,   or was unable to accomplish all what you wanted \nor desired, Allah would reward you as if you have   accomplished it, because your intention was to \ndo it, and you went all the way out to do it, and   it was Allah's will not to be accomplished. \nSo I hope this answers your question."
