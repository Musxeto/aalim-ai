  "transcript": "Halima from France As-Salamu Alaikum Sheikh Yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Yes, sir. Because the relationship between me and my father for now is very bad So I can remember he once told me that I can talk to my potential spouse in I can talk to him on phone. So actually they have brought I've been I've been scared of being in seclusion with him because I called him yesterday So there is nothing about being using bedroom voice or staying log on the phone just to talk about How is elder brother is going to call my elder brother or how my elder brother is going to call him? So the question is can I continue to talk to him in seclusion or I should stop the seclusion, sir? No, this is not permissible for you to go behind your father's back and calling a non-mahram on the phone and Chit-chatting Nobody says that this is permissible if your father is transgressing and blocking all potential Stewarders that are good for you for no apparent reason we said that his guardianship is Transferred to the next in line. So your eldest brother would count as your guardian When there is oppression and Transgression from your father when it comes to marrying a suitable suitor Knowing that through his track record that he rejected six or seven good ones or he doesn't want to meet anyone Just because he doesn't want to or to pressure you in this case. Yes but to go on one-to-one and Uplift the veil of bashfulness and shyness To talk to a stranger on the phone. This is dating. This is not permissible it has to be supervised by your mahram and he has to be with you and Governing every move you make and Allah knows best"
