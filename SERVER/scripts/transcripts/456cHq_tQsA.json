  "title": "Forgot to say Sami Allah huliman hamidah or Allahuakbar, do I say it AFTER reaching next position",
  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Salamu Alaikum My question is, the mandatory actions in Salah, like Allahu Akbar, the Azkar you say between the pillars, If you forget to say it when you're coming from Ruku' for example, and you remember it once you're standing and erect, do you have to say it, or it makes a difference? No, you have to say it. Now, of course you're wrong in saying it after you've reached the pillar, because these are known as Takbeeratul Intiqal, the Takbeer that is to move from one pillar to the other. So it should be done between the two pillars. So if I'm in the standing position and want to go to Sujood, I should say Allahu Akbar, not Allahu Akbar then move, and not after reaching the Sujood and saying Allahu Akbar. So it has to be in between. If I forgot and I reach already the Sujood position, a lot of the scholars say that prayer is invalid, some say this is sinful, and the most authentic opinion inshallah is that due to necessity or ignorance or forgetfulness, this is valid once you say it, it does the job and Allah knows best."
