  "title": "How can a wife stop her husband from watching TV & Movies? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "How can a wife influence to his husband to stop like watching haram movies in the house or you know towards more to the religion without disrespecting him? Okay I don't know. Okay. It's a long topic Mariam and we have less than one minute before the episode ends but in a nutshell I've said this gazillion times. Watching inappropriate movies, listening to music, a woman not wearing the hijab, someone not praying on time, someone who does drugs, someone who smokes, someone who free mixes all of these are symptoms of an illness not the real chronic illness. You fix the real chronic illness and all these symptoms will disappear like a headache. I have cancer I will have migraines. You can't give me Tylenol all the time to subdue the headaches because they will come after five six hours. Treat the cancer the headaches will be gone. So what I advise you to do is to focus on the void in his heart. He doesn't know Allah. He doesn't know Allah's beautiful names and attributes. He does not know what Islam is really is. Once he's aligned with Sharia, he knows this is Quran, this is the Sunnah, he knows that Allah is watching him, Allah is listening to what he's listening to. When you provide him with the alternative because he's watching haram, he has a lot of time on his hands. If you fill his time with beneficial things, being with him, giving him quality time, preoccupying him with halal entertainment in the house, you do this to him, he will inshallah learn and hopefully stop."
