  "transcript": "This name from the US. I have a question about my menstrual cycle. I've had very irregular menses and this has been the most irregular. So I've had it for about three weeks now and this has never happened. So I'm in a lot of confusion. About three Fridays ago I saw some blood and I thought it was spotting but later on in the day it was a lot more. It was excessive for spotting so I assumed it was my period and the blood continued for about six days and on the sixth day it was supposed to stop and it did stop for a bit and then there was a flow. Suddenly there was a flow and after that flow there was no other flow but then the blood continued just like before and during this time the blood was thick and dark but there was also times that it was thin and light and this bleeding continued for three more weeks and I had just that one flow, that one random flow and then two or three days ago I had another random flow that lasted for two days and then the blood went back to being light but still like dark and thick. So now I'm not sure when my period should have been considered started. Was it the first day that it started to bleed or the first time that I felt a flow or the second time that I felt a flow and today would be my 16th day I think so I don't know when to consider my the starting of my period. Okay this this is too long. If I have only one minute and 15 seconds to conclude this segment but basically speaking whenever a woman gets the flow of the blood this is her menses. Rule number one. Rule number two. Her menses cannot be ended until she sees the sign of purity whether the white thread like discharge or the dryness the total dryness without any colored discharges. Rule number three is that her menses cannot continue for a collective of 15 days per month even if she has her period then a moment of purity for a day or two then another period then a moment of purity and then a third period the the total of these days of menses must not exceed 15 days otherwise after the 15 days we consider this to be istihada. She takes ghusl, she prays and cleans herself after the adhan of every single prayer and she resumes her life normally. Now in your case if you saw the flow of the blood not the spotting not the light bleeding in the beginning but the flow of blood this is when your menses starts. If it was interrupted by a day or less but resumed again you should continue considering to be menses because you did not see a sign of your purity white thread like discharge or dryness. Once you finish 15 days you make your ghusl fast pray and do as I said to you earlier. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you. If you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
