  "transcript": "And Diani from Indonesia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh May Allah always protect you so there's a grave of my brother that has a wall built over him and I have communicated with my parents to dismantle it but they don't seem to be happy about it so how should I behave towards them in this matter Jazak Allah Khair First of all building a wall over a grave is not permissible Sahih Muslim Abu Al Hayyaj Al Asdi said that Ali Ibn Abi Talib may Allah be pleased with him said to him shall I send you exactly on the same mission that the Prophet sent me alayhis salatu Wassalam the Prophet sent me and told me not to leave any portrait without dismantling it or covering the face and removing the facial features so that it won't be a portrait of a human being and not to leave any grave that is above the ground without leveling it so from this hadith it is a well-known fact in Islam that it is not at all permissible to build walls or to raise a grave like we see nowadays where they have like shrines and they build tombs over it this is all totally prohibited now if you have the power to remove it without causing a bigger fitna then you should but if you don't or you will be maybe taken by the police incarcerated for a crime or your parents would disown you and do harmful things to you in this case advising them is all what you can do and Allah knows best"
