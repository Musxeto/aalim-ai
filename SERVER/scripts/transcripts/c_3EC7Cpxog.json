  "transcript": "uh abdel aziz from sri lanka yes my question today is uh i have been uh falling ill lately for no medical courses and i go to the doctor and they can't find the course and i have been trying to do rookia but i i i was doing it for some time and i tried i prayed to allah but i felt like it was it was not properly working i mean i tried my best so is it okay to keep an intention that i can go to umbra and make dua to allah to kill me from whatever it is that is hidden from me and harming me okay first of all allah azzawajal as in the hadith did not create an illness without creating a cure to it some would know it others may not know the cure so definitely whatever has fallen to you or whatever illness you've fallen into is curable how this is something we have to try if the doctors say we are unable to identify change the doctors go to other doctors and keep pursuing a cure for that secondly rookie is all the time on the top of the list of your healing process keep on reading the fatiha gazillion times per day on water drink it recite it in your hand and wipe over your body after you blow fatiha is a rookia that is unmatched it's the best rookie ever and it's one of his names is a shafiyah the one that heals with the grace of allah thirdly to go to umrah with the intention that this is a blessed place and it's a blessed time and making umrah cleanses me from sins and it's a place for answering my dua there's no problem in that with the intention that allah cures you allah has billions and trillions of his creation all in need of him and he's in not in need of anyone if we don't turn to allah and beg him for help who do we go to so there's no problem inshallah in doing that and allah knows best you"
