  "transcript": "Ibrahima from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh This is a follow up question from yesterday's question So basically one clarification My 1.5 year search was the local search The virtual agency was just some days And then I paused it until I asked about it The current situation is that I have found a potential candidate Who will accept most of the conditions However there are two issues blocking me First of all the free mixing The family basically have an issue completely avoiding free mixing With male cousins Which she grew up with Although I clearly told them that Islam is haram And non-haram are clear obviously The main issue is the niqab part She stated that she is willing to wear the niqab And it tends to but not as the condition of a marriage She wants to wear it whenever she feels ready herself My question is I understand that as a husband I am responsible for my household And ensuring Islamic principles are followed If I permit something impermissible I bear responsibility So if I agree to marry her knowing she will only wear the niqab later When she decides which will be days or years Will I be considered sinful During that interim period of marriage Because I allowed it basically That is my main point As long as there is no other alternative After 1.5 years As you claim And this is The best choice available Then it is permissible For you to marry her While intending and making dua And trying your level best To make her love you Obey you and follow what you believe In accordance to the Quran And to the Sunnah as well"
