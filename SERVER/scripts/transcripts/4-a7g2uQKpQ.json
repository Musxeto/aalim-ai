  "transcript": "Regarding the issue of mental health, the mental illness, what does Qur'an say about the mental illness? Is there any solution in the Qur'an how we deal with mental health or mental illness? Mental illness is like physical illness. You get a virus, you get microbes, you get bacteria infection. This is happening to your body. Also, mental illness, you have a lot of depression, you have sadness. Nowadays, they have more and more bipolar, borderline illness, etc. And all of these may not be mentioned in the Qur'an. In the Qur'an, in the Shari'ah, it says either you're sane or insane. There's nothing in between. So you cannot come and say, Oh Sheikh, I have rage issues. So I may hit or kill someone. But Alhamdulillah, I am mentally unstable so I can run away with it. No, you can't. Are you sane? Yes, but I have rage issues. I have mental illnesses. I take Prozac. I have depression. You're sane. Chop his head off. If you're insane, yes, you're unaccountable. This is why the Prophet said, the pen of accountability is uplifted from three. An insane person until he regains his sanity. So mental illness is there. But I always suggest to Muslims not to go to psychologists or psychiatrists that are not Muslims. It's very bad. They will immediately put you on medication, opioid, and things that would make you addictive. It would make you high, but it is very bad on the long term. Most of these people, and 80% of the counseling sessions I have, is for OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder. They have problems with shirk thoughts. Shaykh, I say shahada 50 times a day. Every time I say something, I smile. Did I commit kufr? I go and take shower. Someone said something, I don't know, maybe it's kufr. I say, ash hadu an la ilaha illallah. People get wiswas in answering the call of nature. Splashes, wudu. Some people come, wallahi, they spend half an hour making wudu. Half an hour. Even if you're in a river, the river is going to run out of water. What is this? And I say to them, I have to go to a psychiatrist. No, no, no, no need. Your treatment is in five minutes. How much water did the prophet use, alayhi salatu wasalam? 0.7 liter for wudu. Yani, maybe one or one and a half of this bottle for wudu. How much water do you use? Oh, 10 gallons. You know more than the prophet, alayhi salatu wasalam? I said, no. This is not Islam you're practicing. They never think like this, because shaitan comes and blocks their intellect. They cannot think. My job is to open your eyes only. So mental illness is there, but go to a Muslim therapist, psychiatrist, who will never give you medication unless you 100% need it. And he will not say to you, oh, Freud said this, and Duck Times said that, and the kafir psychologist or socialist people said this and that. No, he would only use with you what is Islamically accepted. Thank you."
