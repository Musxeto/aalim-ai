  "transcript": "[Questioner] From the UAE my question is about \npaying for breaking an oath so I don't know any   poor people around here and also when the the \nkind of food that I'm trying to get like my   husband buys the big one like 20 dirham and I \nbuy small one like 10 dirham and I'm full so   what do I base this off of because \nit's supposed to be the food that I eat okay I will answer inshallah as for \nquestion when a person breaks his oath   he has to expiate by freeing a Slave \nfeeding ten poor people or clothing them   now she says she's in the Emirates and she doesn't \nknow any poor people well alhamdulillah there are   many places and Islamic organizations and charity \norganizations that you can approach if you call uh   the operator they will direct you I think in \nDubai you have a number of Islamic charity   organizations that Dao organizations that can \nassist you like Kalima like al-manar and the   likes call them and they will direct you as for \nthe food you don't have to take from the food   that you have in the house the Ayah \nrefers to the average type of food you eat   so for example your normal dish is biryani rice \nwith meat or rice with chicken so a full dish   that suffices a person that would be sufficient \nas a meal you don't go and take a shortcut and   say no I'll buy them a shawarma one sandwich or a \nfalafel Tamia because it's cheaper no this is not   from the average you eat every single day and this \nthis is why Scholars say if you don't want to give   cooked food you can just buy a kilo \nand a half of uh rice per person   raw rice and give it to them that suffices for \na single meal for per person Allah Knows Best"
