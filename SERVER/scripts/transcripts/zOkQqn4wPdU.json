  "transcript": "Berton from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh.  How are you Sheikh? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. May Allah Azza Wa Jal bless you Sheikh and your family. And yours as well. Ameen. So my question Sheikh is that there was things like today going on, like happening. Like I was watching some video and there was a brother who said oh I was giving dawah to this person and it was by the Qadr of Allah that I was there. And he said oh I don't believe in chance. So by that I was getting these thoughts, like I was thinking about what's the Islamic ruling on using the word chance. Like I was thinking what does it mean to use the word chance when you say for example oh don't go to this fitness gym because the chance is that you might be sinful. So what's the ruling on this? There is nothing wrong Akhi in using the word chance because it is similar to a possibility. If you cross a busy highway like in Germany for example where they don't have a speed limit in some of their highways. And if you cross it there is a big chance you're going to be run over by a car. So there's a possibility. If you mean a coincidence or luck, even the terminology luck was used in the Qur'an. Great fortune, great luck. And a coincidence to our understanding is something that was unplanned. What a coincidence, I met your brother yesterday. By coincidence it was unplanned by both of us but no one of us would even think in their wildest dream that this is not part of Allah's Qadr. It is part of Allah's Qadr. And it was a coincidence as well. So I hope this answers your question."
