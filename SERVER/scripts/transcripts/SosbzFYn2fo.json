  "transcript": "pale says what's the ruling on using credit card when it's mandatory in some places how to make it less evil when we have to sign a the river documents credit cards differ from one country to the other and from the necessity from one country to the other for example in some muslim countries we have quote unquote islamic credit cards that do not involve in river and this varies some banks issue truly islamic credit cards you reach the 40 days of grace period and you don't pay off they stop your credit card but they don't charge you any interest over the loan that you had taken some quote unquote islamic banks offer you islamic credit cards but with a twist so it's the same procedure that is followed by interspaced credit cards after 40 days you don't pay they buy on your behalf merchandise with a specific price they sell it to someone you don't know of with a reduced price and then charge you in installments that amount which you had borrowed from the credit card plus their interest and profit so it's a trick to camouflage the interest based rebate that credit cards take and this is not permissible so it differs from one country to another from one islamic bank to another and from one necessity to the other the best thing to do is to get a debit card because with debit cards you charge your card with a thousand dollars and you can use this until you consume the thousand dollars then you have to fill it up and recharge it again the only downfall of this is that some countries don't accept this i heard i'm not sure that in america in order for you to build a credit for you as a an individual they don't accept credit cards they only accept uh uh sorry they don't accept debit cards they only accept credit cards so that they can build your credit port to follow you and know how good you are in paying off your debts i i've heard this from a number of people i don't know how true this is now having said that if you are in a country like the u.s for example and they don't accept credit uh debit cards and they insist on having a credit card i would suggest that due to necessity get one number two authorize the bank to immediately withdraw from your account whatever you purchase so that you don't by any means exceed the grace period it's immediately automatically withdrawn for your bank account thirdly if you can charge in advance your credit card with money so i know that i'm going to cairo for a couple of weeks for vacation and i'll be using my credit card so i deposit in it three thousand dollars up front so i don't i'm not gonna spend three thousand dollars in in cairo in two weeks not even two months it's a nice country it's a cheap country to live in but hypothetically i do this so what would happen so even if i spent a thousand or two or three the money is there and it's been treated like a debit card after 40 days they will take their money and there would be no chances for river and allah knows best you"
