  "title": "ðŸ†• Does he have to give Zakat if he does not earn? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "A brother says, Does a person have to pay Zakat if he does not earn himself and is only given pocket money for his expenses and some money for ledger things? Zakat is due, is mandatory upon a person who possesses the threshold or above and a full lunar Hijri year passes upon this amount in his possession. Whether he earned it through working or through a grant or through inheritance or through a gift, it doesn't matter. So even if a person is an orphan and below the age of puberty, even if a person is insane, yet he possesses money, Zakat is mandatory if these two conditions are fulfilled. So students who don't work nor earn, yet they receive an allowance from their parents or from the school they're studying in or a grant from the government. If this amount reaches a threshold, which is equivalent to the value of 595 grams of silver, approximately 300 dollars give or take. If they possess this amount of money or more and a full lunar year passes with this money in their possession in a bank account under the mattress, wherever they keep the money in, in this case they are obliged to give 2.5 percent as Zakat every single year."
