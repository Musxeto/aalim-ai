  "transcript": "the sec the second question is is it also permissible to say salaam when you are in the in the washroom or someone say it to me but i'm not replying at all because it is a washroom i i as i have not i cannot say salaam or whatever in inside the washroom got you okay i will answer you inshallah her second question was what's the ruling on giving salam or replying to salaam in the toilet the answer is this is not permissible so if someone says to you assalamu alaikum while you are in the toilet the most you could say is alaikum or you can do as the prophet as some did not answer and he would not answer even if he was not on the state of wudu or if someone is as answering the call of nature must not answer not say anything because part of the etiquette of being in the toilet or while answering the call of nature is not to speak at all this is part of the islamic etiquette not to talk until you're through and you're out then you can speak and allah knows best you"
