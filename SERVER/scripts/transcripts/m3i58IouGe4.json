  "transcript": "the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam was asked by a Bedouin I know Matt coming to him and saying o prophet of Allah tell me about salat telling me about soul and the Prophet told him five daily prayers and he said nothing else the Prophet said nothing else unless you want to add some voluntary to it at the end of the hadith the man said by the one who sent you that is by Allah the Almighty I will not do anything more than what you had just said meaning that he will only fast Ramadan he will only pray the five daily followed prayers if he had wealth he would pay zakat if he will perform Hajj once in a lifetime that is it so the Prophet said Ali salat wa salam he has succeeded if he had told the truth and in another narration whoever wants to see a man of Jenna let him look at this person now the person did not say night prayers fasting Mondays and Thursdays etc he just sticked to the basics which is good enough if you manage to refrain from Haram any Haram whether it is by action whether it is by rhetoric whether it is in your heart so envy hatred holding grudges against others etc all of these are sins of the heart if you manage to block them and to refrain from them and to do anything that is good such as helping passers-by and showing him the road guiding someone teaching someone saying a good word smiling in your parents face smiling in your siblings faces etc anything that is good even as small piece of grape giving it to charity that counts as well half a date which is so tiny and usually people would not eat half a day either give me the full one or I don't need it this would be something registered for you on the day of judgment"
