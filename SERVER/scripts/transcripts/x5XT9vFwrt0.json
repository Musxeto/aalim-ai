  "transcript": "Hana's ha says is it ok for my mother to go to Hajj alone we are from the Philippines and it is her first time insha'Allah to perform Hajj this year she will be accompanied by a sheikh and together with friends now the issue of performing Hajj without a male Muharram there are difference of opinion among scholars the vast majority prohibit this but let us not look into the difference opinions of scholars let us go back to the Quran to the Sunna an authentic hadith the Prophet said is awesome it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Day of Judgment to travel without a male madam a statement so beautifully put by our prophet alayhi salatu salam now the Prophet said to travel maybe Hajj is included maybe it's not any type of travel is prohibited without a meal Muharram this is what the Prophet said that is a lot of Sarah ok then let us look at what happened after the Prophet said this a man stood up among the companions after hearing this instruction from the Prophet I am the prohibition of a woman travelling without a meal Muharram so he said o prophet of allah my know my name was selected to go on an expedition for jihad I'm going to fight in the cause of Allah with army so-and-so but my wife went for hedge so the guy is in a dilemma the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam said to him go and catch with your wife catch up with your wife which the scholars looked at the hadith and said you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand this the Prophet did not ask him at his awesome is your wife young or old the Prophet did not ask him to explain whether she was beautiful or ugly the Prophet Isis and did not ask him whether she was alone or with a trustworthy companionship like a sheikh or other friends and women the Prophet did not inquire which means that the ruling is for all go and catch up with your wife because if it was permissible to go alone or with trustworthy companion the Prophet would not have ordered him to leave jihad and go and accompany his wife so when you hear and read and learn this hadith and you learn of difference of opinions of other scholars you say to them with all due respect this is a hadith of the Prophet Alastair of Sarah they said yeah but Omar Baba may Allah be pleased with him sent the mothers of the believers the wives of the Prophet also serum to perform Hajj so every woman had her Muharram with her where does it say in the hadith that they did not have moms not only that so they've been zoom I may Allah be pleased with her she was among the mothers of the believers that would never have traveled out of Medina period they would say okay there's another hadith where the Prophet told us that there will come a time when a woman travels from a dent in her remote or to Sunnah in Yemen etc alone okay the Prophet is telling us about something that would happen in the future not that he's approving of it imagine that the Prophet when he tells us about the coming of the Dajjal is he approving of it and saying that this is a good thing or rather he's telling us about a prediction of something that Allah told him that would happen in the future so when you come with this clear evidence from the hadith of the Prophet Arizona to Salaam and you find that there are are different opinions of scholars you raise your hat to all the scholars and say with all due respect I only follow the Koran in the Sun especially if the Sunnah is crystal clear how dare I follow Tom Dick or Harry when the hadith is crystal clear I appreciate the rich tea had I appreciate what they had said but the majority majority followed the hadith of scholars and the hadith is crystal clear so I believe that this is not permissible for your mother to go"
