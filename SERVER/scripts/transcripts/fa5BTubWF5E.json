  "title": "Tests & Trials are for Humans & Jinn, so why does Allah decree distress for Animals?",
  "transcript": "I would need your help to understand something please um we know that Allah is our owner he is kind and merciful in that case just an observation that I would need verification on uh when we see animals that are in distress that are suffering whether it's due to something that those animals did on their own or because of human impacts on the animals for example a dog without legs or an animal stuck in some sort of situation and so on and requires external help we know that as far as I understand the test is for humankind and the gene kind why is it that the animals are going through this kind of difficult situations when the Hereafter as far as I understand is for humans and gentines did any of them complain to you something I was thinking about so I would I'm asking someone who is not eligible okay first of all uh Allah azzawajal and this is a given and I don't believe that anyone would doubt this that Allah is most merciful most compassionate that Allah azzawajal is wise and knowledgeable and that Allah azzawajal owns and possesses everything in this universe if these things are given then what you are talking about is overthinking and it's way above your pay grade and mine because I cannot come and judge Allah's actions when I don't have the full picture a young child who loves his father dearly and he's the only child of his father when he has abdominal pain and the surgeon says we have to cut him open and take his appendix out before it explodes when the father says to his son everything is going to be fine and the father is walking with his son and then the sun is placed on a stretcher and they change his clothes and they prepare him for the operation room and the Sun is terrified and the father says everything is going to be fine and when he's admitted to the operation room and they try to put things on his face and he sees the surgeon with wearing masks everybody's wearing masks and they're having knives ready to cut him open and the father says everything's going to be fine do you think that the child would believe no no everything is not going to be fine I can see that with my own eyes but the bigger picture is that everything is going to be fine here comes the trust Here Comes you being a servant of Allah because if you Cascade this you will go into thinking negatively of Allah why does Allah torture young children infants without legs infants who are Diabetic Type 1 infants that have to undergo six or seven surgeries before their one year of age what's the wisdom of that and then this may drive you to leave the fold of Islam let alone why are there volcanoes tornadoes earthquakes people die in tsunamis in the hundreds of thousands if not the millions pandemics Etc all of these are according to Allah's greater wisdom and knowledge and everything belongs to our life Allah would like would annihilate the holy of the universe and turn it into ashes as it was nothing before Allah created it from nothing and it can turn it back to nothing can anybody complain no so you have to know your limits and believe in Allah's mercy and wisdom and that everything is according to what Allah has planned and Allah Knows Best"
