  "transcript": "Sonia from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So I'm a new Muslim and I'm trying to learn about Islam and how to practice it. There's this course in my area, they said it's according to Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. I don't know what that means and I don't want to learn the wrong thing. Okay, first of all, may Allah Azza Wa Jal accept your Islam. May Allah Azza Wa Jal make you steadfast on this beautiful religion and may Allah increase your knowledge in Qur'an and the Sunnah according to the understanding of the three favourite generations. The terminology Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah is a terminology or a label that was introduced after the innovative or innovations increased and the deviant sects appeared in the beginning of Islam at the time of the late companions and the late tabi'een. So they needed to differentiate themselves from the Rafidah, Shia, so they called themselves Ahlus Sunnah because we're not associated or affiliated with this deviant sect. And al-Jamaah to indicate that the Prophet said ﷺ that the saved sect is the one who's with the Jamaah, with the congregation, with the vast majority of the Muslims. And when was asked, who are they? Define them so that we can realise them and detect them when we see them. The Prophet said ﷺ, those who are following what I and my companions are following, those who follow our footsteps. Now to come to this course you're talking about, unfortunately the terminology Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah nowadays has been used by even deviant sects to camouflage their innovations and bid'ah. Therefore I cannot vouch for them because I don't know who they are and what their practices are. And this means that you have to go to trusted scholars in your country or to those trusted students of knowledge who are actually on the right path and enquire from them whether this course is legit or not and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi'idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi'idhnillah."
