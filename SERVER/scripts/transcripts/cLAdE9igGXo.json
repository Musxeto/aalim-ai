  "title": "Should I order my Non Muslim maids to do proper hijab infront of my teenage boys",
  "transcript": "Ronna says should I order my non-muslim maids to do proper hijab at home as there are men in the house including my teenaged sons these maids may complain to human rights about this I had ordered a few of them before and they left the job well aji I am a little bit shocked you know what is right and what is wrong even if they wear the hijab their faces are still exposed how do you trust such men from looking at such non Muharram women and you have teenaged boys and this is a very critical and dangerous stage of life adding insult to injury you are saying that you're afraid of human rights which means that your country may legally prosecute you for this so what is the ruling I would advise you definitely to take out all such mates not to keep them home and if you have to keep maids in your home they have to be totally segregated from non muharram men meaning they have their own quarters that they would never come in contact with your sons or with your husband they are totally segregated and kept in their quarters in the kitchen far away from mixing otherwise what you're doing is totally prohibited and Allah knows best"
