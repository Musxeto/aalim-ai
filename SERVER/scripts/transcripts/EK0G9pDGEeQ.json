  "title": "Three types of answering Duaa | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "there are three types of answering dois and we've mentioned this so many times before so if I say oh Allah cure my illness Allah can cure my illness or Allah can deflect something equivalent to curing my illness so if curing my illness requires a thousand-euro there is another calamity that it was decreed upon me that would have cost me a thousand euros and Allah deflected it but I'm still making dua thinking that Allah is not responding to me no Allah responded but you did not know thirdly Allah so L may store this may store this for you on the day of judgement so all like you're my illness you're not cured and nothing was deflected away from you but when you come on the day of judgment you'll find a lot of good deeds and you say I didn't do this and you will be told that this is part of answering and responding to your drug"
