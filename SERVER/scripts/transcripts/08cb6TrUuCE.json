  "title": "Can I sing romantic songs that donâ€™t have shirk, kufr, or instruments? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Hayyan from Pakistan. Sheikh, as we know that music is haram, but if I'm singing a song and there is no music and there is no shirk and kufr, but there are some romantic lines and I'm alone singing it, would it be halal? I would say that this is similar to nasheed and if there is no profanity or vulgar language used and there isn't a possibility that shaitan will trick you to listen to the original, then inshallah there is nothing wrong in that. However it's best not to do it because if I were to hear you singing it, I would say how did you know that? You put yourself in trouble and you cast doubts upon yourself that oh, he listens to music, this is why he learned this song and now he's chanting it. But if there is no fear of such thing happening and shaitan will not come to you and say, listen, wow man, this song is great, I used to listen to it like a gazillion years ago, let me look and listen to the original with music just for old time's sake, then this becomes a haram thing to do and Allah knows best."
