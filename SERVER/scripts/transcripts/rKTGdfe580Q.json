  "title": "Bleeding after a miscarriage  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says it's been about 50 days since I had a late miscarriage I'm still bleeding when do I stop praying again the answer for this first portion of the question first of all we have to look at the miscarriage if a woman aborts or miscarriages her pregnancy like before 80 days then the blood that is coming out this is considered nothing it's not post natal bleeding and hence she should pray fast and offer Woodill the moment the Adhan is given and the blood is nyjah's but she does not refrain from fasting praying or even intercourse with her spouse if the pregnancy that was miscarriage a hundred and twenty days old or more this is definitely postnatal bleeding between 80 days and hundred and twenty days we have to look at the fetus that came out if it had the features of a human being arms legs and a head then it is postnatal bleeding if it's only pieces of flesh and meat then this is blood that is not part of the postnatal bleeding and she has to fast pray and and the rest of that what about if it's postnatal bleeding if it's postnatal bleeding then the max for it is 40 days if she becomes pure before that she has to perform muscle and pray but if the blood comes back again within the forty days period she has to refrain and consider that to be postnatal bleeding and so on once the fourth 40th day is due she performs Russell even if the blood is coming out this becomes a blood that is facet that is is not part of the post little bleeding the second part of the question says I started to pray after 40 days now this is subjective - whether it is postnatal bleeding or not I went in hospital today and they said I still have some placenta left inside they have to operate to remove it they said I'll be bleeding for few more weeks how should I pray and when do I stop what if I start my menses while I'm bleeding in this case she is to be treated as a mastaba and the blood that is coming out is considered to be st hala because it's continuously a woman cannot have her menses more than half of the month so 15 days is the max if it continues she has to perform whistle and pray and consider that bleeding to be them facade then one facet which is not part of her menses or postnatal bleeding but it is just like a wound now if she does this operation the doctors would most likely tell her that this is not your menses and that this is a bleeding due to the operation and hence she has to pray her five daily prayers performing will do after each event not before the event and she's considered to be most AHA Baba and this is called st hava when the blood is continuous and it's not her menses what happens if she does get her menses through these weeks of bleeding in this case her menses would be recognized by certain characteristics the change of color and smell of the blood the back and stomach aches and she knows her usually time of the month where she gets her menses then she should consider this to be part of her menses the the specific six or seven days and and she continues to be following the rules of Asti haba as before"
