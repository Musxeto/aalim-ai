  "transcript": "Zan from Kashmir actually I had already asked you this question through email and you had replied to me the question was actually regarding the couple who haven't met in 3 years but the wife gave birth to the child so you said that they both have to take Oath by Allah's name four times if the man if the man says that the boy is not mine but the uh question here is what if they both take the Oath by Allah's name and they both say that like woman says that this is the father and the man denies it so what would be the conditions in this case the Muslim judge would separate between them and the boy would be attributed to his mother and not given the name of the father and this is known as Al Al mentioned in the beginning ofah n the Surah of light this is a translation of N and it states clearly that if a man accuses his wife of adultery and he does not bring four male Witnesses testifying to his side in this case because it's his honor his name he has to go through the process of Le by swearing by Allah four times that she committed adultery I swear by Allah she committed adultery and the fifth time he said I swear by Allah she committed adult adultery and may the curse of Allah fall upon me if I was telling a lie and in her defense she says I swear by Allah I did not commit adultery four times and then she says I swear by Allah I did not commit adultery and May the uh curse of Allah be up May the wrath of Allah be upon me if he was telling the truth in this case it's his word against uh uh hers and the Muslim judge judges only through evidence and this is where he separates them and they can never get married or be together again and Allah Knows Best"
