  "title": "Is discussing authority figures' misconduct considered to be backbiting? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. If someone, some people in your community are with authority and they do bad things and everyone knows them but they normally deny that they don't do anything wrong but we know they do wrong. Can we discuss among ourselves is this considered backbiting? It depends if this discussion would lead to changing what is evil and good would replace it then this is fine providing that you have evidence that is backed up by proof that can stand in a court of law. Most allegations are baseless or can't be proven. You have to have proof. You saw. It's not enough that, valid. If it stands in a court of law all of you would be flogged for slandering such a person, an individual. You have to bring witnesses. You have to see it with your own eyes and it has to thin air, accuse people and discuss it, there's no benefit or point of that and that would be haram and Allah knows best."
