  "transcript": "Imran from Austria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my friend got married about two months ago, and they still don't live together And he was preparing his apartment his car and during that the wife of the mother of the wife got cancer Um, now the wife says I cannot move in with you because I am the only one who can take care of my mother My friend says no you move in with me and your mother moves in with me So we live together so you can look after your mother And the wife says no because my mother doesn't want to live with you. So I cannot move in with you Um, what should my friend do? He has the right to Ask Her if she's unable to come and move in with him that he goes and moves with them And pay them something of rent or something of that sort and if this is also unacceptable to him This is not a charity organization He got married to fulfill his needs and to have a family and she On the other hand if there's no one at all to take care of her mother It becomes an obligation upon her To do so so There is no common ground Either he moves in with her and live with her mother to live a married life Or if he can wait And he finds it in him possible to wait And he has the ability to wait Then that's fine. If not divorce her or ask her to take khala and return the mahar because it's her fault And he goes and marries another one"
