  "transcript": "uh question number two are the deceased informed when we give s or on their behalf this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that deceased are in their bar state of life which is between Dunya the life we live in and the Hereafter so it's in between and therefore they the most authentic opinion is that they do not know what is happening so when people visit their graves and we see some of them talking oh Abdullah don't you know uh our neighbor moved out and by the way uh your cousin is getting married next week make Dua for him wait what are you doing said I'm talking to my deceased friend or relative he doesn't hear you you can't talk to the dead this is not permissible so yes they don't know who they visit them the most authentic opinion and what they say to them and what they had done uh for them such as Dua or ha or or charity and Allah Knows Best"
