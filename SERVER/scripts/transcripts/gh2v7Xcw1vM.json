  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ  admonishment of Usama for not standing for the truth assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Similar again, and he was admonished again. A woman from the tribe of Mahzum, a dignitary, a highly reputable tribe, she used to steal things from people and never return them back, like borrowing utensils and never giving it back, saying that it's mine. So when they complained to the Prophet ﷺ, the Prophet ruled that she has to face the punishment for stealing things and that is to cut her hand off. So the people of the woman went to Usama because they know that he's close and beloved to the Prophet ﷺ, complained, and asked him to intercede. So Usama, a young boy, went to the Prophet and said, O Prophet of Allah, if you can have some leniency on the woman, her family came to me and the Prophet ﷺ was outraged, saying to Usama, do you intercede in one of Allah's prescribed punishment? Do you intercede? Then he made a public speech to teach the people the gravity of such an act. And he praised Allah and he offered salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ and then said to the people, beware, those before you were destroyed and annihilated when their dignitaries stole and they let them go. While when the poor stole, they used to chop their hands. So it must be known to all, there is no intercession in the prescribed punishment once it's finalised. And this is to indicate the importance of prescribed punishment for the security and the safety of the community."
