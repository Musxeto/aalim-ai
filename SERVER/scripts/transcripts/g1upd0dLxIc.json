  "title": "A night to gather in the village to read Quran once a year & offer sacrifice, is this from the Sunna",
  "transcript": "The third question is that I think once in a year, it's not a Mawlana B or it's not about year, we call this Gamu. Once in a year, the village, all the people in that village will gather together to read the Quran and they spend the day and the night to pray or the, you know, people from different places to gather together and they kill a lot of cows and stuff. They say this is another way to, you know, people gather together and they say it's a form of worship. And I think this is not about the dead part of the Prophet but this is something once in a year, all the people in the village will go there and read Quran, recite Quran and maybe at night, they do the some of the Dawa. Is it permissible in Islam? These three questions, I want to know the ruling of them in Islam. And I am a very big fan of you, Sheikh. I follow you a lot and I want you to remember me in your prayers as well. I love you for the sake of Allah. Barakallah Fika Khair, Uzzakallah Khair. May Allah Azza wa Jal make you steadfast upon the Sunnah of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wasallam and combine and join you and me with the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wasallam in Jannatul Naeem and all our viewers bi-idhnillah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala. And finally, the last question. There is a night where we gather in the village and we spend the night reading the Quran, making Dua, offering sacrifice, feasting, etc. I don't know what that night is but definitely the whole thing is not from Islam. Maybe you are going to say this is the miraculous night journey which is on the 27th of Rajab. Maybe you are going to say this is on the 15th of Sha'ban which is Laylatul Mubarakah, etc. Maybe you are going to say this is here or there. Either way, in our religion, we do not have such a day where people gather in congregation and do what they are doing as you have claimed because this is an innovation Allah knows best. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah. Al Fatiha."
