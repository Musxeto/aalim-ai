  "transcript": "What are some non-emphatic sunnah prayers and other prayers? BarakAllahu Fiikum. And finally, what are some of the unemphatic sunnah to be prayed? First of all, whatever is between Adhan and Niqama. So between every Adhan and Niqama there are two rak'ahs. Also the four rak'ah before Asr prayer. May Allah have mercy upon anyone who prays four rak'ahs before Asr. Also an extra two rak'ahs after Dhuhr. So we know that there are four before Dhuhr, two after Dhuhr emphatic. When you add another two, this is some of the non-emphatic sunnah that you can offer among others and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
