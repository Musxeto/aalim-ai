  "transcript": "Ibrahima from Guinea. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. May Allah bless you and reward you and your family. And you as well. My question today is regarding the fact that I have two people working under me who are keepers and at the same time workers in my agricultural field. But the problem is one day I went there and I saw cigarettes inside the field so I completely forbid them to have cigarettes. Whoever wants to smoke he will have to smoke outside of the field. When it comes to music I'm wondering if I have the duty or the responsibility to tell them not to listen to it. They stay there all day and all night. So I mean I don't know if I have the power to tell someone not to listen to music all day and all night. Even though I'm not his father basically. But since they are working in my field I don't want to have any kind of sin because of it. So this is my question. Do they grow their beards? One is a Muslim the other one is not a Muslim. So do you ask the non-Muslim to convert to Islam? I'm planning to do that to him but we didn't reach that point yet. Okay the Muslim do you ask him to grow his beard? No. So why is that? Again you're not his father. You don't have authority over workers that work under you unless they're abusing the facilities to their sin. What they do on their own whether they smoke or listen to music. As long as they're not using your plot and facility for their sin. This is between them and Allah. You just simply ask them please try not to listen to music or smoke. And if you want to smoke you go out of the plot and smoke there. Which is not logical because they're going to stay all day long there and not work. So you just advise them give them da'wah and move on and Allah knows best."
