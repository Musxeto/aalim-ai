  "transcript": "is it permissible to um buy products from amazon if it's written not returnable okay i will answer inshallah faizan from india says some products we buy from amazon is not refundable we cannot return them back so is this halal it is haram on them because if there is a def uh a defect in it then it's my right in islam to return it and get back my money but some things you may buy worldwide and they refuse to return it and they have the right not to do so such as underwears for example you cannot buy an underwear take it home and then the following day return it this is totally unacceptable everywhere to my knowledge and in some cases the product itself must be investigated the moment it's shipped to you so if you receive it with the agent with you you demand that he inspects it with you to see that there is no fault or defect in it and then you accept it and allah azza knows best"
