  "transcript": "afrina says what is ruling on a religious girl when she has a proposal when the groom wants to settle in the u.s she is scared that she wouldn't hear the advan which is very depressing to her what is the religious guideline to for her this is up to her own preference and it depends on her status whether there are other proposals coming to pick from or not depending on her age depending her and depending on her religious commitment some people are extremely practicing here in saudi arabia once they go to canada or to europe or to the us they start compromising their religion and their practice and they become unfortunately heedless so it all depends what is your advice here my advice don't go there don't accept such a proposal i've been to these countries before i've seen the muslims and how they suffer with their children i've seen the second and the third generation of muslim immigrants who went there and how their religion was severely compromised i've seen women girls running away with their christian boyfriends and their parents coming in weeping what should we do what can we do we provided her with everything we bought a house we have a beautiful car and we have good income yes but you don't have islam so those living there may allah make it easier for me but when you have the choice if i have the choice people coming to me and say we will give you 50 million dollars to migrate would you never leave the land of islam to migrate yeah i may go for a few months to work or to study or to teach but never to get married there never to raise my children there never to settle there because the prophet hassam ordered us to migrate to a muslim land so that we would preserve a religion not to compromise our religion in such a fashion but again this is your choice at the end of the day"
