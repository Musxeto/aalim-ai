  "transcript": "For the Prophet ï·º, you give yourself wholeheartedly to the Sunnah in every single thing. Even in clipping your nails, which is a trivial thing. I was in Indonesia, I was in Malaysia, and I'm shocked with boys having this nail long. What is this? Men! I said, where is the manicure? Nail polish? Where is it? He said, Sheikh, I'm offended. I said, I'm offended. Why aren't you following the Sunnah? Why is this nail? Is it for purposes? Ya'ni, purposes? To know I need to cut things, you know, I get rappers, cut things. He said, buy a pocket knife. What is this? So, you follow the Sunnah? 100%."
