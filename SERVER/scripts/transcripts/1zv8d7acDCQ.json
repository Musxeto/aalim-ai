  "title": "Mistake in Tashahhud Seen ุณ and Saad ุต, are my previous prayers valid",
  "transcript": "My question is, I forgot that in Tashahud there is Saad in As-Salawatu and Saliheen, but I pronounced it as Seen. Are my previous prayers valid? Jazakallahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum. Yes, your prayers are valid because the utterance of Salah, Salah is almost the same. It doesn't change the meaning and people know that this is an accident and not intentional so it is valid In Sha Allah. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it In Sha Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
