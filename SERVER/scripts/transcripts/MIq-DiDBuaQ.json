  "transcript": "Sidra says when is the last time to pray Mallory in terms of time because it is impossible to look at the redness in the sky when we or when you are living in the city kindly tell an approximate time so syndra wants me to say that after sunset you have 70 minutes of Maghreb and the seventy-first moment after sunset this is raesha time syndra I'm afraid that this is not possible because prayer times are based on the location of the Sun whether it is the break of dawn whether it has passed the area of the meridian or the the zenith when it goes a little bit to the west whether it is Midway where the erected objects shade to the east is equivalent to its length and this is a sir time whether the Sun had set this is mother of time and whether the redness in the horizon has disappeared and this is the time when Asia begins up till the middle of the night now how is it possible to fix a time for that when we have different seasons we know that the length of the day and the length of the night differ in the winter and the summer so in summer we have a very long day and a short night in winter we have the opposite a very long night and a very short daytime so you cannot fix this you cannot say I'd like to know how much exactly is it between the hora nozzle like two hours one hour and a half three hours you cannot tell that because seasons differ and countries differ as well so even if summer in Saudi Arabia the longest of the day would be like 15 16 hours maybe 17 hours if you go to the UK or some parts of Europe it may extend to 20 hours or 19 and a half or 21 hours so it differs according to the season and according to the location of your country now having said that the most reliable calendar or timetable that you can work with is amol aura calculations and this goes for fajar for answer and Maghreb that is sunset AirAsia is not accurate because it is fixed throughout the year to one and a half hours after sunset and this is not true and it's not practical and it differs so our Asia timing is definitely off in Amara timetable how long is it between mother even Asia average in normal countries would be 50 minutes to 70 minutes it does not reach an hour and a half some countries the redness which is coming after the Sun had set in the direction of the West disappears totally after 50 minutes 55 minutes and it sometimes it goes up to an hour and 10 minutes but it does not usually exceed that so if you are able to do that at home do it if not then how it fixed at one-and-a-half hour just to be safe entry after that insha'Allah you"
