  "title": "Ep 3 - Abu Talib's care for him | Seerah of the Prophet ﷺ | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem (Translated)",
  "transcript": "Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen Wa Salatu Wasalamu Ala Al-Mab'uthi Rahmatan Lil'Alamin Nabina Muhammadin Wa Ala Alihi Wa Sahbihi Ajma'een Amma Ba'd As-Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh In the previous lesson, we stopped at the death of the father of the Prophet ﷺ, his mother, grandfather and the care of his uncle Abu Talib. Abu Talib, the uncle of the Prophet ﷺ, took care of him for 40 years, defending him, advocating for him, (keeping away) Quraish and giving his life to his brother's son. Abu Talib was a poor man with children, so he took his brother's son to his children and treated him better than his own children. To the point where the Prophet ﷺ even wanted to pay back some of the debt by taking care of the sheep. As it is mentioned in Sahih that the Prophet ﷺ said, There is no prophet but he took care of the sheep. They said, even you, O Messenger of Allah? He said, even I took care of the sheep for the children of such and such (in exchange) for Qarareet. He wanted to help his uncle in costs and expenses, so he took care of the sheep ﷺ . When Khadija got married, and we will talk about that later In Sha Allah, he helped his uncle by taking Ali from him, may Allah be pleased with him and please him, who was a child, to be raised in the house of prophethood. And to be raised with his uncle's son, may Allah's prayers and peace be upon him and his family, who took care of him and took care of him until he became who he became, may Allah be pleased with him and please him. Abu Talib was poor and the Prophet ﷺ took care of the sheep. But why is it, There is no prophet but he took care of the sheep? Why is this commonality between all the prophets? The scholars said, perhaps in this, it is a lesson for the prophets for public leadership and policy. Because the one who does not practice leading people and dealing with their good and evil, perhaps he came with disasters. If the people were led by one who has no experience in dealing with them, nor in knowing the interests & benefits from the corrupt & evil, this leads to the corruption of the nation. The Prophet ﷺ said to the one who asked him, O Messenger of Allah, when is the appointed time? He said, If the trust is lost, then wait for the appointed time. The man said, What causes it to be lost? He said If the matter (leadership and religion) is appointed to other than its people, then wait for the time. The leadership and public policy is a great matter. The Prophet ﷺ said in the authentic hadith that pride and arrogance is in the people of camels and horses, who raise camels and horses, you will find pride in them. As it is said in general, the pride of the soul, because it takes from the morals of those animals. The camel raises its nose in pride and arrogance, and so is the horse. He ﷺ said, And the tranquility is in the shepherds of the sheep. Those who make a take care of the sheep, you will find tranquility in them, you will find goodness in them, you will find calm in them, because they take from the morals of those animals, including tranquility and calmness. The Prophets also used to take care of the sheep, because they learn to be kind to their sick and help the weak. and such that exists in everyone who makes a takes care of sheep and raises them. In addition to that, the best thing a man eats from it what his hand earned Dawood used to eat from what his hands earned, as it was said in the authentic hadith. The Prophets, when they take care of the sheep, they eat  The story of the care of the sheep for Moses ﷺ is known and mentioned for ten years. Abu Talib loved his brother's son with great love, but this love does not overrule the original rules of Sharia. So it was transmitted from Al-Abbas the uncle of the Prophet ﷺ and may Allah be pleased with Al-Abbas, that he asked the Prophet ﷺ, Did you see Abu Talib, who was helping you and taking care of you, did you benefit him in any way? The Prophet ﷺ said, in the meaning of the hadith, that he was in a state of fire. If it were not for me, he would have been in the lowest rank of fire. In some narrations, it is said that Abu Talib was the least of people in punishment. A firewood is placed in his shoe and his brain boils from the heat of it. May Allah protect us and you. Abu Talib, who the Prophet ﷺ tried to invite him to Islam and make him speak the truth to the end of his life, and was saddened by his death, but the bad companions prevented him from doing so. The Prophet ﷺ used to say to him while he was on the deathbed, O uncle, say a word that I will intercede for you with my Lord, say, there is no god but Allah. He was hesitant and hesitant to say this great word, and Abu Jahl and another man at his head said, Do you leave the religion of Abdul Muttalib? Do you leave the religion of your fathers and grandfathers? Until they convinced him not to say it, and he said about himself, he is on the religion of Abdul Muttalib and he died on that. we ask Allah for us and you a good end for actions are judged by their outcomes What did he gain by taking care of his brother's 40-year-old son? Abu Talib, out of his love for his brother's son, used to accompany him everywhere and be afraid  him. The story of Bahira al-Rahib came in the Seerah. The Prophet ﷺ took his uncle with him on a trip to Sham when he was 12 years old. He even reached Basra. Many people think that Basra is in Iraq, and it is not that city. It is Busra, which is known to the Arabs and is old and has its heritage and history. It is mentioned in the hadiths of the Prophet ﷺ that the fire that comes out of the city lights the necks of camels in Basra. It is the incident that happened in the year 106 approximately. Imam al-Nawawi and other historians wrote that it came out of the city and lit the necks of camels in Basra. This city is different from Basra in Iraq. The Prophet ﷺ went with his uncle and when they reached that city, written in the books of the biography that a monk named Bahira, who was in his home, did not go out to those who passed by him, nor did he speak to them. People know that when he was traveling in the desert, in the wilderness, he needed to go to a place, a house, a palace, to have a guest come down to him and ask for his permission and to rest. People did that out of generosity. This is from ancient times. The Prophet ﷺ said, \"...If one believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him honor his guest.\" Look at the state of Ibrahim. Thousands of years ago, when he was lighting the fire and honoring his guest, did you hear the story of Ibrahim's honored guest? Foreign guests came to him and said, \"...Peace.\" He said, \"...Peace.\" He was the most honored and the best in greeting. group of unknown people. Look at the Faa, it shows immediately following and the Fawriyah. He went to his family and brought a fat calf. They did not have a microwave or an oven. This is proof that the fat calf was cooked and ready to welcome the guests. He brought it closer to them. He did not say, \"...Come and eat.\" He brought it closer to them. He said, \"...Do you not eat with curiosity, love and affection?\" This is the state of generosity. This is the state of the perfect people. They welcome the guests and honor them. They even give them what they (the hosts) need. Even if they have special needs, as in the description of the Ansar. Glory be to Allah, in that group, the situation changed. Bahira who did not open the door and did not speak to anyone, opened his door and invited the guests to enter. They left their belongings and the Prophet, peace be upon him, was taking care of their belongings. They entered. When they entered, he said, \"...Did you all come?\" They said, \"...Yes.\" he said, \"...Did you not leave anyone\" they said, \"...Did you leave an orphan?\" with our belongings, he said, \"...Bring him.\" They brought him. and he looked at him and said, \"...This is the Prophet of his time.\" The reason is that he said, \"...When you came, I saw a cloud that shaded him and went wherever he went. When you came to my house, I saw the cloud as it was. and When you brought him, the cloud came and shaded the whole place, and I knew it was him. On his back, they sealed the Prophet, like a pigeon egg, in its size.\" This story is famous in the books of the seerah. In fact, this story is found in almost all the books of the Sira. Abu Talib ordered that he should bring back his brother's son, because if the Jews and Christians heard of him, they would kill him and harm him, because they knew that he was the Prophet of his time, peace be upon him. This story is famous. Should we study it or ignore it? The principle in the stories of the seerah is that people are in ease about it a lot. and In its narration, as long as it does not mention a jurisprudence, or a religious matter, or a matter that goes against this religion. Otherwise, the principle is that the seerah contains many weak and perhaps abandoned (due to weakness) narrations. There is a break, and after that, In Sha Allah, we will continue the discussion on this issue. Stay tuned. Peace be upon you. The story of the monk Bahira. Many narrators have rejected it. Imam Al-Dhahabi rejected it and spoke about it in detail. In its content and in its chain of narrators. What does it mean in content and in chain? The science of Hadith is composed of a chain. It is the chain of men who transmitted the Hadith, the Hadith of the Prophet, peace be upon him, from the companions, from the followers, and so on, to the end. With a chain that is connected, without any weakness or hidden issues, which is narrated by the firm trustworthy narrator from his like. This is the chain of the narrators, in which there is nothing like it in any religion in the world. Only the Islamic religion is able to give a ruling... ...about any narration from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that has been narrated or transmitted to us about him with this detailed and precise study of the states of the men who narrated the Hadith. Whoever has weakness, or hidden defect/issue, or abnormality (in narration) or negligence, this Hadith is not accepted. Because Allah Almighty has preserved this religion. And from the preservation of this religion is the preservation of the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him. and by preserving the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him, he has restricted to this noble science, men who know the correct from the wrong. And they can distinguish the Hadith from the Hadith that is spread among people. Then there is the text, which is the content of the Hadith. If we have a text like the one we have, the story of Bahira, in which the Prophet is 12 years old, and in which Abu Bakr was with him. Abu Bakr was 10 years old or less. while their companionship was not developed until many years later. The more astonishing is that in the story, Bilal was with them. And Bilal was not born at that time. May Allah be pleased with him and please him. Bilal was not born, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, was 12 years old. So this indicates the negligence of the text. As for the chain, the chain is weak. there hasn't been a chain with even the slightest sign of acceptance except that which is in the Sunnan of Imam Al-Tirmidhi and the chain contains what it contains of weakness, issues, and abnormality. So, should we narrate this story or not? I think, and Allah knows best, that a person should go through it, and take what is in it, and not believe that it happened. Because if it happened, and Abu Talib returned with his nephew, fearing that the Jews and Christians would attack him, as Bahira advised, then I have a problem. And the problem is that the Prophet, peace be upon him, after he reached, and became in his twenties, we know for sure that he went with Khadija's property for trade before marrying her, and he was working with her, and he was going to Levant for trade. If this story, the story of Bahira, happened, Abu Talib would not have allowed his son to go to Sham, and he was warned by Bahira, and he returned on that day. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, would not have gone at all, and he would not have known that he was the Prophet of this Ummah, after Bahira had spoken. And he would have prepared to receive the Prophethood from Gabriel, peace be upon him, when he came to him in the cave of Hira, and he told him to read. He was not afraid, peace be upon him, he said, yes, I have been waiting for you for a long time. So, the story is like a story that is narrated in the books of the biography, but we cannot be sure of its authenticity, even if the heart is inclined to the lack of its authenticity. Then, as you know, we have overcome many of the important incidents that happened before his prophethood, peace be upon him. The reason is that this is a simple lesson about the Seerah. Expansion will come, In Sha Allah, in advanced stages, but we are trying to be as comprehensive as possible, and as quickly as possible, and in the easiest of expressions, if our Lord allows. In the life of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and before his prophethood, there was a covenant called the Covenant of Fud'ool. This union was originally from a man from Zubayd, he was a Zubaydi, he came to Mecca with his merchandise, and Al-Aas Ibn Wail bought it from him, that infidel from the worst of the polytheist of Quraysh. He was stealing people's money and eating it illegally, hiding behind his lineage, strength, and clan. He bought the merchandise from him, then he withheld its price from him. Of course, this man came in the season, and he wanted provision from Allah Almighty, and they were pilgrimaging and selling, and this continues to our current age, so you have no sin to seek a favor from your Lord, as it was mentioned in Surah Al-Baqarah. It is not a shame for a Muslim to perform pilgrimage and work in trade, for this is a matter that Allah Almighty has given to Muslims. And so it was with the polytheists. But this infidel, and he has a share in his name, he rejected the man and kept his right. So this poor man went and the allies of Al-Aas had enmity towards the man, Ad-Dar, Makhzooman, Jumah, Sahman, and Adi Ibn Ka'ab, went to all the tribes in Quraysh, and no one looked at him, and he did not weigh for him, but they rejected and scolded him. \"Are you not ashamed, fear Allah! this is a master of the leaders of Quraysh, you want your money from him?\", go away. Glory be to Allah, eating the people's money in falsehood, and they help him with that. So when the man found that he had no help, he waited until the next morning, and he climbed the mountain, and he cried when the sun rose, and he read the verses in the books of the biography, and he said, O people of Fahr, for a oppressed in his merchandise by the belly of Makkah, away from his house and his Allies I am a distant person, I am singing for a oppressed in his merchandise, I mean, I sing it, I want it. He said, and a man in a pilgrim, tired, who has not yet completed his pilgrim, O look the men, between the rukn and the hijri. I mean, where are those who help the weak and the suffering? It is sacred for he whose merchandise is in the belly of Makkah, and it is not sacred for garments of the wicked, the deceiving. The garment of the wicked, the decieving, this is the one who eats people's money and betrays trust. So Zubair bin Abdul Muttalib said, by Allah, this man shall not be left to suffer Honor had risen up in them, they have been brazen. These Arabs are polytheists, these Arabs they have what they have (of evil), but glory be to a Allah At that time, they were the best of creation, despite their disbelief and polytheism. Therefore, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, I was sent to perfect the good morals. I was sent to perfect the good morals, meaning that I was sent, and the Arabs have of morals what they have, But from the completion of what I was sent to do is perfect the noble morals. If we compare the morals of the Arabs and Muslims in our days, and the morals of the polytheists, at that time we would find a great difference. Unfortunately, if you look around you, you will not find anyone but those who belong to Islam. They are called Muslims, but you do not find Islam. You do not find honesty, you do not find trust, you do not find generosity, you do not find courage, you do not find enthusiasm, you do not find forgiveness. Great morals that existed in us, disappeared in abundance due to the abundance of materialism. And people's concern became, this life, but they love the life of this world and the hereafter is better and everlasting Glory be to Allah. The man among us, if he saw someone who was favored in provision, he envied him, but they affect the life of this world. And if the Fajr prayer had passed him for days, weeks, and months in a row, this would not have shaken his hair in his body. This is evidence of the great error that exists in us. I was only sent to perfect the good of morals. On their polytheism and disbelief, Zubair bin Abdul Muttalib said, By Allah, this man will not be left to suffer There is no hope, there is nothing we can do. So the tribes gathered, and they all gathered, to help the weak, to bring his rights to him, and to help the oppressed over his oppressors. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, and the Hadith narrated by Al-Bayhaqi and Sahih Al-Albani, by Talha bin Abdullah bin Auf, that the Messenger, peace be upon him, said, I have witnessed in the house of Abdullah bin Jad'an, a covenant that I would not like to exchange it for red camels And if I were called to it in Islam, I would have responded. Or as he said, peace be upon him, Abdullah bin Jad'an was one of the most honorable of Quraish, and one of their nobles, and one of their nobles. And he, if you do not my memory is correct, whose mention came in the Hadith of our mother Aisha. When she said, O Messenger of God, have you seen Abdullah bin Jad'an? He was feeding the hungry, and relieving the poor and the captives, and feeding the needy and the afflicted. He said, peace be upon him, O Aisha, that does not benefit him while he is in the fire, because he did not say that day, Lord forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense. Glory be to Allah. Where did the correct measurement go among people? The principle in the Muslim is that he looks at things from the perspective of Sharia. You find now the man praising the other, as he came in the Hadith, in Sahih Muslim, in the Hadith of the lifting of the trust , he said, they say, how brave he is, how charming he is, and there is not in his heart the weight of an ant of belief, or as he said peace be upon him said. People now evaluate others on worldly deeds, and they are unaware that these deeds have no weight, if the heart is devoid of faith. You find those who praise the polytheists, you find those who look at something of pride and glory, and something of appreciation and glorification of the infidel. He said, my brother, this is a good person, this is a generous person, this is a creative person, this is a noble person, but he is an infidel. He makes with Allah another god, he makes for Allah a son. He said, my brother, this is his religion. These are their matters with Allah, Glory be to Allah. You also refuse to admit that this is an infidel. And so it came in some aspects of Islam that whoever does not disbelieve the infidel, or doubts his disbelief, this is a contradiction of the aspects of religion. Those who said that Allah is the third of three disbelieved. Allah, Almighty, has judged them by disbelief. You say, my brother, do not say that the Christians are infidels, these are the people of the book. He is the people of the book and an infidel. But people have a flaw in matters of creed, they have a flaw in matters of evaluation. You find people judging others on worldly measures. So these tribes came and allied. What did they ally on? This, In Sha Allah, we will not know after the break, so stay with us. Peace be upon you. The alliance of curiosity, as it was mentioned, that four or five or six of the tribes of Quraysh made a covenant on the victory of the oppressed. So they went to the house of Al-Aas bin Wael. And they still have it until they took out from him the merchandise of that Zubaidi. And they returned it to him. Then it is narrated, after their covenant on the victory of the oppressed, that a woman from the tribe of Abd Al-Dar or from the tribe of Abd Al-Manaf brought them a cloth in which there was a thread and it said Zamzam in it. So they dipped their hands in it and made a covenant on the victory of the oppressed. And it was said that they wiped and cleaned the Kaaba with it, glorifying this alliance. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said that if he was invited to an alliance like his, he would have answered. And this also contains a lesson, that many of those who are takfiri, those who are ignorant, those who are in a hurry to impose takfiri rulings on people, deny that Muslims should enter into an alliance with the infidels to defend the accepted values, to defend the oppressed, etc. So he says that anyone who enters into an alliance with the infidels, or in a covenant, or in anything of this tribe, is an outcast, an infidel, whose blood and money are permissible to take etc. I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. If you looked around you, you would find that these takfiri, or outcasts, did not leave anyone but disbelieved him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said that if he was invited to an alliance like his in Islam, he would have answered. What do you understand from what the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said? And the alliance of Al-Mutayabeen is the alliance of Al-Fudhool. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not enter into any alliance except one. The people of the biography spoke and said that they are two different alliances, but it is true that they are one alliance. This hastiness in imposing the rulings, only results from ignorance. This ignorance is the result of that great ignorance, which when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was in the midst of giving out the bounty of war one of the companions from Yemen came with gold, and he distributed it. That ignorant man said, He said this great saying to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, who was angry and said, Woe to you! Who is just if I am not just? And I am trustworthy to whoever is in the heavens and on the earth. So those who cast the blame, left and right, no, and after that they make divisions. They say whoever made this treaty is a disbeliever, and whoever supported him is a disbeliever, and the ministers are disbelievers, and their assistants are like that, and the guards, the police, and the army, who are defended by disbelievers, and their children and their wives are disbelievers, and they are pleased with this disbelief. There is no one left. And so you see the groups of takfir and hijrah, as it appeared in Egypt and other countries, and what we see now from Dagaish, and from Dagaish, the non-Islamic state in Iraq and the Levant, they call themselves the Islamic state, and they are not from Islam at all. And it is not permissible to attribute them to Islam. When you say the Islamic state, you mean that the Islamic state is responsible for the bombing, killing, terrorism, and terrorizing. And Islam is free of that, as the Islamic Republic of Iran says. Islam is not related to that, and it is not permissible to call it an Islamic republic. So there must be a return. Did the Messenger of Allah make such treaties? Yes, he did. In fact, the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, in the Battle of Hudaybiyah, as will come, In Sha Allah, made great treaties, but his action, peace be upon him, is a proof that it is from the Shari'ah. So the polytheists made a treaty that if any of you came to us as Muslims, we would return it to you. And if any of you Muslims came to you who rejected his religion, And they made peace with the treaty of Hudnah. And it was said that it was open, and it is true that the treaty of Hudnah between Muslims and polytheists must be determined, and there is a difference between the jurists. So we see that it is not permissible for a Muslim to speak without knowledge and to pass the matter as he wants and to remove from religion whoever he wants. So our Lord, Almighty, said, So ask the people of the Remembrance, if you do not know, in two parts of his book. But to ask the unknown, to ask the ignorant. Who said it? He said, a student of the student of knowledge said, What is his name? He said, his name is Abu al-Darda al-Libi. He said, where do we know him? And who else? He said, as well as Abu Ikrimah al-Iraqi said, and Abu Hudhaifa al-Shami said, there are people we do not know. Do they know their origin, their class, and their knowledge from whom they took this knowledge, at the hand of those who studied? They do not know. They are unknown, and we are ignorant of their situation. Therefore, from the biography of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, we seek knowledge and we behave with the etiquette of Islam. And we know who is the one who speaks without knowledge and does what he does not know from those who have that knowledge. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in his birth, he did not come into being as the majority of the youth and the children. As Allah, Almighty, who raised him, Allah, Almighty, who protected him, and Allah protects you from people, Allah, Almighty, protected him and raised him. In the best way. My Lord has taught me, so my etiquette is better. And this hadith is in view, but it is correct in terms of meaning. And our mother Aisha was asked about his character, peace and blessings be upon him, and she said, O my son, do you not read the Qur'an? His character was the Qur'an, that is, he used to do what was in it. The Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, before the revelation and before the revelation of the Qur'an to him, was one of those whom Allah Almighty raised. Allah Almighty created him on the nobility of morals and on the good of them. He protected him from all evil. It was not known about him, peace and blessings be upon him, one lie. He was known among the polytheists, among the people of Quraysh, as the trustworthy, the truthful, the trustworthy. And this was before the revelation. And they used to trust him, peace and blessings be upon him, with their possessions and their money. Even after the revelation. When he wanted to emigrate, he did not emigrate, peace and blessings be upon him, until he was sure that Ali would return the money to its owners. Meaning that the polytheists were putting their money with him, and they fought him and fought him and mocked his morals and intellect. Why? Because they, and if they disobeyed him in religion, they do not disobey him in that he is truthful, trustworthy, peace and blessings be upon him. Allah Almighty protected him from all evil, even from lying. He did not drink alcohol at all. He did not prostrate to a single person, peace and blessings be upon him. Even though this was a custom among his people. Imagine, you are among thousands of your people, you are sick and in need, and yet you do not go to their gods and pray to them. Because your nature is pure and pure, Allah Almighty protected it. Or the original is that if a person is sick and in need, he goes and prostrates to the gods and prays to them. Because this is what all people do, except the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. And a group of those who were on the Hanafi religion, like Amr bin Zayd bin Nufayl, the father of Zayd bin Amr bin Nufayl. Zayd bin Amr bin Nufayl was one of the monotheists, and it was mentioned in the hadith that he will be sent as a nation/role-model. He did not eat what was slaughtered on the cross. And he said, Glory be to Allah, Allah creates it, feeds it, and gives it to drink, and you slaughter it for others. So this Zayd bin Amr bin Nufayl, who was the uncle of Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him and please him, was one of the monotheists. But he did not realize the message of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. And the Messenger saw him not eating what was slaughtered on the cross. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, never ate what was slaughtered on the cross. And he did not attend a celebration of the dead, or a celebration of the dead of the polytheists. Rather, he was a detainee for people, for the youth, for their games, and for their amusement. If you see that you are short in the Fajr prayer, if you see that the doors of goodness, righteousness, and good deeds are open to you, then do not think that this is from yourself. Rather, know that Allah, Almighty, is the One who has taken you. Allah, Almighty, says in the verse 46 of Surah At-Tawbah, And if they wanted to leave, i.e. the hypocrites, they would have prepared a preparation for it. But Allah disliked their departure, so He made them stand, and it was said, Sit with those who sit. If they wanted to leave, if they had a good intention, Allah, Almighty, would have helped them. But Allah disliked their departure, so He made them stand. And you, Allah, Almighty, disliked your waking up for Fajr, because you have no intention in Fajr prayer, nor preparation, so He made you stand and made you sleep. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, Allah, Almighty, has prevented him from the events that the youth and the youth of his people are in. He, peace and blessings be upon him, would not have listened to the false promises of [comment], and the false gods, and he was suffering from that great suffering. Jaber bin Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them, says that when the Ka'bah was built, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and Abbas went to move the stones. So Abbas said to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, Put your saddle on your neck to protect you from the stones. And the matters of the Awarat at that time were in great ease. And the men were with the men, and this is a normal thing for them. And this is forbidden in our Shari'a. And unfortunately, this is still the case with us. You find that men change clothes in the rooms, and maybe one of them is naked like a camel, and people look at him. And women in the celebrations, in the celebrations, wear the Aari, the transparent, the short. And all this is forbidden. Jaber says, he fell to the ground, and his eyes looked up to the sky, then he looked down, and he said, Izari, Izari, and he pulled his saddle. So Allah, Almighty, protects him, until when he wanted to lift his saddle, his Aarat appeared to carry the stones to build the Ka'bah. Great worship. Allah, Almighty, protected him, and made him fall on his back, and his Aarat did not appear. So when he got up, he said, Izari, Izari, and he avoided showing his 'Awrah. So Allah protected his Prophet peace be upon him and all who have eyes and have\n  a share of fairness and justice. If he  looked at his Seerah he would know that this is a sign of his Prophethood Even if you do not look at the Quran or Hadith, Look at his biography which is pure and preserved, look at how Allah protected him, and  you will see that this is a sign of his Prophethood peace be upon him [End of Episode]"
