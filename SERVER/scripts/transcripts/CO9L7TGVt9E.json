  "transcript": "Abdur Rahman from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi I'm a new Muslim, I only took Shahada last September I'm working as an electrician for a housing association and I'm travelling every day city to city Now, sometimes I miss Dhuhr Is that a sin? Because some cities don't have masjids and I come by them when I can Is that a sin? Especially in the winter when the time is closed for praying Okay, first of all, Alhamdulillah who guided you to accepting Islam May Allah Azza Wa Jal make you steadfast on this religion till the day you die Secondly, if you're travelling from one city to the other as in the state of travelling from London to Birmingham or to Manchester this is considered to be travelling You are allowed to shorten your Dhuhr and Asr prayers into two rak'ahs and you're also allowed to combine them whether at the time of Dhuhr or delay Dhuhr to pray it at the time of Asr before sunset without a problem, Alhamdulillah Either way, if you're not a traveller you must pray on time and the beautiful thing of this scenario is that the Prophet said, alayhi salatu wa salam Allah the Almighty has made the earth a place for prayer and a means of purification so whenever prayer is due a Muslim must pray whatever you want to pray on the streets, in the park, in the garden you can pray as long as you're facing the Qibla and you're standing up and you are in the state of wudu and Allah knows best"
