  "title": "If someone comes to my house & I know they will be free mixing, can I just go & give Salam?",
  "transcript": "We have Ibrahima from Guinea. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. May Allah bless you and your family, Sheikh. And you as well. Sheikh, I wanted to ask, obviously we know that freemixing is haram and everything. If we have a visitor like coming to the house, let's say a friend of the family or something, and we know that obviously freemixing will happen and stuff, are we allowed to go and greet the person and then leave the place where the freemixing is happening? Is it in your place or you're visiting? No, in our place, like where I live with my family and stuff. But I know that freemixing will happen or it's happening. Can I go and just say Assalamu Alaikum to you and stuff and then I leave the place? If there are women of the opposite gender present, no you're not allowed to go and give salam. You just go to your own room or leave the house. Because if you go and give salam, you have to tell them that this is haram, this is freemixing, you must not have such freemixing around. But giving them salam and leaving without saying anything, that would be approving what they're doing and this is not permissible and Allah knows best. you"
