  "transcript": "Bint Inayatullah from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Some scholars have a difference of opinion regarding paying Zika outside the country and even cities. So if someone lives in Islamabad, for example, Pakistan, there are many poor deserving people here, but they want to give part of their Zika to Palestine people, for example. But if it doesn't reach due to Israeli forces, the donor may not know. So is this duty discharged? And can you say if that's recommended in any best organization? JazakAllah First of all, it is an issue of dispute whether Zakat can be transferred to another country or it must be spent in the same country. And the reason is the Hadith of Mu'adh Ibn Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, when the Prophet, Alayhi Salatu Wasalam, sent him from Medina to Yemen to become a judge, a teacher, and a da'ia. And he ordered him to call these people of the book to Islam, to do this and to do this. And then when he reached Zakat, he told him and informed them that Allah mandated upon them a percentage on their wealth to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. So scholars looked at this Hadith and said, this is a clear indication that the Zakat should be taken from the rich and given to the poor of the same city, the same country. And usually this is logical because you cannot be a good carpenter fixing people's doors with your own door in your house broken. You have to begin with your own house. Other scholars looked at the Hadith and they said, okay, read on and don't stop here. And if you read on, you would find that the companions used to collect the Zakat from Yemen, distribute some of it there and ship the rest to Medina. And in Medina, they would allocate it to those who are in need as well. And they said, this is a clear example that the Zakat can be transferred to other countries and towns and cities as long as there is a need for the Muslims. I personally support this latter opinion. And if we are able to send our Zakat money to our brothers and sisters in Palestine, in Gaza, it has to be done. And if you give it to a trustworthy organization to the best of your knowledge and ability, what happens to it doesn't matter. Because Allah has accepted it the moment you gave it to that organization and your job is done whether it reaches them or not. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
