  "transcript": "faizan from india just one question the question is uh in brief that whenever i am praying recently i read that you could have a specific intention for example i'm praying mahrif or you could have the intention of the prayer of the time so whenever i'm praying like shaytan is confusing me like is did you intend maghrib or did you intend the prayer of the time so what is the solution okay i will answer inshallah faizan from india says there is the concept of the intention of a prayer and the intention of time what does that mean see when i go and pray wahr i'm aware that this is lor it is 12 30 i'm going to pray but sometimes i'm not uh in my senses my mind is not present so i perform mudu i repeat after the then i go to the masjid and i say allahu akbar and in the middle of the first raqqa what is this is it is it asir what am i doing so i need to spend some time to re assure myself that this is luhr some scholars say your prayer is invalid why he said because you did not have the intention of in the beginning other scholars like evan taymiah says no no the prayer is valid because your intention was to pray the prayer of the time and this is the only prayer of the time which is so your intention is valid you don't have to confuse yourself because you did not name it"
