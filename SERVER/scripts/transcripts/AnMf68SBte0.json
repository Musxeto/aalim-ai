  "transcript": "The question is, if I have a best friend and I have already told my best friend to come closer to Allah and then ask him to pray and stuff like that, but he does not listen about it, what should I do? Allah Azza Wa Jal tells us in the Qur'an, On the Day of Judgment, best friends in this life will be enemies, except the righteous. So this friend of yours, in this life, either you pull him to Islam or he pulls you to sin. You choose. He has to, first of all, give him advice. But if he doesn't want to, what should you do? Beat him? No. If someone does not want to listen, there are thousands of others who want to listen. Leave him and go to the other thousands. Because I don't have time to waste. I can spend with a brother five days, but he's not listening. When I can sit with ten brothers, five minutes, and they listen, what is more beneficial? It's time."
