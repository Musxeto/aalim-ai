  "transcript": "Our first caller is Syed from Singapore Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Okay, so this is about the question that I asked you last Saturday, if you could remember correctly Actually, I wasn't asking about whether the group iftar gathering is communism or not But rather I did use the word communal but it is different from communism That was after when you asked me to clarify what sort of iftar gathering is And I answered it is a communal iftar gathering And communal, for your info, it means something or an event which is being used by a group of people rather than one single person Okay, so what's the problem? If you mean that the ruling of people bringing food to the masjid and eating together, is this what you mean? Okay, so my actual question here was, I hope you listen to me carefully So you can consider this as my today's question Okay, so a Muslim brother made a post on social media where he mentioned that he don't like to have iftar meals in a masjid Where meals are typically served on a single huge plate for four to six people and they eat directly from it His concern is that attending iftar with such a setting may lead to others taking his favourite portion of the meal during the seed iftar session Which could result in him confronting the individual in question by slapping his face Therefore, what is the best advice I can give to him? If you're going to be the religious police and wanting to question every remark someone writes on social media Or any action a person wants to do or thinks of doing, this is not going to work Life is too short, such ignorant imbeciles must not be even addressed or their post must not be read Who is he to say such a thing publicly and people would like to address that? Move on brother, go and learn religion, learn Qur'an, learn the sunnah Eating from the same plate is a sunnah from the Prophet as we will discuss later on He himself said do not disperse and eat alone like in open buffets, you take your plate and go and eat alone No, he said eat from the same plate because the blessing of Allah descends upon it So if someone says I don't want to do this and he justifies it because he's selfish He doesn't want people to eat from the thing that he wants to eat from So it's okay for him to eat it but not others to eat that And he wants to slap people on the face and this is an ignorant imbecile Who cares what he wants and what he does not want? Ignore him and move on, life is too short Thanks for watching!"
