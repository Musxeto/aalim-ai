  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Germany So my question is if we are \noutside time for prayer but   uh like there's no mosque near us \nbut the Qibla app they show different   um they show different ways to Mecca so we \ndon't really know which app we should trust   um what should we do in this case first \nof all there are conditions that must be   fulfilled before a prayer if these conditions \nare not fulfilled without a legitimate reason   then the prayer is invalid such as purity someone \nprays without performing wudu out of forgetfulness   then he remembers afterwards his prayer is invalid \nsomeone who prays without covering his aura   his prayer is invalid someone who prays before the \ntime of the prayer so one minute Before Sunset he   starts to pray his prayer is invalid and likewise \nsomeone who prays to other than the direction   of the Qibla his prayer is invalid unless he \nwas told by a Muslim who is trustworthy that   the Qibla is this way and he prayed this \nway then he discovered that it's this way   his prayer is valid because he did the best in his \nability and he asked a Muslim who misinformed him   or if a person is in the desert and he \ntried his level best to navigate and   decide where the Qibla is and to the best of \nability he thought that the Qibla was here and   the Qibla was there his prayer is valid because \nhe doesn't have the means now if you are outside   there is no Masjid and you have your \napp that says that the Qibla is this way   but another app says it's this way and the \nthird app says it's this way this slight   diversion is permissible and acceptable the \nQibla for the people of Medina was to the South   of Medina however the prophet Allah \nasked about the slight diversion   he said what's between the East and the West is \nQibla so all of this is considered to be when   there is a um a slight Divergent and inability \nto determine so alhamdulillah you have the way   to pray to the best of your ability in this case \nbecause no app would say it's this way and another   one would say 180 degrees the opposite it's a \nslight diversion by a few degrees here and there and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
