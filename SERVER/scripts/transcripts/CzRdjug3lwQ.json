  "transcript": "sonia says can a woman wear jeans now we know that a muslim woman has conditions for the attire she wears so we have a dress code specifically for women that is more strict than the the dress code of men and why is that it's very simple this is human nature people are drawn to beautiful bodies of women while beautiful bodies of men do not usually attract them this is why islam mandates hijab on women but it does not mandate hijab on handsome beautiful men therefore part of the conditions of a muslim woman attire is that it does not fit her body it does not show her body curves and bone structure and this is regarding her going out in front of none men but it also applies to going in front of her mahram relatives so a woman should wear normal clothes in front of her brother's father in front of her uncles in front of her sons these normal clothes should not be seductive even though they are her mahram at the end of the day shaytan is there so she must not wear jeans in front of them because jeans by nature fits a woman's body and shows her curves when she's sitting when she's standing within bending and this allows shaytan to intervene when people have illness in their hearts so islam prohibits this what about other women the same thing with other women she's allowed to wear jeans when she's alone in her home or when she's in the presence of her husband and there's no problem in that or when she's wearing a long shirt or t-shirt that goes down to her knees so it hides her buttocks and waist and her thighs in this case that would be permissible in sha allah other than that she must refrain from it and allah knows best you"
