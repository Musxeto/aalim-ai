  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is if I see some Muslims doing like acts of kufr not necessarily if and not necessarily intentionally but like they might be doing it ignorantly and I don't give example like just general so if they do things like swearing by other than Allah and I don't stop them from doing it but I do like I don't join them in doing it and I just like go away would there be any sin on me if you are afraid or you have something to stop you from giving advice In Sha Allah there's no sin as long as you've walked away from them but it's not logical if you pass by people even random people you don't know and one of them says by the prophet this is mine in a shirk shirk what is wrong that you say with a big smile and move out there's nothing he will smile back and say none of them will pick up a fight and the worst of them would ignore you so just move on you did your duty but to keep on seeing munkars evil things and not do anything about it just because you're shy or this or that akhi the whole community would fall into the gutters and would be destroyed when the munkar when the evil is public and no one is denouncing it or saying anything about it the whole community the whole country would fall and be defeated may Allah protect us all"
