  "transcript": "Hassan from Japan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? Hayyakallah I want to ask about the Quran that like in some some ayahs are too long and there's no harakat such as like jeem, salah or qala you know and also one of my friend told me that you cannot stop anywhere you want like you know because it changes the meaning I'm aware of that but like I also try to stop where like where or if is exists but like I don't know total the meaning of the ayah so like where should I stop you know if the ayah is long and there is no signs of stopping or recommendation you can stop wherever you want and then take a breath and begin a word from where you stopped and continue your recitation without any problem"
