  "transcript": "Ok, Amman from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam to Allah Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam to Allah How are you doing Sheikh? I'm doing great, Alhamdulillah Sheikh, my question is, I came across a verse in Surah Sa'ad It said that, about Ayyub A.S. So, my question was, we know that everything good or evil or any disease or any affliction that comes is from Allah So, in this verse, Ayyub A.S. specifically said that, I've been touched by adversity from Shaitaan So, I just wanted some clarity on this, like, how do I combine these things, like, every good and bad comes from Allah So, Ayyub A.S. said, I've been touched by adversity from Shaitaan So, can you help me with that? Jazakallah Khair Wa Jazak We acknowledge that Allah is the creator of everything, whether good or evil Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala There is no other creator than Allah But we do not attribute pure evil to Allah Azzawajal As in the Hadith, Meaning, it's not attributed to you, pure evil But, things have evil and have good in them Now, having said that, and acknowledging that Allah is the creator of all No one in his right mind would not attribute evil to the one who does it So, if someone comes and kills your loved one, kills your brother, may Allah forbid Would you say, Allah killed my brother? Or, the assailant, this criminal killed my brother You tell me Of course you would say, this perpetrator did his crime And, likewise, if someone smacks your car You would say that this driver smacked my car So, you attribute it to him But, we acknowledge that the creator of everything in this universe is Allah, the Almighty By this, I think there is no issue, and Allah knows best"
