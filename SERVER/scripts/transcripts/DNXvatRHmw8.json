  "title": "Deeds are judged by intention so what about if I get wiswas in shirk or kufr?",
  "transcript": "from bangladesh he says that the hadith deeds are judged by intention and i get these intrusive thoughts whether i committed kuffar or not whether allah has forgiven this for the sake of the prophet was whether this was shirk or not all of these intrusive thoughts are from shaitaan and as long as you did not verbalize them and you not act upon them just contemplating and dwelling upon them in your head has no impact so move on and neglect it"
