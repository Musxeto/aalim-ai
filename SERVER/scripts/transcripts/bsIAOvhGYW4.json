  "title": "Can You Wipe Over Cotton Normal Socks ðŸ§¦ assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "and our first caller for today is Nazar from India sh I actually came to know about the ruling of wiping over the socks from a past videos but recently someone informed me about that it cannot be done on normal cotton socks that are thin we usually wear and has to be the ks that are of leather or else it defies the purpose of WI over it is it true this is an issue of dispute among Scholars and whenever there is an is issue of dispute we refer to the Quran and to the Sunnah as commanded by Allah whenever you differ over a topic then refer it back to Allah and to his messenger sallallahu alaih wasallam which means to the Quran and to the Sunnah and this is what the authentic Scholars did you see there are those who blind follow their schools of thought whatever they find in their books they say oh the said so and so and we follow it why because Simon says because the maab says and we cannot go out of the boundaries of the maab says who are your madhabs mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah no yes we do respect all schools of thought and all great imams are respected and honored in our beliefs but nobody is infallible other than the prophet Alat wasam so if im Abu hanifah or IM Malik or Imam Muhammad shafii or IM Ahmed muhammadh said something we honor it but we have to cross-examine it with the Quran and the Sunnah so when someone restricts H or wiping on the HS to only to be made of leather that is an exaggeration and a generalization that is not acceptable because at the time of the Prophet Alam the companions used to you wear that were made of leather but also they used to wrap their feet with and some types of clothings that they used to walk in or and the likes and it was not made of leather so the most authentic opinion and this is the ease and simplicity of Islam the convenience of Islam anything that you wear on your feet that you put on can be wiped over regardless whether it's transparent or not whether it's made of cotton or made of nylon or any other fabric as long as it fits your foot and it sticks there by itself it doesn't fall down and it covers your feet the area that should be washed up to the ankle in this case this does the job with alham"
