  "transcript": "Ameen from Bahrain Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I stay in Bahrain and there is an Islamic bank by the name of Al Baraka Bank which is 100% Islamic. Now they have some system where if we put our money in fixed deposit So if you put fixed deposit for 6 months they give you 4% or 4.5% based on your amount. So is it Is the percentage fixed on the capital? Meaning you will get, if you put your money for 6 months, we will give you 4% of these 100,000 Dinar you put. Is it fixed, the 4%? Yes Ameen Yes sir, yes sir Is it fixed? Yes it is fixed, like if I give 100,000 they will give me 4.5% This is totally riba and it's totally haram to deal with such a bank. Any fixed amount of money, which is the percentage, because you said 4.5% of the capital, not of the profits. The profits is no problem because we don't know what the profit would be. It can be 5 Dirham Dinars, it can be 5 million Dirham Dinars. There is no problem in setting a percentage over the profit. But when someone says, give me 100,000 Euros and after 6 months I will give you back 104,000 Euros. Meaning 4% over the capital invested. This is complete riba, total riba. So regardless of what the bank's name is or what they're doing or they're claiming to be 100% halal. If it's like what I said to you, it is totally haram to invest with them."
