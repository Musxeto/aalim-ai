  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, around 8 or 9 years ago when I was a Kafir, Alhamdulillah for being guided, I had a non-Muslim girlfriend and I can't remember if I gave her a plain bracelet or a bracelet which things dangle off which people don't signify that like for example hearts, they don't signify it with repelling like anything evil or if I gave her a bracelet which had things dangling off that people associate with repelling evil which is shirk Sheikh, is this me overthinking because I can't remember or should I investigate and see if I've given people gifts in the past which are not allowed and then enjoying good and forbid evil because even a friend of mine, a guide friend who I don't speak to anymore I gave him a watch, can't remember if it was gold or silver but the strap was burgundy so is this just me overthinking or should I go and investigate? Jazakallahu Khair This is you overthinking in addition to Satan marinating these thoughts in your head to make a good meal out of it whatever you had done in the past as a Catholic or as a disbeliever or as a Kafir has no impact on your life today being a revert, being a Muslim erases all what you have done in the past so this is a new chapter of your life you should disregard any such thoughts, not think about it and move on with your life"
