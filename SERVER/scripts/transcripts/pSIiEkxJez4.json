  "transcript": "Carlos from Brazil Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu What is the ruling in prayer where there are books on whose covers there are images? If there are books with images such as newspapers or magazines or normal books with images of human beings, the best is to turn them over and cover these images. If it is not possible, then you have to try and pray in a room that has no such images. If this is again not possible, then you may pray due to necessity and your prayer is valid In Sha Allah."
