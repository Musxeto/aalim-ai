  "title": "What is the beginning and end time of Morning and Evening Athkaar? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "says what is the beginning and the end time of morning and evening supplications this is a good question we know that there are so many enemies out there and without our armor we're vulnerable for attack so if you don't have your body armor if you don't have your bulletproof vest if you don't have protection you are susceptible to evil eye blackmagic envy engine possession may allah protect all of us so what is to be done among the first that come on the list are the athkar of morning and evening so these atkar constitute your antivirus your armor your vest that is bulletproof so it protects you and if you fail to say them you're not protected maybe you'll get something maybe you'll not it depends on what allah has decreed for you so what are the times for the morning athkar the beginning it's after the ivana fajr so no doubt once the adhan is given the dawn after the break of dawn you can say the atkar of the morning and for the evening they differ some say after asar others say after maghrib and both have their evidence is backing it up i'm inclined to say it after maghrib this is the beginning what about the end as for the morning atkar some say it ends with the sunrise and others say it can end at the end of doha time which is about 10 minutes before the adhan of bearing in mind that if i say it at 10 o'clock for example from the break of dawn till 10 i'm not protected so it is essential to say it as soon as possible so the beginning we know break of dawn the end either by sunrise or by ten minutes before adhan of lahore what about the evening at car the beginning is an issue of dispute whether it's asar so for those who say asar they say that it can be extended until sunset and some say that no it can be extended until the first third of the night which is usually like 10 o'clock in normal times and those who say that it begins at maghrib sunset they say it is extended until the first third of the night expires but again we should not mess around with it and we should try our level best to pray it on time to say it on time"
