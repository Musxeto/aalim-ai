  "transcript": "Sheikh, so I didn't finish my question. I already did the things you said. I talked to him about Syria and other things that have to do with Islam. So the thing is if he dies now and I am in this situation where his relatives want to burn him and I'm standing there and say he was Muslim, he shouldn't be cremated, I will get into trouble. I may get beaten up. I may get beaten up or I was sent to the psychiatrist three times before because my father calls me Wahabi. Long story. So how much effort do I need to invest to prevent them? Is it like when I'm forced to say Kufr, I need to give really much strength? I don't know. I'm nervous. Sorry. So how much effort do I need to invest to prevent them from doing this? You can't do anything according to the law. Everything is in your grandfather's hand. If he writes a will saying that I want to be cremated, then it will be implemented. If he writes a will and tells those who are around him and writes a legal document that I would like to be buried as a Muslim, then it will be followed. You as a grandchild in the presence of all of his sons and daughters have no say. And even if you say that he was a Muslim, they will say prove it. And you won't be able to prove it. And this is why I said to you in the beginning that you have to try to strengthen his Iman, uplift it, and make him make such a statement and endorse or not endorse, proclaim and say that he's a Muslim so that everybody knows what to do afterwards. If he fails to do this, this is his fault, his problem, and not yours. And Allah knows best."
