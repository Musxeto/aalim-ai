  "transcript": "Okay, every single person here has a test from Allah. Correct or wrong? Everyone. Even the richest man on earth, who is he? Elon Musk. Twitter, huh? He has tests. Yes, he has tests. The difference is, on earth, you will live maximum 80 to 90 years and then you will die. When you die, you get the results of your test. Pass, Alhamdulillah. Pass, go to Jannah. Alhamdulillah. Fail, go to hell. So now, each and every one of you is being tested. What to do? My son, if I had a son, died. I have one of two options. Option one, to be patient, to be tolerant and say, Inna lillah wa inna ilayhi raji'un. Allahumma ajirni fee musibati wa khlifni khayran minha. And I feel sad for my son, but I don't do anything bad. What will happen? My son is dead. Will he become alive? No, he's dead. Khalas. But on the day of judgment, there is a house Allah builds for me. It's called Baytul Hamd. The house of Hamd. Because I was patient. Option number two, my son died. Why? Why me? I love my son. My son, he's dead. I bang my head in the wall. I tear my clothes. I shout, I scream. Why he did not lose his son? Why did he not lose his daughter? Why me? Why Allah doesn't love me? One month, I cry, I weep, I complain. Is my son coming to life? He's dead. But on the day of judgment, come, come, come. I tested you. You failed the test. Take him to hell. This is life. Allah tests me and you with health, with wealth, with power, with family. And he tests others with poverty, with illness, with insecurity. You here, Alhamdulillah, are very happy. You have a roof on your head. You have food on the table. Look, mashallah, bananas, grapes, croissant. You have water. You go to Yemen. Go to Syria. Go to the Rohingya. Go to Africa. They don't have this. They wish they had this, what you're having. But you, when I ask you, how are you? Sheikh, I am suffering. I don't have money. I don't have a car. My friend has a motorcycle. I don't have motorcycle. I want to have motorcycle. And if you have a motorcycle, I want a ninja Kawasaki. Why? He said, oh, I don't want small motorcycle. I want something big and strong. And if you have a motorcycle, he said, no, I wish I can have a Corolla. Toyota is good car. If you have a Corolla, I have a BMW. BMW, Mercedes. Mercedes, I would like to have Maybach. Maybach, I would like to have Chiron or Veyron, Bugatti. Till when? You'll never be happy. You'll never be Alhamdulillah. I have water. I want this. I want that. Therefore, everyone is being tested. Rarely, you will find people passing the test. Rarely, you will find people saying Alhamdulillah. And this is why the Prophet said, when you drink water or you eat food and you say, Alhamdulillah, Allah is pleased with you. He gave me the water. He gave me the food and he taught me how to thank him. And he is pleased when I do this. Not only that, and he forgives all of your sins. Subhanallah. How merciful Allah is. So always be content. Life is a cycle. Today, you're here. Tomorrow, you're rich and healthy. Day after tomorrow, you're sick and have debts. After one week, Allah will pay off your debts. This is how life is. May Allah make our life a good life in this dunya and in the hereafter, inshallah."
