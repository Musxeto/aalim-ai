  "transcript": "faran from India alayum how are you I'm fine alhamdulillah how can I help you faran my question is a person I know he boosts about his Beauty every time 247 is is this considered arrogance and what what is the ruling on people who don't thank Allah for their Duty thank you he boasts about his Good Deeds yeah Beauty uh no his facial Beauty you know his uh appearance his Beauty okay okay okay now this is considered form of arrogance and unfortunately it is also a self-inflicted evil eye when people talk about how beautiful they are how handsome how strong how fast how smart this is arrogance but it is not part of the arrogance that may impact their forms of because they're not showing off and boasting about their prayers or their Good Deeds rather about a gift that Allah has given them without praising Allah and thanking Allah and glorifying Allah this is a dangerous thing to do first because it draws an evil eye from yourself upon yourself and from others secondly it breaks people's hearts when they're not as fortunate as you are thirdly it gains you a lot of hatred and grudges in other people's hearts which is not a very smart thing to do Mooney from Canada"
