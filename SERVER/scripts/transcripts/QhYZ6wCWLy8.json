  "transcript": "we have Fatima from Nigeria sent up to LA okay I woke up this morning lovin my sister woke me up and the lighting check the time I went to the kitchen and I he took my support and then everything after I kick him back to the room I realized van was called 20 minutes ago but I had a feeling that I then-husband hold but she just woke me up and told me it was the whole time so I took my support and then I realized that I've done was been called 20 minutes ago okay I have passed a pallet boards I will answer insha'Allah father Oh Buttercup Muffy come Fatima says that her sister woke her up she didn't check the time she was under the impression that it's not time yet so her sister confirmed that so she went and had sir her and after finishing and looking at the watch she realized that she exceeded the time of a than by two or three minutes so is her fasting valid the answer is yes as long as you were not certain that the I then was called if you had just a feeling then this feeling is to be ignored because in order for you to stop you have to be certain uncertainty is done either by hearing the Adhan or by seeing the break of dawn but when you don't have this and you don't have any other evidence to support that it is fed your time then I hope in Charla that your CRM and your fasting is valid"
