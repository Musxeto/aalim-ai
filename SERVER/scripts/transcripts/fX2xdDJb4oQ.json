  "title": "Burning Red Chillies or hanging things to remove evil eye",
  "transcript": "faran from India okay can you speak yes I can yes now so uh the burning of chilies to remove evil ey it is halal or Haram or is a sh and some people hang aloe vera and many other things to protect protect them from black magic and everything else so is believing in this sh or is anything no doing of such kind sh burning of chili or spreading salt and black pepper and Curry spices to word of gin or evil eye or black magic all of this is nonsense it is not mentioned in the Quran it is not mentioned in the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet Alam and none of the companions had done this so such a practice in my own view acts as a person believes in superstitions and not only that it acts as if they are offering sacrifice to the Jin maybe the Jin love Chili's and they like it burnt I don't know so there is no point in burning it or using mustard gas or the likes toward of Jin because we have no evidence or proof neither from the Quran nor from the Sunnah that this is an effective way or a legitimate way to ward off gin and black magic hence it is an innovation it's part of the Superstition and if it is made as a form of sacrifice then it's shik as in some places when they build a new house before they enter it they slaughter a sheep or a goat at the doorsteps and they put the blood on the doorsteps seeking Baraka this is a sacrifice to the Jin so that they would not haunt their house and cause any problems for them and this is sh may Allah protect us all"
