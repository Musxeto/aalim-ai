  "title": "Can a woman stay in her married sister's house as her brother in law is not a mahram & travel alone?",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. So what is the ruling on visiting my sister in another country? She lives with my nephew and my niece and her husband. And they have like a two bedroom. Can I stay with them for two weeks? Even though her husband is there and it's not my mahram. Are you travelling with a mahram or alone? Well my husband is going to take me to the airport and he's going to meet me there. It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to travel without the presence of her mahram. So your husband taking you to the airport, you'll be travelling alone on the airplane without a mahram. And this makes you fall under the prohibition of travelling without a mahram, which the Prophet ﷺ prohibited and made it forbidden among women. There is a possibility something happens and the airplane has to do an emergency landing in a country. We never know what will happen in the aircraft, whether you would need the assistance of a mahram or not. We don't know who will sit next to you. So there are so many reasons but we don't care about these reasons. We care about the instruction of the Prophet ﷺ of not allowing a woman to travel without a mahram. If your husband is going to travel with you all the way to that place where your sister lives, and you live in a separate room, segregated 100% from your brother-in-law, he doesn't see you, he doesn't get in touch with you, socialize with you, mix with you, there's no problem in that, insha'Allah. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days. And then, bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
