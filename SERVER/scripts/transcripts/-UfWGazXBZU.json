  "title": "Must uncover ears & remove niqab for exam to get a halal job, is this a valid neccessity",
  "transcript": "jobs in Bangladesh have exams to get the job. And during exam one must remove make-up and show her ears also. The job is halal though, so is it permissible during exam to show face and ears for identification? Probably I have to keep my face open the whole day, like during the whole exam, or if not face at least I have to show my ears. If there is a necessity that demands this, and necessity is something that is measured by the true nature and gravity of such a necessity. If I have a cut on my pinky, a small wound, that does not justify me eating pork when I'm hungry. But if I'm stranded in the desert, and I'm about to die, and I'm losing all of my power, and there's nothing in sight halal to consume, and there is no help in sight, and if I don't eat one or two morsels of that pork meat in front of me, I am definitely going to die. Here it becomes a necessity. So we have to look into what you're up to. If you need a passport to travel, and the authorities insist that you show your face and maybe part of your hair or part of your ears just for identification, which is very very strange and not normal, and it seems that this is one of the ways of humiliating the Muslims and insulting them. But if there is a necessity for you to travel, then yes. If there is no necessity, then the answer is no. You cannot compromise your hijab for such a reason. If you're sick and you have to go to the doctor and the doctor has to look at some parts of your body in order to treat you, or to operate upon you, this is a necessity. But if you want to do this to a saloon, for example, where the hairdresser is a man, and you have a wedding and you want to fix your hair, of course this is not permissible, and I hope this answers your question."
