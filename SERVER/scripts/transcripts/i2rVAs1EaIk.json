  "transcript": "Siddique from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, my question is, it is Sunnah to repeat the Adhan, so what should we do if we hear a Tarjiya in Adhan? You should do the same. And just to clarify, a Tarjiya is to repeat the Shahada in the Adhan secretly or quietly. So when the Mu'adhin says, Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, then he makes it loudly. If you hear the silent Tarjiya, then you have to say that as well, but most likely you won't hear it and Allah knows best."
