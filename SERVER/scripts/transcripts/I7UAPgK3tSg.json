  "transcript": "i personally and strongly feel that in such countries the khutba has to be in their native language if you go to malaysia giving the khutba in arabic would not serve the purpose of the khutba which is to enlighten people and to educate them you have to speak in malay you have to speak in the native language of the people if you go to the uk don't give it in arabic because the vast majority don't understand give it in english everybody understands it in english and include in your khutbah a verse from the quran in arabic one hadith in arabic and the pillars have been fulfilled and the goal has been achieved and allah knows best you"
