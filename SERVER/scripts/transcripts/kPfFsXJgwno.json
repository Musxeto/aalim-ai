  "title": "I make a long Dua in Sujood, can I finish my Dua or cut it short to follow the Imam?  assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "So if I'm doing jamaat prayer on the last sujood, I usually make dua for a long amount of time. If the imam already lifts his head, can I cut my dua or can I just continue to pray my dua? Jazak Allah. Jazak Allah. You must, you must cut your dua and follow the imam. It is not permissible to be late than the imam. And the follower has four types of following the imam. Either he coincides with the imam and follows the imam, meaning when the imam make rukuh, he makes rukuh. When the imam rises up, he rises up. No delay. Number two, he coincides and imitates the imam. So as soon as the imam says Allahu Akbar, he does with it. Sami'allahu liwan hamda, he rises with him. And this is wrong. He should wait until he reaches the standing position. He should wait until he puts his forehead on the ground before he bends his back. The third is to be ahead of his imam. So as the imam goes for a rukuh and says Allah, and the guy is already in sujood before the imam. This nullifies his prayer if done intentionally. And number four is to delay. So the imam rises up from sujood, Allahu Akbar, and the guy is still doing dua. Until the imam is going to go for the second sujood, he raises up and follows him. This is also not permissible."
