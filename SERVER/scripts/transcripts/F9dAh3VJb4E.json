  "title": "How to solve Marriage Problems, husband wants to live on Mars, I'm not a nagging wife",
  "transcript": "The next question is, my husband does not want the hassles of a worldly life and wishes to live on Mars. Can a man leave his family and live a life of sortitude on another planet? P.S. I am not an angry wife, also our kids are great. So don't look for perfection before you look in the mirror. And if you look in the mirror, you will look for another planet as well. And Allah knows best."
