  "transcript": "cd from belgium so my question is is it true that on the day of judgement allah we give life to all the drawings that mankind did and throw them in your fire give life to all the drawings and throw them in hell fire or use them to punish people with allah will give life to all the jewellery no drawings drawings okay okay i will answer you inshallah there is an authentic hadith or actually a number of authentic hadiths that intimidate muslims from drawing or making sculptures now muslims are not driven by what is right and what is wrong through their intuition or through their gut feeling they're driven by the quran and the sunnah this is why we are muslims we submit our will to allah azzawajal by reading the quran and the authentic prophetic sunnah teachings of the prophet islam and stimming whatever allah wants from us from it so why do we say this is halal and this is haram because this is what's mentioned in the quran this may go not very well with atheists with hypocrites with liberals with those who are arrogant and don't want to comply with allah's orders because a lot of the people nowadays use their logic why why is this it doesn't make any sense one of the brothers sent us a tweet this morning saying is bird chipping haram so when birds sing this is like music so if music haram birds are also performing something haram how stupid such a coat is so if birds have intimacy and mate with one another does this make it halal for us to fornicate without marriage it doesn't make any sense but this is the logic that some people have driven by shaytan so they come to beautiful arts and they say what's the reason of making these beautiful statues and sculptures and drawings look at the mona lisa you could stare at it for hours without end why do you make it i didn't make anything haram it's allah azzawajal who created me and he told me what is what is haram so these authentic hadiths cast fear in our hearts from even getting close to drawings the prophet alaihis stated that the most severely tormented people on the day of judgment are those who make such quote-unquote fine arts who draw and make sculptures they will be instructed on the day of judgment to give life to it and they won't be able to do this and life will be given into it and it will be a cause of their torment and punishment in hellfire so these sculptures and these drawings will be given life to torture them in hell fire and there are so many a hadith where allah would challenge them while they are in hell to create an ant to create a a string of barley or whatever a branch of barley and they would not be able to do that so may allah azzawajal protect us and keep us safe you"
