  "transcript": "from the UK in prayer I when I pray with my 9-year-old daughter I always lead however she can also pray by herself good even though she's a bit fast my question is can I sometimes allow her to be the IM and Lead Me In Prayer there is no problem inshallah in having a child who is aware of his actions such as an 8 year or a 9-year-old child to be the Imam as long as this is for a legitimate reason and they know how to pray there's no problem at all in this inshallah"
