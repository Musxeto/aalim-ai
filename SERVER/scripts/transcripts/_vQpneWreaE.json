  "title": "Are Religious Challenges on Social Media Permissible? (Share 10 Hadiths in 10 Days) Assim AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "mukharam says nowadays everyone is giving challenges like 10 days hadith challenge where you share 10 hadith in 10 days to spread good knowledge is this permissible we spoke and commented upon this earlier and we said that competing in religion with a good intention is good so if we compete a competition to know who memorizes the quran or recites it best who memorizes the number of hadiths who would solve a quiz on issues that's good because it is a sort of jihad you're competing with the intention to please allah not to show off what is happening on facebook or on other social media platforms where it's a challenge it's a competition to just spread any ten hadiths random hadiths over the period of ten days and check the box that you have done this this does not fall under the category of competing to spread good knowledge first of all because those who spread these hadiths we don't know whether they're authentic or not secondly they're doing this as a race as a competition not for the sake of allah azzawajal because yes if you were to post a hadith every day with a commentary with teaching people the benefits of it the meaning of it that would be a good job but simply to put a challenge that is bound by days and number of hadiths regardless of what these hadith talk about then this is most likely to um [Music] be a means of showing off and allah knows best you"
