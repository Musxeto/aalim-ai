  "transcript": "And he filtered them all to bring us the Sahih. The Sahih of Al-Bukhari, as you know, is compiled according to chapters in Bid'ah Al-Wahi, in As-Salah, Zakah, Buyu'ah, Marriage, Transactions, according to the Fiqh books. One of the chapters is about Adab. But it is not related to our book. Because in that chapter of Al-Adab, which is all authentic, unlike our book. This book, Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, is not 100% authentic. Why? Because Al-Bukhari had a condition that in his Sahih, he would not report anything except with a particular condition that gives it the highest grade of authenticity. 98 octane, premium, or 90 which is regular. He had premium in Sahih. In Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, it was mixed. And the condition was less. And the bar was lower. Why? Because the people of Al-Bukhari, like today, when we meet, you say, how much is the dollar per the ringgit? You say, four point so. At that time, everybody knew the Isnad. So when I tell you, hadathana so and so, that so and so said, that so and so heard, that Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, alayhis salam. They know that this hadith is authentic or not authentic. Not because they're scholars, but knowledge was so spread that as long as you put the chain of narrators, it's sufficient. It's enough. So the Bukhari put this, which has so much information about adab, but not as authentic as the Sahih Al-Bukhari itself. Okay, then why compile it? Because the issue of adab, the thing that elevates your moral conduct, your ethics, has so many hadiths that may not reach the premium level of hadith, but it is authentic. So that's why he brought us this hadith, or this book, which is approximately three to four times bigger than the one in his Sahih Al-Bukhari, so that we could learn of."
