  "transcript": "there is a difference between zakat money and soda so sadhaka or charity can be giving to muslims non-muslims can be giving to dependents of yours can be given to your parents there's no problem in that while zakat money cannot be given to non-muslims it cannot be given to your dependents or your parents it cannot be given to those whom you are responsible for providing to so once you know this then inshaallah you'll find it easier to understand you"
