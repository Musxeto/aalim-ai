  "transcript": "uh Yusuf from the UK um I'm asking a question \nregarding the Hadith in sahih Muslim in which   the Nabi (Peace and Blessing upon him) says \nhe said when the human being dies his deeds   will stop except for three an ongoing charity \nbeneficial knowledge or a righteous child you   know that pray that prays for who prays for \nhim now I'm wondering if someone for the sake   of you know seeking knowledge or sharing \nbeneficial knowledge if someone is not a   teacher of Islamic knowledge but he teaches \nfor example ESO you know English what's that   it's it's English for speakers of all the \nlanguages okay so if this helped the students in   their lives in the in the future uh would that can \nwould that be considered as a beneficial knowledge   first of all okay I got your question first \nof all Scholars say mainly whenever knowledge   is referred to in the Quran or in the \nSunnah it's related to Islamic knowledge   so anything related to Islamic Sciences \nsuch as Tafsir Hadith Fiqh Usool   Etc this is part of the knowledge that is highly \npraised in Quran and the Sunnah nevertheless if   a person teaches beneficial knowledge with \nthe right intention so a medical doctor   who has done researches that would benefit the \nhuman that would benefit Humanity and people are   benefiting from it and he has students and he's \nconveying his knowledge to them with the right   intention to help Muslims and Islam and promote \nIslam definitely this would be ongoing and uh um Sadaqa Jaariya continuous charity of for \nhim is it equivalent or similar to Islamic   knowledge no but alhamdulillah \nAllah is most uh gracious most   generous and he would not let \nyour efforts go uh uh to waste"
