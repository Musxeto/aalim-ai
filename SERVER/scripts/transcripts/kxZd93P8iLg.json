  "title": "Doubtful about a Sin, is it halal until proven otherwise? (Certainty is not removed by doubt)",
  "transcript": "Anas from the UK. Wa'alaikumussalam. Wa'alaikumussalam. Anas. I was going to ask, if we do something we think it's a sin but we're doubtful. Hello? Yes. Hello? Yes yeah Anas, I can hear you. If we do a sin and think it's like we're doubtful whether it's a sin but due to our circumstances like should we use that ruling where certainty is not overcome by doubt? This is dependent on what you're thinking. If someone thinks that drinking green tea with mint in a black mug is sinful but he's doubtful, he doesn't know, we say no, this is too much, this is ridiculous. Everything is halal and pure by default until proven otherwise. But if there is something that you feel that is rubbing your chest from inside and you feel, I don't like this, I have a very bad feeling, my gut feeling says that this is haram and this is not whispering of shaitan. This is a particular incident that you're more inclined that this is sinful, that normal people would not like this, then you must refrain from it and abstain until you search and are certain. But generally speaking, if someone has this feeling that 95% of everything around him is haram and he's doubtful, should I do this? Should I ride on car and drive on the left steering wheel in normal countries because this is the left or should I get a car in the UK where the steering wheel is on the right, this is the sunnah? This is ridiculous. So you'd have to look into each scenario and knowing that, okay, this deals with the opposite gender, I have a bad feeling about it, stay away. The default is that you should not be in touch with the opposite gender who are non-mahram to you. So there isn't anything to search for at the moment. So you stay away until you find an answer to it, unlike normal things that using a pad or a pen or a mug or whatever, which is normal and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
