  "title": "Can we learn Quran from a Maturidi &  can we marry a Maturidi? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "sajid hassan says can we learn the quran from amitaridhi or can a person marry one of them learning the quran from them is okay if just memorizing if they're going to go to tafsir definitely not stay away anyone who gives tafsir and he does not follow the methodology of sunnah or jamaa and of herself keep your distance away from them because no matter how articulate they are how beautiful they present their case you know that their habit is corrupt and that this would infiltrate your defense system it will keep on into your mind and corrupt your akkid as well and there's nothing more important than apida so anyone who's doubtful in this arcade trying to do something in tafsir or you have to shelve them and get rid of their material marrying from them is the same thing now what is the difference between marrying from an ashari or a maturity or a martezili or a murji or they all have corrupt aquida and the only thing that binds us is our apida claiming that allah is not above his throne where in the quran in the sunnah a blind man can see that and the prophet himself told us about that hassan so how can you marry someone like that and why would you marry someone who would bring up your children i know a lot of arasuno jamaa my daughters my wife my in-laws when they teach the children at an early age of a year or so before they start to speak they play with the children and say where is allah and the child says this above allah is above us allah is in the height and this is the question that the prophet has asked the slave girl where is allah she pointed up and she said in the height who am i she said you're the messenger of allah he said to her owner set her free she's a believer so this is part of your belief if you don't believe that allah is in the height you're not a muslim or at least you're not from alaska for sure so why would you marry someone like that definitely that's bad news even if she was miss universe you"
