  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Denmark so in one of your \nvideos you said that um when madhy like semen   when it dries you can like see it right um so what \nshould one do if they had nocturnal emotions and   then they see that the semen in their underwear \nlike it it was semen they can see that it's like a   dry in its heart and they can see it but when they \nsee it on their bed it has basically disappeared   after a couple of hours right because some of \nthe semen also got on the bed so after like five   seconds hours they see that there's like nothing \non their bed and and there's like no crust like   there's there's no seam in there they can't find \nit so is this semen is is this najis or impure   what because yeah [Questioner] what counts is what \nyou find on your underwear not on your bed sheet   so the question is did you see semen on your \nbed on your underwear yes I'm sure Halas this   is that's what counts you have to go and perform \nGhusl now whether you saw traces of semen on   your bed sheet and then it dried out and you \ndon't see it anymore or not it doesn't matter   because semen is pure so if it dried out and it \nis not visible anymore you can still use the bed   sheet and sleep on it and you have no problem \nwith that none whatsoever and Allah Knows Best"
