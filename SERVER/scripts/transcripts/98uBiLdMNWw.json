  "title": "Get a Prenup if marrying in the West!",
  "transcript": "In the West, and I've been having lots of counseling sessions regarding this issue, if you have to marry, and you definitely, if you're living in the States or in Canada or in Europe or elsewhere, you have to marry. So, before you do this, make a prenup and make a contract that is legally binding that if divorce were to take place, none of the spouses has the right of the property or the wealth of the ex. Because it really goes ugly in such kafir countries when two Muslims divorce and one of them doesn't fear Allah, if he believes in Allah in the first place. So, he or she, they go to the civil court and they demand half of the property or the wealth of their ex. And this is totally haram. So many times women come and say, no, I'm divorced now, I'm entitled for half of the house, which is a million dollars or more. And the husband says, I worked 25 years to earn my hard-earned money through halal means, and I bought this house. Now she wants to take half of it. She says, yes, this is my right. I spent 25 years with him. And this is totally haram. Going to non-Muslim courts and legislating to them and seeking arbitration or a verdict from them to consume your Muslim fellow wealth unlawfully, a lot of the scholars take that person out of the fold of Islam. For not following the conduct, for not following the sharia ruling, rather giving his back to sharia, to the Quran and to the sunnah, doesn't care about any of that, and wanting the ruling of the disbelievers and the man-made laws to consume worldly filth, so that he would be happy for a couple of years and then he would find his torment awaiting for him in his grave and then hellfire awaits for him, inshallah. So before you get married, just before things maybe get ugly, just write a prenup so that legally no one of you could trespass and violate sharia laws by demanding such thing, and Allah knows best.
