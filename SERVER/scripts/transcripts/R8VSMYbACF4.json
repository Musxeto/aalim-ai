  "transcript": "Fidan says that, she wanted to remove her YouTube \naccount due to the fact that she saw something   wrong, or sinful, and she was afraid that, by \nadding the viewership - so instead of having a   million viewers, having a million and one because \nof her - that would endorse this sinful act. So   she wants to delete her YouTube channel account. \nThis is too extreme. there's nothing as such. You   didn't intend it, you did not endorse it, and you \ndo not go around tell people to come and watch.   Watching it, or adding a number to it, \ndoes not count as a sin. The sin is in   watching it intentionally. Adding a \nnumber would not contribute to that."
