  "title": "A man has NO desire to get married but his parents say he must obey them",
  "transcript": "from the UK I am a 20 year I'm 28 years old but I have no desires to get married it's not something that excites me and it's not something that I want in my life but my parents they are pushing me very hard to get married within the next say 2 3 years and they are saying that it's the far of a child to to do what the parent says in Islam No matter what these circumstances so what should I do in this situation well it is not normal for a person your age not to have the desire to marry women because this is only natural however if you are not equipped like everyone else or you have impotency or you don't have any lust or desire to women my advice would be not to get married at all it is totally Haram to harm another human being a woman is interested in getting married to have a companion and to fulfill her natural desires like everyone else and if she's married to someone who's not interested or unable to fulfill such a such Desires in this case it becomes prohibited now the second solution would be if you find someone who is like you who's not interested in having sexual relations it would just want a companion in this case you may get married to such a person and have another roommate that is probably capable of cooking and cleaning for you and that would be a win-win for all parties and who knows maybe something is going to trigger inevitably and eventually uh somewhere down the line and Allah Knows Best"
