  "title": "Allah did not deprive you because he is poor or stingy assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "How about Allah Azza Wa Jal, when you speak about him like this? When Allah deprived you from what you had asked Him, He did not deprive you because He's poor. Allah owns everything in this universe. And when He deprives you, He did not deprive you because He's stingy. Allah is the most generous. Look at billionaires, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and the likes. They have billions and billions. Who gave it to them? Their intellect? Their power? Allah. And Allah can strip them from it in a heartbeat. So when Allah deprives you of something, Wallahi, and I'm swearing, He did this for your goodness. In this life and the hereafter. But the problem is that you refuse to concede and believe. And this means that you have failed your test."
