  "title": "How to know when it is Fajr time on a Plane",
  "transcript": "We have Sumaiyah on the line from the UK. Sumaiyah. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. If you are, if someone is traveling and he's on an airplane and they don't know what, like my sister was traveling and she didn't know what time Fajr was, so she said the sun was rising in some countries and the sun was not rising in other countries, so she said she was really confused and then she said when the sky turned grey, I don't know what the time is, she prayed and they were supposed to land in London at 6.56, so that's past Fajr time, so are they supposed to repeat that prayer because there's like some doubt in it? First of all, when a person is anywhere, the prayer time is related to his position on earth, not where the country of destination is or the country of origin is. If I'm flying, it doesn't matter what time Fajr is anywhere in the world except on the plane I'm in. So Alhamdulillah, while flying, I have the windows up, I can see in the direction of the east, the darkness of the night when the break of dawn appears and I see the white thread horizontally appearing. Now I know it's Fajr. This is my Fajr, regardless of the time or the country. The moment I see it, this is my Fajr. So if she saw the sky was a bit grey, meaning the light has appeared but the sun did not rise and she prayed, then her prayer is valid with the grace of Allah."
