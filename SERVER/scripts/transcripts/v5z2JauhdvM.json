  "transcript": "[Music] uh brother rayan from Saudi Arabia my question is people of deviant sex use the Hadith of prophet sahu alai wasallam that he said about nud that there are earthquakes and tribulations and that the head of Shan will emerge they say that the scholars who follow the of the companions calling them naab so what is the correct interpretation of that Hadith okay we have answered this so many times a first of all if you were walking and a dog barks at you would it be logical to fall on your hands and knees and bark back of course not you won't be living a normal life if you do this so when deviant sects say such irresponsible things illogical things just shrug your shoulders and move on we follow Quran and Sunnah we don't have to pay attention and defend why are the Muslims so defensive all what they do no no no Islam is not like that no no I have to correct your misconception you've got this wrong and we spend our time instead of displaying our religion as we're supposed to we just defending things so every time they throw something at us we try to be defensive we ignore them there is so much bigger fish to fry number one number two when they say deviate deviate deviant things like this we say okay for example if I were to reply let me go back to the Hadith you're referring to and see is it authentic it checks the first box it is authentic what is meant by it h how do I know should I go to the Deviant sects no I should go to the scholars of Early Times who did not have the them ideas of the Deviant sects or the super sufis or the Shia no no no the real Scholars of the Early times I go and check with Imam an nawi I go and check with with I ha with IB Tam I go with I rajab I go even earlier times than that and see what is meant by n in Arabic and read history where did all them calamities them earthquakes them Wars against Islam the Moguls the blah blah blah where did it come from and what is named and what is called n according to Medina where the Prophet said thisi huh is it different of course NJ is a higher ground and it is to the east different from NJ from mecca for example so you have to see what the historians say what the people of Arabic language say and what the scholars interpret this Hadith and when you do that when you do your due diligence you will find this this Hadith fits as a glove first because the area of NJ to the people of Medina is Iraq and the adjacent area Iran and so forth this is their n this is the high grounds of the people of Medina this is what they used to call n throughout history where did all the fitan all the fan originated from from that region what fitna came from the middle of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia show me what FNA what tribulation what wars what fights against Islam so when they say wahhabis what are they referring to any not student of knowledge any Layman would immediately identify that they're referring toed which the super sufis the super Shia the ra all the Deviant sects fight they don't want and this is the essence of the messages of all prophets and messengers of Allah along other things but as I said why even care about what they say these guys are not known to be Scholars to be people of knowledge they're not known to be righteous and Pious people so why should we throw a stone at every dog that barks leave them focus on learning Quran focus on learning your Sunnah and knowing the biography of the Prophet focus on learning your of of the beautiful names of Allah and his attributes then you'll be safe and heading to Jenna inshallah uh"
