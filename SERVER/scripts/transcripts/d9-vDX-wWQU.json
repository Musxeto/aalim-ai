  "transcript": "Abdullah from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh I keep hearing this voice in my head telling me to do good things but it's like exaggerating I'm like doing very excess of good things such as such as it tell me to clean plates like dishes do dishes and tell me to do stuff like exaggerating stuff so doing plates is not a good deed it's a permissible permissible deed if you're helping your mom that's good but if it tells you to go and knock on neighbors doors and say hi would you like me to wash the dishes that's insane first of all second of all you have to analyze are these thoughts getting you closer to Allah or getting you further from Allah in the sense that could Shaytan tell me to do something good the answer is yes how is that you see when he whispered to Adam peace be upon him he told him to eat from the forbidden tree on the hope that he would become immortal he lives he will live forever that's a good thing so this is how Shaytan works so may Shaytan may come to me and say this is a Christian woman blonde blue eyes she's a bombshell why don't you go and call her for Islam I think to myself calling for Islam is a good thing yes Shaytan is telling me to call her for Islam or to accept Islam but this is not his main goal his main goal that I fall into fitnah that I cross the red lines that I do what angers Allah now at this particular moment Shaytan may put some fog in front of my eyes so that I wouldn't see the truth and I would only see that calling someone to Islam so you have to look into these whispers in your head if they're getting you closer to Allah or they're so extreme that you think that in couple of days it would make you divert and leave Islam a little bit or say that no this is too much I don't want to pray in the masjid anymore if these whispers tell you let's go to the masjid couple of hours before fajr read quran do tahajjud that's a good thing but if you know yourself that if you do this for couple of days you'll skip fajr on the third day because you're so tired you're so asleep and you think of oh two hours before fajr no let me go to bed and wake up five minutes before fajr and you end up losing fajr then this is how you evaluate thing and you you are the best judge of yourself not others"
