  "title": "Dog's Impurity & Using The Same Washing Machines as NonMuslims | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sister Zahra from Indonesia. Okay, my first question is, is it permissible to wash clothes in the same washing machine that was used by non-Muslims? Because their clothes might have saliva of their dogs. Okay, first of all, what's the ruling on washing clothes that were licked by dogs or that contain dogs' saliva? The hadith talks about utensils that dogs may eat from or lick. So the Prophet said, Alayhis salatu Wassalam, if a dog eats or licks food or drinks from a utensil, then you have to spill what's in it, wash it seven times and dust it once. So in the beginning, you wash it with soil or dust, then you wash it seven times with water. Some scholars cascaded this even if the dog were to lick your hand or your trousers. But this is not what the Prophet said, Alayhis salatu Wassalam. And the most authentic opinion is that washing seven times and one with soil is only when the dog uses the utensils. A plate, a bowl, a spoon, this is what we have to use seven times. As for normal clothes or when a dog comes and licks your hand, it just happens in kafir countries, a dog can just come and lick your hand. So what should I do? You just wash it normally without any problem. So coming to your question, there is no problem in washing these clothes in the same washing machine as it will be overwhelmed with water. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
