  "transcript": "F Shan says a group of women or men in our society make ABC group I don't know what B C group is but you guys made me know that we're 12 months for 12 months each person will pay one thousand dirhams and each month randomly a name will be selected by a draw or fix a month on each person so each one gets 12,000 amount each month is this allowed well this is known as cooperative scheme of not lending but rather on saving money so twelve of us one for every month we put from month one eight thousand dirham so I individually will put 11 months 1000 1000 1000 fixed on the 12-month I will collect 11 from everyone else in addition to the thousand I'm supposed to put but I'm not gonna put it because it's mine and I take the money in this scheme each one of the twelve thousand would only receive what he had put in all would be considered to have put in after the year is over because the first person who takes eleven thousand plus his that's twelve thousand he did not put any penny yet but from the second month till the 12th month he'll be injecting one thousand month a month like everyone else this is totally permissible and halal because there is no loan and there is no interest it is a sort of a saving scheme so that I don't waste my money but by committing to them to give them a thousand a month and there's thing wrong in that insha allah azzawajal"
