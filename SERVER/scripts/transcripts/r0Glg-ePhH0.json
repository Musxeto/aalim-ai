  "title": "Prophet Ayyub Patience and Reward",
  "transcript": "Remember finally that Prophet Ayub, peace be upon him, mentioned in the Qur'an and also mentioned in the Sunnah. Scholars say that for 18 years he was afflicted by an illness, that even his own people abandoned him and they were disgraced of him. And he lost his children and wealth, only his wife stayed beside him. For 18 years, and he is not any Tom, Dick or Harry, he is a Prophet of Allah. The closest a person could reach to be to Allah Azza Wa Jal is a Prophet or a Messenger. Yet Allah kept this illness and calamity with all its trauma for 18 years. Did he despair? Did he feel discontent? Never. And after 18 years, Allah gave him the whole world. Locusts made of gold and silver fell over him that filled barns and barns to substitute him for his wealth. Gold and silver, not nuggets, locusts coming in the millions. So Allah substituted him with offspring, with wealth for his patience. So be patient and Allah Azza Wa Jal will soon insha'Allah answer your prayers."
