  "title": "Student dependent on his family, can he fast 3 days to expiate Oath",
  "transcript": "My question is someone who is dependent on his family, does he, does he can, can he fast for three days for expiation of breaking an oath or he have to feed ten people or cloth ten people? What are you asking about? Are you asking about expiating a broken oath? Yes. And you don't have financial means to feed or cloth ten people? Yes, because I am financially dependent on my father. Okay, okay. If a person is totally independent, is totally dependent on his parents, he has no savings, no income, he has no financial means to feed or cloth ten poor people, the answer is if you break an oath, you have to fast three days and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
