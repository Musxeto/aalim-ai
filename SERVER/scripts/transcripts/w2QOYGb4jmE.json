  "transcript": "Who is this? – Assalamu Alaikum - Wa'laykumussalam What can I do for you?\nActually, I wanted to ask a question, as we know  It is not permitted to write \nsomething Kufr in an exam except if it means we are not able to pass the exam. So actually, in our syllabus, there is something called the meeting of Non-Mahram. There is nothing romantic. This is an exam, whether it is historical, \nnovel, facts of history or a fictional thing. As long as it is an exam and they tell you to find \nthe answer and give the answer to questions they   are giving even if it contains Non-Mahram \nrelationships or something that is Haram, you’re compelled to do it and you are not \nhaving any conviction or belief in it, rather you’re resenting it, \nthere is no problem in that Insha Allah."
