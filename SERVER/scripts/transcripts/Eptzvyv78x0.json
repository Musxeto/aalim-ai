  "transcript": "from bangladesh he says that i downloaded a number of books one of them is for free but i don't know about the others this issue is problematic now if these are books and they are for learning and they are freely available in the net i did not hack i did not break any code or rights it's just there i downloaded it to read it not to make money out of it rather to benefit from it and it's there it's it's on the internet the one who did it is the one who broke it or stole it or whatever so to me it seems like going to the library and finding a book and taking it and reading it and then returning it downloading such books for reading only seems to be the same thing as long as i did not participate in breaking any laws and allah knows best"
