  "transcript": "[Music] says in the subcontinent we have functions before the wedding called haldi and mehindi where women apply turmeric to the bride and on me hindi night they apply hinna and have a get together and it's very common amongst muslims for or from many many years is this permissible generally speaking the default is that such gatherings and celebrations are permissible unless they go against an islamic principle or they are imitating the disbelievers and their customs and traditions so if this practice is being done by the muslims all of them in the subcontinent and they do not involve music dancing or free mixing which is in most cases if it does not involve anything haram and it does not involve rituals of the hindus this is permissible so healthy for example or haldi is usually applying turmeric paste which is mixed with rose water or with milk or with different cultures depending on what what they use and they put it on the face the um the neck the chest and the arms of the both the boy and the girl and it supposed to be detoxifying impact releases the stress removes that cells of the body and it makes a person glow this is hella if this is what it is used for no music no free mixing which is hopefully the case but if it involves hindu rituals thinking that after this process a bride or a groom must not leave the house except to the wedding for fear of the evil eye or if they tie a red thread and this is common or use forms of amulets to prevent evil eye and this is also common this is shirk this is totally prohibited and it falls under imitating the disbelievers if they have this concept of if the groom would apply some of it to his cousins or siblings who are not married they will get married soon as a form of a good luck a good luck gesture this is haram and it's imitating the hindus and so on mahindi are applying for decoration this is only applicable for women so if it is to beautify the bride only in women's circle without exposing any aura without any music without anything haram again this is permissible inshallah it all depends on the circumstances on the knee and on what goes on and allah azza knows best you"
