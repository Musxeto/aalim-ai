  "transcript": "[Music] says can we keep hamsters as pets the prophet allah is to kill five types of animals whether we find them in the hill area which is out of the haram or inside the haram and he also ordered us in different hadith to kill mice because a mouse is a type of an animal that is evil by nature and it carries a lot of diseases and the plague is one of them among others and it's known to be destructive and with evil intent even it may take a piece of thread and get it burnt from or set it on fire from a candle or fire in the house and take that thread and burn the whole house with it so mice are evil and we are ordered in islam to kill them a hamster is very similar to mice it looks like mice and as they say it's about 86 to 90 species of mice that are found there so a hamster is a rodent and it falls under the same category of mice and hence it is not permissible to keep them as pets because of the instruction of the prophet to kill them wherever we find them and to dispose of them you"
