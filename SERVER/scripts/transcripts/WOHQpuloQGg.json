  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum. He said the last question. Alaykumussalam. This is the last question. Okay. Anyone with last questions as well? Yes sir. This is the last question. Okay. Sheikh, it's about Istikhara. Istikhara, how is it done? Are there specific readings you are supposed to read? What time are you supposed to pray? And how will you know if it is answered? Or how will you know if whatever you are asking is right or wrong? Would you like me to also describe Eid prayer? One question, Sheikh. You are making a lecture now. In a nutshell, Istikhara, what is it? It is asking Allah to facilitate this. Not to choose which one to take. I have an interest of buying a car. Ya Allah, should I buy the 911S Porsche? Or should I go for the Ferrari Roma? I don't know. Ya Allah. I am hesitant. I don't know which one to take. So I say I pray Istikhara and ask Allah. It doesn't work. This is not right. Huh? Istikhara is to make a decision. Okay. 911 is a practical car. It's a day-to-day car. I can go to work. I can go to ledger. It has launch control. It's an excellent rating. It's the best car. I'm going to take 911. I made my mind. Now I pray two rak'ahs Istikhara. What do I do? The two rak'ahs must be from out of the fard. It has to be voluntary. After praying two rak'ahs, I raise my hands and I do the dua. Which you know in the fortress of Muslim translates to, O Allah, praising Allah, praising Allah. Then if buying the 911S is good for me in this dunya and in the hereafter in all of my affairs, O Allah, facilitate it for me. And if not, O Allah, decline it and put something better for me and make me satisfied, make my heart happy with it. I go to the showroom with my checkbook. I'm determined. I want to buy this car. Welcome. They bring me coffee. The coffee is cold. No problem. And after that, I want the car to be in gray color. I said, Oh, gray color? We don't have it in stock. We have red. But gray color, you have to wait six months. What will happen to me? I don't know. Six months? Crazy. I'll go to the next showroom. I'll get a red Ferrari Roma, number one. This is my Istikhara's answer. Oh, you don't have to see a vision, a dream? No. Don't I have to see a window open from the heavens and lanterns and coming down or something? Do I have to see a sign? Because when I'm going to the agency of the car, I saw a dead cat. So this is my Istikhara answer. All of this is nonsense. There is nothing as Istikhara answer. You're asking Allah. If there's good in it, facilitate it. Allah did not facilitate it. It's not good for you. OK? Last question? I don't know. Ask them. Don't ask me. They will kick me out."
