  "transcript": "Brother Zuhaib from Pakistan. Okay Sheikh, my question is regarding the hadith that the woman is married for four reasons, either her beauty, her wealth, her lineage or her deen and of course the best one is who chooses her for her deen. But the other three, preferring a woman from the other three is also allowed. So as far as marrying a woman for wealth is concerned, then what if a person starts depending on his wife's income or wealth instead of providing her, he expects her to provide him. Is that allowed? First of all, the hadith tells us about what is happening, not what is recommended. And this doesn't mean that it is okay. Like when the Prophet ﷺ tells us about the Dajjal, the Antichrist, and what mischief he would do when he comes. It is not a seal of approval, but this is what's going to happen. So usually, in men, individuals may be attracted to a woman due to her wealth. He's a gold digger. He's looking for a sugar mummy. Or for her beauty, he's a normal man. Or for her lineage, he wants to have power and authority and have pride among the people. Or for her religious practice, the Prophet ﷺ recommended to take the woman with the religious practice. Now if she's from a good family and she's rich and she's beautiful, you've got it made. Alhamdulillah. A man who marries a woman for her wealth, he's a gold digger. And this means that he's not a real man. No real man would accept or would expect his wife to chip in the expenses. And I get lots of counseling sessions from the US, Canada, and Europe of women saying that we work a job or two jobs, and we support the family, we chip in the expenses, we pay for the rent, and some of them say, my husband doesn't work at all, and I do all the expenses. This is not a real man. This is a wimp. This is someone who biologically can be male, but is not a real man. And I'm sorry if you're offended, sue me. A real man does not allow his wife to chip a penny, even if she's a multi-millionaire, because he has his pride. He would not dream of a nightmare that one day she would say in a fight to him, didn't I give you? Didn't I pay for you? Didn't I do this and that for you? This is the worst nightmare a real man could face. But people who are not men, there are so many of them, and they're cheaper by the dozen. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me, and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
