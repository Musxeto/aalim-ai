  "transcript": "Arise from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I'm Pakistani and in Pakistan people quote a Hadith I'm not sure if it's authentic or not but they say Prophet ﷺ told us to do innovations which can benefit the Muslim Ummah for example reading Durood on Miladun Nabi is this true and can I do this Jazakallahu Khairan No this is not true this is a complete lie and a fabrication and we have a lot of Hadiths that are fabricated and that are not authentic or weak that serves the agenda of other people so it serves the agenda of the super Sufis, it serves the agenda of the Rafida it serves the agenda of innovators who do not have any shame or regret from fabricating Hadith and lying and when you face them they say we did not lie upon the Prophet ﷺ rather we lied for his sake so that we would draw people closer A'udhu Billah this is not Islam, a different religion Islam Alhamdulillah has been protected and will be protected by Allah it is preserved till the day of judgement through the Quran and the authentic Sunnah and with the grace of Allah we have scholars that know what is authentic and what is not and they clarify this to us they show us this is a science and it's not anything to do with priesthood or anything secret, this is all known to all with the grace of Allah Azzawajal"
