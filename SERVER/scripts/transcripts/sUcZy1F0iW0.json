  "title": "Ruling on eating cheese if the source of the rennet is not known | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Holly is asking about cheese from animals slaughtered the non-halal way is it permissible I know their meat is forbidden but what about the cheese for example can we eat a cheese only pizza or a vegetable pizza from a shop that sells non halal food if I understand the question correctly adi is asking about the rennet or known in arabic as a envy ha if I understand this correctly to make cheese you have to add some of this rennet so it makes the milk a little becomes solid and usually this rennet is white yellowish substance taken from the stomach of an infant sheep or cow so it is not if it was slaughtered then we have no problem but the vast majority would not slaughter it so the scholars differed into two factions the vast majority of them say it's not Helen because it's obtained from a dead meat a dead animal which renders it as nudges the Hanafi school of thought and it's an opinion of the ham belly school of thought say it's ok and each have and each has their own justification I personally feel that it is permissible and the reason is that at the time of the Prophet Allah so the Companions used to consume buy and eat the cheese that they buy from the fire worshippers and from the Christians and from the Jews without any problem and no one has ever stated that this is not halide and hence it seems that this is an exemption and al hamdulillah as long as there is an opinion and the the majority of Muslims consume it I insha'Allah there is no problem in that and illogical knows best"
