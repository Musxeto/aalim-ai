  "transcript": "And the second one, Sheikh. Some said that, oh, this is the Sheikh who said to kill kuffar or kafirun. How do you say, Sheikh? This is a blatant lie, because anyone who says, kill the disbelievers or attack them or be violent to them, would be incarcerated and put in jail immediately. And Alhamdulillah, all my teachings, all my courses, my lessons are online and videotaped, audiotaped. The Prophet, and just to show you how big liars these people are, the Prophet said, Alayhis salatu Wassalam, whoever kills a Christian or a Jew who has the pledge, meaning he has a visa, he is a resident, he has diplomatic ties with our country, whoever kills a Jew or a Christian will not find the scent, the fragrance of paradise, though the fragrance of paradise is detected 40 years traveling distance, meaning he will not get close to paradise. So any Muslim who cannot get close to paradise would not be considered a real true Muslim. So this shows you the gravity and the seriousness of killing the Jews and the Christians. How do they dare say that we encourage people to do that? It's very funny. It's not logical. And I believe they don't see the context. Okay, they also, some say that you have that verse in the Quran, in Surat At-Tawbah, that to kill the kafir or the kafirun, but actually behind that verse, there is a context, because of the maybe some agreement by the Prophet and the Quraysh, and after a few months or after some certain condition, the verse is there because they broke the agreement, right? Correct. Can you please clarify? This verse they're referring to is one in thousands of different verses of the Quran. It's in chapter nine in the very beginning. It's talking about a conflict between the Muslims and the idol worshippers that had been going on for 20 years or so. And they have killed a lot of the Muslims. They have oppressed them. They have confiscated their wealth, their houses, their property. And they forced them to migrate and leave their own hometown to other countries. So Allah tells us or tell them that there shall be a truce and a treaty for a period of time. Yes, a certain period. Yes, four months period. After this truce, whenever you find them, kill them. So this is not for any Muslim to kill any disbeliever, because even at the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him, in Medina, after this verse was mentioned, there were Jews living, there were Christians living, there were idol worshippers living, but they did not fight Islam or show and express animosity against the Muslims. That verse is on a specific or for specific people in certain conditions. Yes, thank you so much. It's now clear for us."
