  "transcript": "Kim Heng from Cambodia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, so I reverted to Islam Alhamdulillah when I went for an exchange program in Malaysia. Now that I'm back in Cambodia, it's a Buddhist country, I just have the guts to tell my family about my reversion and the result is they absolutely against it and now I don't know what else to do. I just pretended that I left Islam for my, for the sake of my dad's health and now there's like a, there's a ghost festival in Buddhist where people go to pagoda and they will force me to pray to worship our ancestor and the Buddhist god so I don't know what step I should take. No, this is totally wrong of you to do and may Allah Azza Wa Jal forgive your sin. How dare you pretend that you went back on Islam and accepted Buddhism once again? This is apostasy and kufr. Even if it was your father's health, it, your reverting to kufr would not help him. He's gonna die, he's gonna die, whether with you or without you. So you cannot compromise your belief as a Muslim and say, okay, they're forcing me to pray to our ancestors, they're forcing me to go to the temple, they're forcing me, tomorrow they're going to force you to take off your clothes and your underwear. Are you going to do this? He said, no, of course not, sheikh. I said, okay, so what's the limit? Where is your red line? No, you have to be proud of your religion. Whoever wants to accept you, alhamdulillah, if they don't want to accept you, go back to Malaysia and continue to study and work there and leave them alone."
