  "title": "Husband only provides food & neglects care during pregnancy, can wife take Khula or refuse intimacy?",
  "transcript": "Khalilullah from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So the question I'm asking a question on behalf of a sister so she said she has a husband and the husband doesn't take care of the children and herself by you know she said the husband provide food but what she wears what the student what the children wears she doesn't know the husband doesn't provide that she was not asking if it's permissible for her to compel or to ask her husband and also she mentioned that whenever she gets pregnant the husband doesn't look after her you know she doesn't he doesn't go to the hospital with her and she was not asking either it's possible or permissible for her to compel her husband to probably do you know something that could prevent her getting pregnant or is this enough reason for her to file for hulu or to avoid or to you know prevent or deny the husband intimacy so the scholars relate the obligation of a wife to give her husband her his rights of intimacy they relate it to the husband being able to provide for his wife so if the husband does not provide for his wife the normal the bare minimum then she has the right to refrain from giving him his rights of intimacy now she said that he gives her a food and he provides her with a roof on their head but he doesn't pay for her clothes this is problematic what does he mean if throughout the whole year he doesn't buy them clothes for her and for her children no this is something that she is she has all the right to demand and compel him by force and even if she has to go to court that he has to give her enough money that within reason to buy whatever is necessary for her for a whole year of course not a whole wardrobe but according to the norm and the judges know what is sufficient for that and not taking her to hospital or being with her when she is giving birth this is not a reason for hulu or for divorce so many men may be frightened may be busy may be negligent but they're providing for their wives and they're caring for the children etc when it comes to hospital they're too lazy or they have a reason here or there this is not a legitimate right and allah knows best"
