  "transcript": "We have Sister Alima from France Assalamu Alaikum Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Yes, sometimes I know things that are mandatory or non-mandatory or major and minor knowledge in worshipping Allah SWT and I am unable to practice them and sometimes I get humiliated for them, so I try to reassure myself that Allah is aware of everything, both for the human beings and the jinns. Am I sinful if I continue to tell you for counselling, each times it happens? Are you sinful if you do what? If I continue to tell you each times I get humiliated for the knowledge I know about or I can know, but I get humiliated for it because I was unable to practice them each time, so each time it happens I do call you, I do tell you to have counselling session about it. Am I sinful for it each time it happens? This is part of Allah's testing. Now if you look at the life of the Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, the first 13 years in Mecca, he was insulted, he was humiliated, he was accused of being a sorcerer, a liar, a madman, a poet and a soothsayer. And they attacked him physically, they abused him verbally and they tortured his companions. This is part of Allah's testing to all of us because we are all being tested. As long as you're abiding by the Qur'an and the sunnah and trying your level best to minimise damages and to be diplomatic with others, yet still they're abusing you for being committed to Islam, alhamdulillah, this is a glad tiding from Allah that your place in Jannah is being prepared and that you are doing the right thing because you are following the footsteps of the Prophet alayhi as-salatu was-salam."
