  "title": "Imam is too fast and I can't recite the whole Tashahhud, if I don't get time to say durood, valid?",
  "transcript": "Aska from Indonesia. Yes. I almost always pray behind the imam whose second tashahud is so short that I don't have enough time to recite the whole tashahud. Sometimes the imam ends the salat right right when I get to the salawat or even before it. If I just end my salat even if I can only recite Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ala Ali Muhammad and then salam, is my prayer valid? It's an issue of dispute whether the second sitting and the salutation upon the Prophet alayhis salatu wassalam, the salutation itself Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ala Ali Muhammad till the end, is it mandatory or not? There are three views. Some say it's sunnah so even if you neglect it there's no problem. Some say it's mandatory and some say it's a pillar and the most authentic opinion I'm inclined to is that it is mandatory. So if the imam offers salam and you had not completed it yet, no problem, complete it even if you're five ten seconds late from the salam and then I'll offer your salam without a problem."
