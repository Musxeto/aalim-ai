  "transcript": "Madina from Germany Madina from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Okay, so can one give the money they earned in a haram way to a charity organization that takes some percent of the money for themselves? Or does the charity organization need like a 100% policy? As long as a person is cleansing his wealth from haram and giving it to a charity organization, the charity organization by default has to sustain their business and able to work and deliver the money to the needy and to the poor. There is no problem in them taking a percentage of that and Allah knows best."
