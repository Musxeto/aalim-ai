  "transcript": "that was built during the ottoman empire it has pieces of hajjar and should these pieces be returned to mecca do you think that i'm in a position to number one believe what is being said that there are pieces of the black stone in a masjid in turkey how would i know how would i verify oh they say that these things are from the black stone they say in top copy or in their museums that this is the fakkar's uh sword of the prophet hassam this is his helmet and this is his cloak and this is his blanket and all of this is not true so number one we have to verify this number two should it be returned and this is something if we're to be proven to be true definitely this belongs to the black stone the hajj al-aswad which is in mecca which is in el caba if this is true refusing to return it would be i don't even think that a crime would fit the severity and how horrendous such an act is because no muslim would refuse to return what is belonging to the house of allah the kaaba the black stone but again these are allegations and we muslims don't go down to that level of fights and quarrels that is dirty and un-islamic these things are for the scholars of islam to discuss and to verify and to request and then they can judge these things but not us layman and allah azza knows best i am you"
