  "transcript": "Surafeel from U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam. What's your name? Surafeel. Surafeel. Okay. I was wondering if you can make ta'ammum if you're running late for your salah and making wudu would make you miss your salah. I was wondering if it's possible to do that. If a person wakes up like a minute before sunrise and he estimates that if he makes wudu he will miss one rak'ah and hence the salah would be out of the time. So he asks, is it permissible for me to make ta'ammum which takes a couple of seconds and I can pray? The answer is no. This is not permissible. You must perform your ghusl or your wudu as it was prescribed. Ta'ammum for the fear of the time coming out is not a legitimate reason. And if you are, as I've described, someone who woke up late, there is no sin on you even if the sun rises or the time expires and Allah knows best."
