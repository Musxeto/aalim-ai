  "transcript": "Abu Yussef says that before sleeping we know that we should recite specific sewers such as surat al-mulk surat ar-rahman first of all our man is not part of the bed earth car so there isn't any authentic hadith that recommends us to read Surat al-rahman on regular basis it's a beautiful surah no doubt it explains to us the beauty of Jannah and the description of Jannah but there isn't any authentic hadith none whatsoever that recommends reciting it whether before sleeping or when a woman is pregnant and is about to deliver or when a woman is single and once a righteous spouse all of this is not authentic so what are the suitors that it is highly recommended to recite before sleeping surat al-mulk tabarak ella debe ad hill milk this is well known to everybody 30 ayahs the Prophet said Alice a lot Sam that it intercedes for the reciter in his grave if he recites it before going to bed and we also know that whoever memorizes it Allah will protect him from Hellfire and there is surat stage de Alif LAAM Meem there is also surrett as umar and so rotten ezra very Israel the Prophet used to recite this before going to bed salallahu alaihe wa use in them now the question is if a person does not memorize these sewers in this case there is no problem in reading them while lying down on his bed so holding the most half the Quran you lie on your bed normally and you read it there is no disrespect for the Quran in this at all because our prophet used to lie in the lap of mother aisha and recite the Quran and in some narrations that was is in her menses so this is not disrespecting the Quran and if a person is unable to read it because of his vision or eyesight in this case listening to it and repeating behind the person who recites it is or acts as if you have read it yourself without a problem insha Allah"
