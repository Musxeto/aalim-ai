  "title": "Why is it permissible for women to look at men? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "likewise there is no problem in watching Scholars on your mobile or your laptop as videos because women are allowed to look at men as long as there is no fitna as long as they're not tempted but men are not allowed to look at women whether they are tempted or not they're ordered to lower their gaze but women that is why women wear hijab and men don't because women walk in the street and they can see men without a job and no problem as long as the vast majority would not be tempted or have any fitna while the opposite is true men are always tempted it's something in their genes it's something built in them that they're drawn like a magnet to the opposite gender"
