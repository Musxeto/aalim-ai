  "transcript": "Yassar from Lichtenstein, Lichtenstein, I don't know how it's pronounced. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu, Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam. How do you pronounce your country? Lichtenstein. Lichtenstein, Jawohl. What can I do for you? I have a question, please. Yes. So, in my school, I have a female teacher and I didn't give her the hand because I told her, I'm sorry, I can't because of my religion. And she doesn't got it, like… She doesn't feel good about it. Yeah, and she told me that I discriminate women because I don't do it, but I told her I do it because I respect the woman. And I do, when I greet my mother, I kiss her hand, I kiss her feet. I do, I love my, I love women, I love my mother. And I feel very lonely and alone when this happens. Like, when they get it wrong, I feel like alone. Okay. So, what's the question? What, like, do you have advice what to do when they… Advice is very easy, Yassar. The advice is very easy. Akhi, there is nothing that you will do that will make them happy with you. وَلَن تَرْضَ عَنْكَ الْيَهُودُ وَلَا النَّصَارُ They will never be pleased with you, the Jews and the Christians, until you follow their religion. So, no matter what you do, no matter how much you compromise, they will be fine with it. So, with all due respect, if you guys don't respect my religion, to hell with you. I could care less what happens. So, they claim that this is discrimination. What? Not to shake hands? No, it's not discrimination. In my country, tell her, in my religion, you don't have to tell her this, but see the mindset. In my country and my religion, men shake hands with men, they embrace them and they kiss each other on the cheek. You want me not to discriminate? Well, this is inappropriate. In Spain, kissing on the cheek with the opposite gender is normal. Is it accepted in your religion or in your culture? No, no, no, just only shaking hands. And so, there are barriers, there are boundaries, there are customs that you respect. Why don't you respect mine? And, at the end of the day, I could care less how you feel. What counts to me as a Muslim is I follow what my Lord and my God tells me to do. And I don't care about what any person else thinks. So, remain steadfast, the ayahs are. And imagine how did the Prophet ﷺ, how the Prophet ﷺ felt when he called the idol worshippers and they abused him and accused him of being a sorcerer, an insane person, a magician, a poet, a priest and the likes, and a liar. He felt also the same way you feel, but this did not deter him or stop him. Rather, it empowered him and it gave him strength because he's doing the right thing. May Allah make us all steadfast on Islam."
