  "transcript": "Next question, what advice would you give to the youngsters of today? Fear Allah. Akhi, come on, you want a realistic answer? Ask a realistic question. What is the advice you give to the youngsters today? Be kind to your parents. Study well. Make a lot of money. Stay away from haram. Try to memorize the Quran. Observe your salah in the first row. Make a lot of dhikr. Don't imitate the kuffar. Don't watch movies and listen to music. The sky is the limit, what do you want me to say? Ask a specific question, because when you ask a generic question, you can't answer it except with a generic answer."
