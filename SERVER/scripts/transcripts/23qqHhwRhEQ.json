  "transcript": "if i join the imam while he is reciting fatiha should i say the dua of alistaifter while he is reciting it the inaugurational dua [Music] etc this is a confirmed sunnah for every prayer other than the funeral prayer of course and it is recommended for you to recite it if there is enough time but if you came late and the imam is reciting his fatiha it's an issue of dispute i'm inclined to the opinion that says you should not recite it you just joined the congregation by saying allahu akbar and listen to the fatiha because it is not permissible for you to recite the while the imam is reciting his fatiha and the fatih is a pillar therefore what's lesser than a pillar which is a recommended sunnah would be by default not permissible to recite either if the imam pauses between the fatiha and following surah like so many imams do though this is not from the sunnah and it is wrong for the imam after saying i mean he pauses for like 10 12 giving the people behind him a chance to recite the fatiha this is wrong this is not from the sunnah the prophet never paused this much but if your imam had done this in this case if you think that the time is sufficient for you to read the inauguration then go ahead and do it and that's okay insha'allahu as what you"
