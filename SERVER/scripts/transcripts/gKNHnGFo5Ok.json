  "title": "Can I recite Surah Fatiha ALONGSIDE the Imam? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Omar from the UK. So my question is when I'm praying with the Imam Fajr Maghrib and Isha and he's reading out loud and I know that you can listen and you don't need to recite anything but what about if I want to recite surah Fatiha and my surah when would I recite it? So the answer would be you cannot recite the Fatiha while the Imam is reciting it. So when he says Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen you say Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen. This is not permissible. What is permissible is when he concludes his Fatiha by saying Ghayrul Maghdoobu Alayhim Wa Raddalleen Ameen you say Ameen and you begin reciting the Fatiha. If he starts to recite the following surah there's no problem you can also continue to recite your Fatiha quickly conclude it and then listen to it. If you don't recite the Fatiha at all according to the most authentic opinion your prayer is totally valid because his recitation in loud rak'as is sufficient for himself and for you as well. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you. If you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
