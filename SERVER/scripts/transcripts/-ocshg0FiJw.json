  "title": "Praying & Finding Impurity on Clothes, Prayer Valid?",
  "transcript": "uh Benjamin from Bosnia uh uh so if a person does a voodo and is certain that there is uh no impurities on him he goes to Masjid and prays his prayers without having any feeling or evidence that something that he that something came out and then comes back home so in total like 20 25 minutes uh from making wodoo he he then finds out that there is impurity in his underwear are his prayers valid or should he repeat his prayers again so we have an issue here Benjamin the issue number one is that the certainty that I have performed wo and my underwear is clean when I prayed this is certain now the doubt comes 25 5 minutes after I finish my prayer so we have a rule that states certainty is not affected by doubt which means when I was certain that I was pure this certainty remains exactly as in the Hadith where the Prophet once wasam prayed in congregation he was the IM while wearing his sandals and the companions behind him were all wearing their sandals and by the way this is a Sunnah if you're wearing your sandals and the place is accepting that that you wear shoes and pray with your shoes or pray in your sandals or because the prophet said pray in your sandals or your slippers for the Jews do not pray in their sandals so the prophet is telling us that this is okay however if you go to the Masjid and it's all carpets and you enter with your shoes on the worshippers would be irritated and angry and probably would cause problems for you so don't do this because you will make the Clean Carpet dirty with your shoes not NES dirty but if you're in an airport or if you are in a lounge or if you are in a mall and you want to pray pray with your shoes on so the prophet led the prayer with his shoes on in the middle of the prayer he took them off so the companions all took their took their shoes off after the prayer was over the prophet turned around and said to them why did you take your shoes off they said you took your shoes off we take our shoes off you pray with them on we pray with them on We are following everything you do oh prophet of Allah sallallah alaih wasallam so he said jiel the Archangel came to me while I was in prayer telling me that there is a NASA in the soil of my shoes so I took them off now what do we learn number one it is not permissible to pray with NASA on your clothes number two whatever prayer that was done with an impurity on your clothes the prayer is valid if you did not know because the prophet did not break his Salah and started it all over again no the two Ras or three raas that he had prayed with soiled shoes with shoes with NASA were valid coming back to your question your prayer is valid because this NASA could have come out in these 25 minutes of your time after the Salat as we do not have certainty the certain thing is your prayer was done in a correct voodo and in the state of Purity so no need to doubt this and Allah Knows Best"
