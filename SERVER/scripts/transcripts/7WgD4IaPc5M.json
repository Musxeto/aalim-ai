  "transcript": "Muhammad from Sri Lanka Hello, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, quick question. So I am from Sri Lanka and currently employed in the UAE. So my question is while sending the remittance to my country back, so it's very common to send it to unofficial channels which is like the other people in between to send the money. So there are negative effects for my country which is like this results in inflation and also these for the past two years my country has been hit with huge inflation. So I just want to know if so if I send it to these illegal channels I obviously I have an advantage. So I just want to check if I should remit the money to only official banks. We do not endorse anything that is illegal. So anything that goes against the laws of the country is haram. This is point number one. Point number two, transferring your money from one country to the other with exchanging the currency is not permissible unless the institution you're doing this with is something that has a credible weight such as a bank which is to be trusted. And the bank usually does the exchange instantaneously on the spot. So you give him dirhams, he converts it and he says okay this amount of dirhams will be transferred into this amount of rupees. I don't know what you guys use in Sri Lanka. And we will take 70 dirhams transfer charge. This is permissible because the exchange is done instantaneously. You authorize the bank to transfer. While in the case of this covert agent who's doing it secretly and illegally, you're giving him the dirhams and he is taking it through his own ways or through someone he knows there after two, three days and giving it to your family or to your friend. And this is not permissible. To make it permissible Islamically, you have to go to his office in Dubai, give him the dirhams while he's on the phone, while you're on the phone with your relative or your brother in Colombo in his office. So you say okay I'm giving him 10,000 dirhams and the guy there gives your brother the equivalent that you've agreed upon in rupees on the same spot. This is halal Islamically but it does not exempt you from the sin of breaking the law and Allah knows best. you"
