  "title": "If a Non-Mahram Female Gives Salam, is it Haram or Makrooh to Reply? Rejecting Al Nawawiâ€™s opinion?",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing wannabe from bangladesh i have two questions but as both are connected uh my question is if a non-maharan female gives salam is it haram to reply or maku if there is no mahram of mine or her around and my other question is al-nawawi in his book of atkar said that it is makru for men to reply so if i believe it is not mature it is a sin if i reject his opinion it's uh if you're gonna take me out of out of the whole of islam and now and now we are not allah so rejecting what he said would not be committing kufur because he's a great scholar of islam and he was opposed by many other scholars so rejecting his opinion is taking the other scholar's opinion and that would not be kufur so get the issue of kufr out of the way if a man or a woman gives salam to the opposite gender and there is no fitna there's no problem in returning and replying saying but if there is a fitnah if you're alone in seclusion and this bombshell comes in and she says the salaam alaikum and you look at them what the heck and you say no keep your salam to yourself and leave this is shaytan setting you for a trap and allah knows best you"
