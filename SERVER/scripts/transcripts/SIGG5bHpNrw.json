  "transcript": "Khadijah from Pakistan I have a question concerning major sin if someone commits the majors and consists like insists on it and does it openly like drinks alcohol it was a very good job and they do a lot of good deeds at the same time is it possible that their scale of Good Deeds can be higher is it also possible that if their bad Deeds are like the scale of batteries it's higher than the Good Deeds can Allah forgive them out of Mercy what I'm trying to say is that if someone insists on major sin does it openly and they die in that state are they still Muslims thanks okay first of all I think we addressed this yesterday or I've addressed it somewhere I'm not certain we have a scale on the day of judgment this scale the prophet told us that it has eyes and a tongue and it weighs either the good Deeds or the bad Deeds or it weighs your record books or it weighs the individual himself the person will be put in the scale and many times in the Quran Allah says to us that the weight is the truth and whatever outweighs would be the conclusion and the fate of the individual and we're told that Allah rewards one good deed tenfolds up to 700. and one bad deed as a single bad deed but we don't know which would be accepted from The Good Deeds so I come on the day of judgment I'm boasting about it I have a lot of good deeds and I come and find that I have nothing what is this is there is a mistake said no actually your good deeds were not for the sake of Allah so it's all gone down the way down the drain and then the big surprise is not something um nice to see so the norm is your good deeds and bad these are weight whether it's major sins whether it is not wearing the hijab dying while in the state of intoxication committing adultery backbiting stealing and embezzling people's wealth all of these are major bad Deeds or at the same time the person goes around every month he gives charity he sponsors orphans he offers night prayer and Etc this would be weighed on the day of judgment his faith is decided upon which overweighs this is the norm however there is always the Divine decree or the Divine will if Allah wills it he comes to all of these and he raises them as in the book where a man was brought up with 99 big record books of Bad Deeds and the guy reckoned that he's doomed and he's terrified so he's asked do you have any good deeds and the guy says no I don't think anything would come close to all of these sins and Allah says yes you have a good deed and you will not be wronged today there will be Justice and fairness and a card foreign is brought forward and placed in the scale so the man says what would this car do with all night these 99 records of bad Deeds Allah says you will not be treated unfairly today and the card overweighs all of his major and minor sins but this is up to the Divine will if Allah wills it it's done and you were are one of them uh the fortunate ones however we know that if Allah doesn't will it as in the elsewhere the prophet told us that Allah admitted a woman to Hell Fire why because she kept a kitten locked in her house without feeding her until it died she neither let the kitten go out to eat from whatever she could it could find nor this woman fed that kitten it simply locked her it out until it died so Allah punished her by admitting her to Hellfire people think that this is an easy thing and it's not that it's a kitten it's an animal so you never know how Allah azzawajal is going to treat us we're hopeful and we're wishful and we are counting on Allah's mercy and forgiveness but at the same time we do our level best to do as many Good Deeds as we can and to refrain and stay away from our sins as much as we can and we are hopeful and our fingers are Crescent with the grace of Allah foreign"
