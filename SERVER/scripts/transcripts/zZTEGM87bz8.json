  "title": "How to Deal with Apostate Family Members | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so he says how should we deal with family members who are pasta sized apostasy is leaving Islam it is rejecting Islam or committing something that nullifies Islam and people are either Muslims or non-muslims the non-muslims we have various categories called sects etc but for the Muslims who are practicing and do not nullify their Islam there are Muslims so what happens when a family member a pasta sizes commits the act of apostasy and becomes an apostate the answer is that you have to give him or her the benefit of the doubt try your level best to call them to back to Islam explain to them what they have misunderstood clarify their doubt etc if this does not work we cannot in this scenario coexist because now this person has committed something that is beyond acceptance in Islam and I believe that the best course of action is to boycott them to cut all communications with them and to let them be in order that may be they would think about it and come back to Islam in order to restore the relationships but if not then you have to dis communicate with them"
