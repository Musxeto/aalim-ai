  "transcript": "Sheikh, there is a question, it's a very funny question. Can I borrow the power of Allah against the world? Can you what? Borrow the power of Allah against the world? First of all, nobody borrows the power of Allah Azza Wa Jal because Allah is not your friend. He's not your neighbor. And this shows that these people don't know Allah. They do not estimate Allah's power as it's supposed to be. I don't know how can someone write such a question, but most likely they don't know English. So they wrote the wrong question. Maybe he meant, can I ask Allah Azza Wa Jal to give me power so that to rule against the world or to conquer the enemies of the world? Yes, you can make dua, but we don't speak about Allah Azza Wa Jal like we speak about one another. We have respect and honor and glorification for Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala."
