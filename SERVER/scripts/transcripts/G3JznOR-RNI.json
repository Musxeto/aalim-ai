  "transcript": "Next question is from sister [ ], in Islam do \nwe believe that gender is a social construct,   the school teaches that \ngender is a social construct. Is this is question? The question is that in Islam do we believe \nthat if gender is what people think that it is. I don't know what the question means \nunless, see whenever I hear the word gender   I immediately think of LGBTQ, so is she asking \nabout homosexuality or judging a gender by what   the people think rather of being a boy or \na girl, I don't know I can't understand, what I understand of the question \nis that in schools they teach it   that gender is up to you what you believe \nyou are, a male female or in between, so What is this? What is this nonsense? \nNo, no this is nonsense what such schools say or   convince their students with is un-Islamic \ntotally you're either a boy or a girl you're   either a male or a female and this is dependent \nupon your birth, point zero zero zero zero zero   zero one percent of the population which is one \nin every maybe 100 million might be mixed gender   by birth, having a uterus, having a male \nproductive organ, and at the same time,   this is something for the doctors to come and talk \nabout but when someone has male productive organs,   and he goes and says no I feel like a girl, I've \nalways been feeling like a female, I love barbie   and to play with barbie, I love makeups, I \nlove dresses, so we give him hormones, and we   chop off his merchandise, and we \ntry to make him be like a female,   no he's still a male even if he looks, sounds, \nfeels like a female he is still a male,   Allah created him a boy, a male, and he is still a \nmale he cannot go to pray with women, and he must   go and pray with men but with the way he looks he \ncannot pray with men so what would he, it needs a   tailored fatwa for him but at the moment this is \nwhere we stand, teachers must not say such rubbish   and nonsense to their students, a boy is a boy, a \ngirl is a girl and this is not for you to decide. Jazak Allahu Khairan Sheikh."
