  "title": "She's told, stop wearing your islamic attire if you don't have the right akhlaq, what should she do",
  "transcript": "she has tried herself to uh to wear the clothes like sharia unfortunately perhaps the the way he does the way she does uh it's not aligned with the other and sometimes it makes uh the people said like this you only wear like the sharia without a right and adapt so she might a bit confused with herself so what should she do okay basically this is one of the oldest traps and tricks of shaytan number one question is there anyone perfect on earth other than the prophet sallallahu alaihi yes or no no no yes nobody is perfect except the prophet isaiah this is what shaytan comes to me and he says oh you're a celebrity everybody knows you you're a huge uh superstar people love you you're a chef but they don't know what you do they don't see what you do when you're alone so you're a hypocrite and i say to myself when i hear these voices then what should i do so the voices say you have to be fair and truthful to yourself shave the beard why he says because when you shave the beard nobody would say that you are a practicing muslim and you lie or you cheat so i think to myself hmm he's right and this is where shaytan wins because you don't have knowledge you see lots of us have since and this is totally normal what yes it is totally normal this is human nature if i did not have sins i would not be human the prophet said allah is [Music] every single son of adam is sinful every single one of them the prophet goes on to say [Music] and the best of sinners are those who repent so if we repent to allah then we have fulfilled our obligation but to obey shaytan like this sister is saying so yes she's abiding by the full hijab she's a nikabi yet she may be rude she may lie she may be a little bit loud when we when she speaks to her parents or so shaytan comes to her and say being loud and being disrespectful to your parents is a major sin and you're wearing the hijab and the nihab and you think that you're a good muslim you're the worst of muslims and she says yeah you're right so what to do so instead of shaytan telling her you have to fear allah you have to be respectful to your parents you have to be polite you have to be kind you have to avoid lying instead he says no add to this taking off your hijab and not wearing islamic attire so instead of having only five sins he says add another one and why do you pray leave prayer so he is dragging your feet little by little until you become a full-fledged soldier of his my advice don't listen to him keep on abiding by the hijab and by the islamic attire because this pleases allah but at the same time try to fix the bad things in your character and to perfect yourself so that allah would love you more and more this is so enlightening uh even though i'm not the the acharya because i'm the man but i got the point i mean like yeah i hope you don't wear the hijab though yeah of course not enjoy no no no no no uh i mean like you"
