  "transcript": "Yasin from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, if one shares something haram like music or movies and TV shows, would he get a sin for every person that listens to that music or watches the TV show or movie because of him? And is repentance enough to make it stop? The Prophet ï·º answered you when he said, Translation, and whoever commits and is a guidance or a leader in sin, then he will have the burden of the sin and the burden of the sins of everyone who followed him till the day of judgment without any of their sins being deducted because he's being accredited to it. No, they will both have the same amount of sin and this is why the first son of Adam, peace be upon Adam, who committed the first murder and manslaughter crime in history, he will be accredited to every single murderer who commits the crime of killing as in the hadith. So, yes, it is a very grave sin to share, unfortunately, which a lot of the Muslims don't think of. They're mindless of it when they share haram on their platforms, social media platforms, on their Instagram, on their Snapchat, on their ex, previously known as Twitter, weird name, or Facebook, or the likes, and they share a video clip, a song, something that contains haram, thinking that it's fun, it's going to get me some likes, and yeah, it's cool. Not knowing that thousands, if not the hundreds of thousands, if not the millions of people who watch it, he will be accredited for every single sin. Whoa, man, this is a lot. This is why the people who work in media, those who act in movies, in soap operas, those who do talk shows that involve haram, those who sing, and those who compose, and those who write songs, and those who do this, and do all get the same amount of sin those followers are getting. They're accredited, but their sins remain intact, and they get a portion similar to it. For what? For fame and glory, Sheikh. We'd like to be recognized. We'd like to be known and famous. Okay, be famous for 50, 60 years. Then another one bites the dust. You'll go to hell. Watch out. You want to sin? Make it between you and Allah. Don't go around telling people, listen, I saw this movie last night. It's great, man. Here's the link. Here's a DVD. Here's this. Here's that. No, keep it between you and Allah, and be remorseful, and ask Allah for forgiveness. But when you continue to do these things, you will go down the drain pretty quick. Can we repent? Of course. Allah Azza wa Jal never blocks anyone from repenting. Try to, first of all, remove these links, and whatever you shared with others. Try to warn them. Try to take it from them, if you had given it to them physically, and whatever you can't reach, ask Allah for forgiveness, and feel remorseful, and Allah Azza wa Jal will forgive you."
