  "transcript": "mustafa from canada um so recently uh i've been having like uh confusions as i've been like seeing different views on something what is like the like what is considered free missing that is prohibited like it's for example it's like sitting like you're uh in a gathering that you're like uncles and their wives have kind of just considered how i'm premixing it if you're just sitting there or like what is considered in reality okay first of all the issue of free mixing is an issue that a lot of the muslims have great confusion over so they say why is free mixing haram and why are the muslims men and women going around the kaaba in the haram and doing say between safa and marwa and this is not prohibited why do women and men go to malls and supermarkets why do they sit in restaurants and buses and airplanes etc first of all all of these are not free mixing free mixing is when you get a chance to exchange glances knowing what is wrong and what is right this is a different thing looking at one another talking chit chatting flirting in yani this is free mixing people don't do this in the haram nor in on airplanes or buses or in a mall they just walk they don't know each other now for you to go to a restaurant with your uncles and aunts they're mara but with your cousins female cousins and you sit on the same table and she's sitting in front of you she's not wearing the hijab and probably she's putting some makeup and everybody's talking freely and mixing and laughing and chit chatting and engaging in conversations this is free mixing this is where shaytan is setting his traps and waiting for the right moment he has already thrown his bait and waiting for the right moment and this is what islam prohibits and this is part of blocking the means so some things are haram for their own sake and something are haram because they are means that would take you somewhere so if i were to shake hands with an an mahram woman would that be an actual sin in itself that would take me to hell because of itself or because of what it will inevitably and eventually lead to so in order to block the means of fornication and adultery this doesn't happen overnight there are steps of shaytan that we have to follow and one of them is looking one of them is chit-chatting one of them is touching one of them is seclusion and then you take it to third base this is what's haram in islam so the means that lead to haram they also become haram and islam tells you to cut and block the means so i hope this answers your question mustafa you"
