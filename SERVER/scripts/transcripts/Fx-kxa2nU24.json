  "title": "Those who are offended when they are told if something is Kufr or not !",
  "transcript": "If you doubt that someone can produce a verse or a chapter similar to the Qur'an in its majestic and miraculous form, you're not a Muslim. It's a no-brainer. And the funny thing is, people are offended when people come, whether they're reverts or non-reverts, and they air their doubts and whispers. And you ask them, Akhi, do you doubt the Qur'an or the authenticity of the hadith, or you know that this is from Allah and from the Prophet, you still have doubt in it, you're challenging it, you don't accept it, this is kufr. They're offended by it. The hell with them. So be careful Akhi, why are you bringing these topics? Either you believe, then you should say, you should say, or you don't believe, then you should have a counselling session one-to-one, not on public TV, where you tell everybody that, hmm, I don't know, because this is unfortunately kufr."
