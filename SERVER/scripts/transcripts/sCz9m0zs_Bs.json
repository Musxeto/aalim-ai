  "transcript": "abdul aziz from sri lanka yes uh my question is uh what uh when when when we have committed questioning and uh after some time we we really felt famous and we have repented sincerely like we repented himself and while we are repenting uh we automatically feed the last punishment and shed tears and we was consistent in that and afterwards even though shaytan is sheikhan always tempts us to make that scene seem interesting so we requested we repented but after some time again shaytan comes to us with whispering about the about the enjoyment of the sin but we still still say audible and we still continue to repent and we are somehow uh for some reason i'm hating that same so in this case uh at a point uh within our own hearts we feel like allah has accepted our repentance already so does this mean a clear sign that allah is really accepting accepted our repentance and what about the sins that we have forgotten and how do we repent for the sins we have committed and we've forgotten okay you're entitled only for one question abdul aziz and uh you've asked two questions so question number one this feeling you're getting is it a sign of acceptance from allah azzawajal it can be but it can also be a trick from satan to make you satisfied and stop feeling remorseful and to be happy that allah has accepted your repentance so we cannot confirm nor deny and the safest approach for us is to consider that this is in allah's hands we always live in fear that allah may not have accepted our repentance which this fear is positive because it pushes us forward to do more good deeds and to refrain from doing any more sins and and do this until the day we die if we manage to do this it's a win-win because we've died progressing and doing good things refraining from haram and we will insha allah be certain after our death that allah has accepted our repentance you"
