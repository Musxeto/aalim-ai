  "title": "Ep. 17 | Birr Inclination or Gut Feeling | Prophetic Hadith to Bring Relief to the Heart",
  "transcript": "[Music] can [Music] dear brothers and sisters in [Music] Islam Al may Allah be pleased with him said I once asked asked the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam and said oh prophet of Allah tell me of what is lawful for me and what is unlawful and this is part of being direct no sugar coating no long speeches give me something give me straightforward answer what is lawful what is unlawful now the prophet could have listed all the unlawful things and that would have taken a lot of time but the prophet sallallahu alaih wasam being a man of wisdom abua says he looked at me attentively and then said righteousness in Arabic the word is Al righteousness is that which brings peace to the soul and Tranquility to the heart where sin is that which unsettles the soul and causes unease in the heart even if those who issue verdicts Scholars and people of knowledge even if they give you rulings otherwise this beautiful Hadith needs to be pondered upon first of all Al in the Quran and in the Sunnah this beautiful minute word Al has many meanings one of them is to be kind to others as in theith righteousness or is defined by good moral conduct when you see someone with a big beard and short th praying in the First Mid doing all the sunnas he can musak and the whole nine yards but he's rude he lies he's stingy he breaks promises this person is not righteous because you can tell from his moral conduct so alir is to be kind to others specifically to be kind to the parents and this is why it's called to be dutiful respectful and obedient and it is mainly mentioned with all humans all others that's righteousness I Omar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father used to say he used to say righteousness is an easy thing a cheerful face and soft and kind words this is what righteousness is the second meaning of encompasses all good deeds whether apparent or concealed Allah says in righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the east or the west but true righteousness is in one of who believes in Allah the last day the Angels the book and the prophets and gives wealth in spite of love for it to relatives orphans the needy and a whole list of good deeds so righteousness or B here encompasses all good Deeds that Allah loves such as the belief in Allah the Angels the books The Messengers the forms of worship that we can see such as expenditures and and sodak in the way in the means of uh uh that Allah loves establishing Salat and fulfilling your promises and being patient over what calamities May strike may may strike you the third me meaning of Al or righteousness is what your heart is inclined to and you feel that this is the right thing to do in other terms your gut feeling this means that Allah has created us to know what is right and what is wrong and he made it in our DNA that we feel inclined to doing good things and Fe to be repelled from bad things and in these lines we can understand what abdah may Allah be pleased with him said he says whatever the Muslims see to be good then with Allah it's good and whatever the Muslims see to be bad then at the sight of Allah it is bad now this Hadith is not a cart blanch is not an open invitation for anyone of us to follow their guts because this is specifically to those who have a pure natural inclination pure F that is not tarnished and not changed sometimes our gut feeling May contradict Shar what to do Satan could come and say when Allah ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam I had a gut feeling I shouldn't do this who are you crazy Allah is giving you a clear directive and you're not following it this is insane so your gut feeling is not always something to follow spec especially if it goes against the Shar sometimes the prophet Alam would order his companions to do something and they would not do it and he would be angered by that in Hajj for example when he told them to reduce their Hajj which they intended into they thought that how could we do this how could we shave before the day ofid when he told them to slaughter their sacrifice when they were blocked in and they were prevented from completing it they had to go back to Medina how could they go in the state of and come a year later and remain in state of Haram so this was a he told them to slaughter their sacrifice and shave their heads and wear their normal clothes they did not like that when the prophet had a treaty with the Idol worshippers they didn't like that so should have should they have followed their gut feeling the answer is no so this Hadith does not apply to issues when there is a clear evidence backing it up this Hadith applies to when an issue of debate and there is no clear directive from the Quran or the Sunnah and it's just an opinion of a scholar where you are inclined due to feeling that it is not right and there is nothing crystal clear and you have a clear conscience and a natural inclination towards what's right and what's wrong basically whever there is a clearcut evidence or proof from the Quran and the Sunnah we as Muslims have no right to think otherwise I talk to many many people Servants of this duny not of Allah and they simply don't accept the rulings of the Quran and the Sunnah the rulings of segregation between the genders they're fixated on free mixing on partying and they say no I don't believe in this my gut feeling says it's okay they these are followers of shatan Allah says in the Quran but no by your lord so Allah is swearing by himself but no by your Lord they will not truly believe until they make you oh Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then and then find within themselves no discomfort they agree they approve they find no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in full willing submission so this is what every single Muslim must abide by but when there is no clear directive no proof or evidence from Quran or from Sunnah there is nothing from the Coates of the companions of the Sala of the umah there's nothing and then there is only this fatwa from someone that we don't trust his knowledge his religious commitment yeah he's a celebrity he's a Muti on online or on social media but he's not known to be a real heavyweight scholar rather he's known to follow his whims and desires every couple of months or years he flips the fatwa and says oh it was Haram now it's Halal in this case because there is no Clear Proof the believer goes back to what itches his heart so if he feels that no no I I I don't believe this is right then you stick with your gut feeling I'll give you a couple of examples if you go to the West you'll find these so-called Scholars saying to you that you can buy a house in Mortgage in RBA if it's your first house now the evidences from the Quran and Sunnah State otherwise but assumingly that there is no clear-cut evidence which there are plenty assuming here because you feel that it's not right you're got feeling tells the vast majority of Muslims that no this is not right so then you have to stay away even if these muftis paid mutis have said to you it's ofk I'll give you a second example and this is something that I give fat in in the west I say that it is permissible to eat the meat which is served by the Christians in America or in Europe because it's a Christian country because we don't have proof that it was not slaughtered so the default according to verse 5 chapter 5 in the Quran and to the numerous hadiths of the Prophet is to say bah and to eat and this is the fat of baz and the great Scholars of Islam now this is an issue of dispute among Scholars but this is what I am inclined to and I follow if you live in the west and you say oh my heart is itching I don't feel good about this my gut feeling tells me I shouldn't 100,000% don't eat she you just said it's okay yes I said it's okay but nobody's hitting you on your hand to go and eat if you feel that this is is not right you should refrain nobody would say why did you refrain you're sinful but the opposite might be right if you eat it while not feeling good Scholars would say now you're doing something wrong and it's not permissible so as the prophet saidat burden sinful thing is what itches inside of you and you're not comfortable with it and this is related like says to the people of righteousness and piety as for the Sinners the open Sinners the people of uh uh uh heinous things it doesn't apply to them because they're inclined to Haram so no matter what you bring them from Quran or Sunnah or the uh coach of Scholars they would say nah my gut feeling says it's okay and they do it without even blinking so this is what the Hadith is referring tolam may Allah have mercy on his soul says in the authentic Hadith the Hadith Allah says my servant continues to offer voluntary Deeds to me until I love him if I love him then I become his hearing that he hears with and his sight that he sees with to the end of the Hadith this Hadith means that Allah would support an individual whom he loves and he will only make him see what is good and hear what is good he would have a clear gut feeling and this is the natural inclination to the majority of people whose natural inclin inclination their F has not changed when your heart is filled with righteousness you can see things other can't unlike a haunted heart a dark and hard heart may Allah be pleased with him man with his father says a Believer has a glowing light in his heart and in the authentic Hadith the prophet told usam when the Antichrist when the Dalal comes out every believer whether literate or illiterate would read on his forehead disbeliever others can't see this they can't see the writing on the wall and in this case on his forehead but believers who have this light in their heart are able to see it because they have this natural pure natural inclination which means that a Believer would see what others won't be able to see especially at times of FNA and tribulations and Calamity so whenever the heart is filled with righteousness this is a gift from Allah because Allah Asel gave that individual someone to remind him in his heart where he could distinguish between good and bad what is pleasing Allah and what is evil and I pray to Allah subhah wa ta'ala that he gives us such pure hearts that can see what pleases Allah to do it and see what angers Allah to stay away from it we have a short break stay tuned and insh we'll be right back"
