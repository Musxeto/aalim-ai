  "title": "While Fasting, If a Person Lies, Backbites, Listens to Music, Would his Fast be Accepted?",
  "transcript": "[Music] if while fasting a person lies back bites listens to music would his fast that is abstaining from food and water be accepted well to answer your question the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam did this job for us when he said whoever does not abandon falsehood this is a loser and acting upon it and ignorant Allah does not need him to refrain from eating and drinking what does this hadith mean it means that the essence of fasting is not merely refraining from drinking and eating and having intimacy with the spouse yes this is the main thing in it in what appears to you and I but the essence of fasting was mentioned in the ayah of surah al-baqarah it was prescribed upon you and those who were before you o you who believe fasting has been prescribed upon you and upon those before you so you may reach the level of taqwa so you may fear allah azza wajal so this is the essence of fasting what good is fasting when you lie slander backbite sin openly even when someone abuses you the Prophet says alayhi salat wa sallam when it is the day of fasting of one of you and someone swears at you someone curses you or someone abuses you do not reply to him rather say I am fasting so in Islam we know that when you are abused it is your god-given right to abuse back if someone swears that you Allah gives you the permission to swear back at him if he say if he says that you are stupid it's okay to say it's you who is stupid if he says you are a dog though this is not an insult nowadays in Arabic it is when you say to someone you're a dog he would probably fight you or fight with you but in America the this is a compliment a you're my dog not all the villa tomorrow maybe they say you might you're my Pig you never know nevertheless you can say the same to them in retaliation and it's one in return of one but if he goes beyond that if he slanders your mother and accuses her of prostitution you have no right in accusing his mother now the scene is in on him this is major if he does something bad to your brother you can't do something similar to his brother because it's not his brother's fault and so on so even in such a scenario when someone abuses you while you are in the state of fasting allah azzawajal tells us to the frame and to say i'm fasting scholars interpret this they say either you verbally say it to him by saying i'm fasting which means that listen I could have retaliated but because I'm fasting my fasting prevents me from doing this or saying I am fasting is not verbal but rather expressed in your action when you simply refrain from retaliating so coming back to the question the person is fasting technically but what would his reward be at the sight of Allah it would definitely be something negligible because the essence of fasting was not there he refrained from eating and drinking and so many people on diet refrain from eating and drinking so what's the difference there there was not the element of worshiping allah azzawajal to get closer to him and again this is the biggest problem in how we practice Islam we practice it because it's a cultural thing we practice it because our parents say that it is taboo if you don't pray in the message with us our parents say it is wrong and what would the people say if we do not cover ourselves up properly if women don't wear the hijab probably so we're doing it out of a cultural thing something that the customs dictate upon us to do and this is wrong and this is a big problem because this the consequence of it would appear on our dying bed when people around us tell us say la ilaha illa llah we try to say it and we fail why because we did not practice Islam out of our conviction and belief but rather out of tradition out of customs and if it were not for those around me I would have done so many hideous things but people are watching and this is why when we travel abroad and no one knows us we do hideous things may Allah so shall protect us [Music] [Applause] you"
