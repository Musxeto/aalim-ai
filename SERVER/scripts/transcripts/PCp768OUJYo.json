  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Saudi my question is how can I \nfind the khusu' in Salah means I pray Salah but   I am unable to concentrate in salah okay first of \nall I think on my YouTube channel there are five   or six video clips that may assist you in that \nso I highly recommend that you go and check them   But to answer your question \nkhusu' or submissiveness   or the ability to concentrate in your prayer \nis not something that you can adopt immediately   it's not a pill you can take or an injection that \nwould secure this state to you rather it is a full   life transformation see what brings khusu' \nto Salat one knowledge knowledge of what   knowledge of whom you are praying to so \nif your heart is filled with knowledge   of Allah of his might of his greatness of his \nMercy if you know the beautiful names of Allah   and his attributes when you say Allahu Akbar \nyour heart is filled with the love of Allah   when you have the knowledge of the meaning of what \nyou're reciting when a a slave or a servant says Allah replies to that and says my servant \nhas praised me my servant has complimented me   Etc so when you know that there is a Hadith that \ntalks about the Fatiha as a form of dialogue when   you recite it you don't just simply ameen \nwhat did you do you'll have to have khusu'   in that when all what you think about is your \nwork in the kitchen the groceries when you're   going to get the children from school your \nwedding that you're attending at the end of   the week the festivals here and there and \nyour in-laws and your relatives you finish and you have not benefit from Salat so it's not \nsomething I can give it to you in a few minutes   or seconds I myself am struggling with it I've \nbeen struggling with it all my life we will reach   a time when we will have no struggles and we will \nenjoy it when we reach this time we will attain   Allah's forgiveness the prophet says whoever makes \na perfect wudu and praise to rakas two does not   whisper in them or speak to himself \nfull concentration and submissiveness   he will be forgiven all of his previous \nsins if you manage to do these two rakas   you've got it made it can't happen overnight \nit requires a lot and a lot of hard work but   then the sweetness of the results would make you \nforget everything hard that you had to encounter"
