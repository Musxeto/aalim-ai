  "transcript": "and this is what caused scholars to say that it is not permissible for a person to donate his body organs after death which is a craze a lot of the people are falling into so a person writes in his will after i die you can take my um a cornea or eye or whatever you can take my liver you can take my kidneys you can take my heart you can take whatever you want of body parts as if it is a junkyard uh full of cars and you just stripping it of spare parts this is not permissible this is not your body you have been entrusted with this body after you die it must not be humiliated or treated in a way that is disrespectful to it this is not your body to play with or to um donate to anyone and hence you are not allowed to do this what about um body organs donation while alive if the organ reproduces and there's no harm on your life this is permissible as i was told that donating part of your liver is permissible because it grows back again but to give an eye which you cannot replace nor it cannot grow back again this is permiss this is prohibited to donate your blood is permissible because this regenerates if you have two or three kidneys and you donate one and there's no risk on your life inshallah this is permissible providing that there is a cause and a reason for that and it's not financial because selling any of these things is totally prohibited in islam"
