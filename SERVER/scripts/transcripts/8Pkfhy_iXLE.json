  "transcript": "Saad from India. Assalamu Alaikum. Salamu Alaikum. I cannot hear you. Saad, Saad, Saad. You have to speak clearly to the microphone in order for me to understand your question. I can't answer your question if you're not audibly understood. Can you hear me now? Loud and clear. Sheikh, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you loud and clear. I have urine incontinence for some hours. I don't know if it's right or wrong, but I pray every prayer at the last time of it. Can I pray like one hour or two hours before the end time if I know that urine incontinence will last more, like three or four hours more? You asked me this question on my website, correct? Yes, Sheikh. And I sent you the answer, but I will repeat it just for those who do not see the answer on the email, of course. So, if a person has or suffers from urine incontinence, and he usually delays it till the end of time by four to five minutes, as you mentioned in the email, and he prays it then, the prayer is valid. However, if there is a time where the urine stops, then he can pray at that time. If you, as you've stated that you know that all the time the urine is continuous, and you suffer from urine incontinence, and it will not stop, in this case, no need to delay it till the end of time. Rather, because of your condition as a ma'zoor, the moment the adhan of, let's say, Asr prayer is called, you can go to the toilet, clean yourself, change your soiled clothes, make wudu, even if urine still continues to come out, no problem, go out and pray with the congregation in the masjid. Because you're allowed to pray from that time, you perform wudu, till the sunset. Once the sun sets, meaning the Asr time is up, then you have to do the process again of cleaning yourself, changing your clothes, performing wudu, and then you can pray till the end of time of that prayer. And I hope this answers your question. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me, and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah. Ameen."
