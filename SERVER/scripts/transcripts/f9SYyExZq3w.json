  "transcript": "Najwa from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Is having burnt food whether a little bit or a lot haram? As I've heard that it causes some illnesses but I'm not sure if that's true. I don't know about this because you have to ask a medical doctor however who in his right mind would eat burnt food other than a poor husband who is afraid of his wife's backlash and nagging him. So something that is defected and burnt and not fit for human consumption in general cases nobody would eat that and would throw it in the dustbin. Now whether it causes harm or not this is something you have to relate to medical doctors if they say that such burnt food would cause cancer and it's harmful then it becomes haram."
