  "transcript": "Sir Farz from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I am a software engineer here in UAE So my company comes up with a project that is basically an e-commerce store But the most important thing is that they are going to introduce online buying and selling of gold, gold bars, gold and jewelry So what do you say? Is it permissible to work on such projects and develop such projects for them? In Islam, it is prohibited to buy and sell gold, silver, salt, barley, wheat and dates Unless it is done hand to hand And it is identical in weight and in value This is when it comes to gold with gold, silver with silver Or gold with silver, it has to be hand to hand So if a person wants to buy gold with money It has to be simultaneous, give and take at the same, physically at the same place Buying it online is totally prohibited And unfortunately, people nowadays are only interested in a quick gain and profit Halal, haram, nobody cares Now there are famous apps coming and say we have our app on NASDAQ or whatever Dow Jones and the things And we deal in transactions and in gold and in silver You just know what you have to do is just click on the app and transfer the money and we do everything for you And they claim that they are Muslims or Sharia compliant And when you go and check them, there is no scholars to back them up Except some of the influencers and some of those famous people on the TikTok or Instagram and the likes And they say they're good, they're good How do you know? Do you deal with them? Have you dealt with them? And this is not permissible to give your name and to endorse people without looking into their transactions One of their famous apps approached me and the owner spoke with me And he asked me to be on board their Sharia board And I said okay, I have no problem Who hates money? As long as you're paying, I'm willing But I'm not willing at all to endorse my name until I look into your transactions and see the actual investments And be certain that I'm putting my name where I trust and people that trust me can follow I never got a call from him back again Therefore, be careful Now, you work in the IT services You will be programming and facilitating and making these apps And helping them in their business, which we know now that it is not permissible So the answer is you have to look for another field and must not collaborate with them on it And Allah knows best"
