  "title": "Sin to call the Prophet “Muhammad” ‎ﷺ ? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Allah Azza Wa Jal called our Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam in the Quran, but he never called him by name. He never said, O Muhammad. He would always call him, O Prophet of Allah or, and this was mentioned 13 times in the Quran, or would say, O Messenger of Allah. And this was mentioned twice in the Quran. But you will never ever find Allah addressing him with, O Muhammad. While if you recite the Quran, you will find Allah addressing Moses, Noah, Jesus, all the Messenger of Allah with their names, Ya Musa, Ya Isa. And he would not say to them, Ya O Prophet or O Messenger. And Allah Azza Wa Jal forbade us from calling the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam Muhammad. So you should not say, and Muhammad came, and Muhammad went, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. You always have to say, and the Prophet of Allah, Muhammad, or the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad. So never fall into the mistake of calling him by name alone. This is a sin. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
