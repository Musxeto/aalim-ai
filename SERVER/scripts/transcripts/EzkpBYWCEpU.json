  "transcript": "So, our first caller is Yunus from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, my uncle and aunt were married 25 years back, Sheikh, without presence and will of Wali. And they have three children, Sheikh, now. And I came to know and believe that marriage without Wali is invalid. So, is it farz upon me to convey this ruling and say to renew the marriage? Or should I remain silent? Will I be sinful if I don't convey this ruling to them? Jazakumullahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum. First of all, we have discussed this issue before and stated that the most authentic opinion is that the marriage of a woman without the approval and consent of her guardian or of her Wali is invalid according to the authentic Hadith. And this is the opinion of Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. May Allah have mercy on them. Imam Abu Hanifa went against this verdict and against the advice of his two disciples who said that we have to follow the Hadith. May Allah have mercy on him. However, due to the fact that the vast majority of the people who follow the Hanafi Madhhab are laymen and this is the best of their knowledge, and they married according to the school of thought that they follow. Due to the fact that this is a reputable school of thought, we say that we cannot just simply go and cross out the marriages of 300 or 400 million Muslims. But we say that those who got married following that opinion and believing in it, their marriage is valid. Secondly, for you, the Prophet ï·º said, it is part or it is a sign of a person's good Islam to leave what is none of his business. Your uncle and aunt are not your business. What they have done 25 years ago, probably even before you were born, is something for them to take care of. You're not a Mufti. They did not come to you to ask you for your opinion. The issue you are disliking is not something that is agreed upon among scholars. It is best for you to stay away from this and to leave what is none of your business. And Allah knows best."
