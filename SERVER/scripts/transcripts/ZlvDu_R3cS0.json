  "transcript": "Abrar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh after the Fajr congregation when the Imam makes dua I get up and go to the masjid's balcony to sacrifice myself from them and engage in Azkat and recitation of the holy Quran but my father aside not here my father is illiterate he doesn't know how to read or write who is part of the yes Wallahi Abrar your line is breaking due to your internet connection but I will try to improvise so if you leave the congregation that is involved in innovation by doing congregational dua after the salat and you move to somewhere else you're doing the right thing inshallah and you're not sinful for that if your father is sitting with them then you have no authority over your father and you're not accountable for his mistakes now maybe your question would have been that my father insists that I sit with him and if he insists and this is a masjid and you fear that he would be angry or lost or I don't know in this case no problem in sitting but not joining them in the dua just do your Azkar and Allah knows best"
