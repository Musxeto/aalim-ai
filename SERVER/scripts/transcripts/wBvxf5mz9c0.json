  "title": "First Time Dr Zakir Naik Knew that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is Mentioned in Hindu Scripture",
  "transcript": "my name is Muhammad Usman Khan and I'm from Kashmir working in Delhi NCR India I want to ask Dr Zakir Nik that when did you first come to know that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is mentioned in Hindu scriptures and what was your reaction I was really shocked when I first came to know about it as a working with Hindus I want to give dawa to them can you give me a few tips on how I should initiate this conversation with them I'm enrolled in the a training program and I request you please expedite the upload speed I have memorized a few of your references from Hindu scriptures but how can I get basic knowledge so that it should not give an impression that I have not read these scriptures and I have just memorized few passages I become a full-time D can you give me a few contacts in Delhi or any part in India who can help me in the same Muhammad us Khan who working in Delhi as the question that maybe you heard my talk on Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam in the Hindu scriptures and he asked me when did I first come to know that Prophet Muhammad was mentioned in Hindu scriptures because when he came to me he was shocked as you know that I was inspired by Sheik Ahmed Dad when I met him in 1997 and after a few years after that I read this book by the title Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam in the world religious scriptures and another book Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam in Hindu scriptures written by vidari written by Hindu and this was in the early '90s maybe early '90s exactly I don't remember early '90s or mid90s and even I was shocked no one had told me before that uh Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was mentioned in the scriptures and if you of course I knew about Prophet Muhammad mentioned the Bible I knew many prophecies and when I compared between the prophecies mentioned of mhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam in the Bible and the Prophecies of the Hindu scriptures the Prophecies of the Hindu scriptures were multiple times more more and Muhammad Sall mentioned by name multiple times more multiple times more in the Hindu scriptures than the Bible Bible okay you can memorize all the verses and and the references but in Hindu scriptures there are too many hundreds in the Bible there are less than that so and I started using that in the question after session the first time I give a talk on this topic similarities between Islam and Hinduism I give this talk I I remember it was in 2004 in aad maidan in Bombay I remember aad midan that's a big it's a big ground and that time time it was one of the few largest lectures at that time you know 18,000 people had come I know we had put we had kept 18,000 chairs and about 20,000 people attended the talk and that was the first talk which was on a on a grand scale at that time in 2004 and after that I even gave a talk on Muhammad sallallah Al wasallam in the religious for scriptures and Muhammad sahi the Hindu scriptures I gave in Chennai and the other parts so all these three talks for closed in 2004 5 67 yes it did shock me and when I prepared for my talk on similar Islam and Hinduism I did a lot of research because inanity it was easy Shad made it so easy you read his books you can even debate with the Pope he gave it to you on a platter but there were very few books that were written on Hinduism and Islam and I think this was the only book I could find Prophet Muhammad new scripture then I did my own research and I did some own study and read the scripture then I prepared this talk on similarities between Islam and Christianity Tred to divide it in my own way comparing with the pillars of Islam with the pillars of Iman and you know various things while answering many question answer sessions you know regarding what about Jihad mention the Quran Jad mention in the Hindu scriptures and all this what I've been saying for the last few years I compiled and cre and made and give a new talk similari between Islam and Hinduism regarding your last question that you have you have enrolled in the da training program what the B is referring to is our new platform alh where we have a training course called as let's become effective dies International da training program and we have launched this platform in 2021 about three years ago and one of the courses is which is the USP unique selling course is let's become effective dies this is the recording of the training program we did in mombay where we call 20 different D or students from 12 different countries we call them in Bombay it was for 45 days 33 days of training was there and we recorded this on 14 cameras and now we are editing and releasing it we have a program of editing one one part per month because unlike before where we had a big team of 300 people working in the media now our team is smaller and these programs have got 14 cameras they are 4K and 8K very voluminous very heavy so it takes multiple times more so each course is for about one and half two hours of recording so the recording time for these courses take double than that than a normal lecture and compared to our doctors Z about four to five times more so we have a policy of releasing one one part per month and even that sometimes we aren't able to do it sometime it becomes one part in two months but of course it will take years to release so you can follow this course see this course follow the course guide but as far as your knowledge on Hinduism is concerned I would request you to see few of my cassets number one is similarity between Islam and Hinduism number two Muhammad sallahu Ali wasallam in the Hindu scriptures and then there are other question answer sessions so if you hear these talks of mine and these question so if you go through ask Dr Zakir and see all the question on Hinduism or see all my questions and public lectures we deal with Hinduism this in give you knowledge regarding a question that how can I I memorize these verses but how can I give the impression that I know a lot you should not give false impression as a d you should not give false impression if you really want to know read the scriptures I would advise you to read the scriptures if you read bhag GA it's not very voluminous read it so the references I've given okay read the the references memorize those references and read the book bhagwad Gita or some of the books you know so at least you have a idea what you can do if you cannot read the full RAM and read the shorter version there are many versions available short medium long very long very voluminous so if you want or you see my video cassettes and you just repeat it if someone tells you where you found it from from I heard it from Dr Zak is it authentic you check it up it's been checked so you don't have to give a false impression that you're are Dr Zak you don't have to the false impression that you have read thousands of books on Hinduism no you have to be honest but some books are which are popular and not very time consuming the bhagat Gita it will just take a few hours little bit more for you to read the full bhagat Gita even that has got different volumes Etc but natur the important books are the vas view my talks you'll find out so you don't have to give a false impression regarding do you have any contacts in Delhi or India you don't require contacts everything is available now on the social media you don't have to go to that City to learn to meet me you don't have to come here you can meet me on the social media on the satellite on the television to gain knowledge now it's easy everything the whole world has become a global village you can Google you can see the videos you can see peace TV you can see the speakers of Peace TV and if you go on the social media if you're on Al it's better Al you can select it is a social media which is a paid social media unlike YouTube or or Facebook we can only upload videos but the way you can see on as far superior we have made it absolutely free and one more good thing I like to mention that in the last couple of months we have launched the otd platform that's over the top where we are available on very different platforms not only on the free social media we are available on the mobile whether it's already there for many years whether it be iOS or whether it be Android whether on the web whether it be Safari Chrome now we have gone on various televisions we available in Samsung on LG on Sony on hen on fire on roko so in the last few months we have gone on OT platforms all the top and this is the streaming which doesn't require satellite right we are there on the satellite for many years mallah since 2006 so now it's about more than 18 years that we on the satellite we are there on the social media the free social media we went on the paid social media that is Al there now recently past few years we have W OT that's over the top streaming you can see on your television you don't require the the satellite you can come through the internet you know and in this way the reach will increase so surely you can get a lot of knowledge you don't have to have a satellite besides the PE TV besides the free social media besides the paid social media the OT is also a very good platform hope that answers the question"
