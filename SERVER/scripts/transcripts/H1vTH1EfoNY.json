  "title": "Consensus on rebelling against a Muslim ruler (clarification) assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "i mean from the uk there are people saying that in your video you said that there's no id in rebellion against the ruler they also said that you said it's a waste of time to re to refute people and he said and you promoted a techfiti so can you just give a classification okay from the uk he says you have stated that there is no consensus on the prohibition of rebellion on over the muslim imam this question has been frequently asked and people keep on bombarding uh my email account my website with it saying that you said this and so said this first of all we are all not infallible we're humans we make mistakes even the great sheikhs make mistakes and those who they quote saying there is consensus it is wrong it is not true if you do your research you will find great great scholars of islam stating what had happened is it sinful or not of course it is sinful when it's uncalled for but there are a number of cases done by tabirin done by sahabah themselves which proves that there is no consensus per se but these late scholars nowadays they brush it off and say there is consensus imam ahmed said may allah have mercy on his soul whoever claims the consensus of muslims is a liar how does he know that a muslim scholar in this country or that did not differ with him when you say consensus you have to have proof so you have to come to a level of the companions or the tabern or tablet table or an era of muslim unity when all scholars at that particular time they all agreed and they had the consensus otherwise you cannot just simply say it for political reasons or for this reason or that therefore yes there is no consensus is it right definitely not you must abide by obeying the muslim ruler even if he was corrupt even if he was a thief even if he was a tyrant as long as he's a muslim as long as he establishes salat this is the instruction and orders of the prophet is islam you and i cannot go against it so we have to abide and obey but this doesn't mean that we have to cross the line and claim consensus over something that there is no consensus over it and allah's vision knows best"
