  "title": "Permanent Hair Straightening | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Rema says is permanent hair tinning permissible because some people say this comes under the prohibition of changing the creation of allah azza wajal when you want to straighten your hair even if it is permanent as long as it is medically safe there is no problem in that so if I use oil for example to straighten up my beard the effect may be wears off in a few hours a couple of days so if I apply this again and again and again until I die this is like doing it permanently there's no problem in doing that because fixing the hair calming the hair this is something that Islam recommends so if you can straighten it up without harming your health and body then there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
