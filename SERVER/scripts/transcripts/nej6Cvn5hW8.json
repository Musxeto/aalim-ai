  "transcript": "allah from pakistan he says i came and joined the congregation in the third rakah so the imam prayed the third and the fourth in the final to shahood he concluded the prayer like a uh uh very fast so i was in the middle of the tasha i finished my tasha as i was going to the salutation upon the prophet salallahu what to do nothing the moment he says allah to the left you stand up to the third rakah no problem why because you actually were in your second rakah though the imam was in his fourth you were in his second so what's mandatory upon you is to say which is it and you did that no need to add afterwards the salutation upon the prophet and you can conclude your prayer"
