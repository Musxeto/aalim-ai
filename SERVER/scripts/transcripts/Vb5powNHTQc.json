  "transcript": "The final question is from Amber. She says, √¨How does a woman cover her face in Ihram? Is a separate scarf okay to use and can it touch the face?√Æ First of all, again, the Prophet Ô∑∫ did not specify how a woman should cover her face. Rather, he prohibited a woman in the state of Ihram, when she√≠s performing Umrah or Hajj, to wear the Niqab. And the Niqab is a face covering that has holes in it. So this is a Niqab. And this is prohibited in the state of Ihram for women. They can throw something on their faces, a layer, two, three, depending on the transparency of that and how they are able to see. Because we don√≠t want them to put a blindfold, that wouldn√≠t be logical. So maybe one layer at night and two layers in the daytime would conceal her face, but at the same time would not hinder her from seeing the road and seeing what√≠s in front of her. This is permissible. Whether it touches your face or not, it has no relevance. So what some schools of thought mandate upon women to wear a structure or a hat that has a structure in front of it so that they can throw the face cover on top of it and it would be like a car bumper. It wouldn√≠t allow the face cover to touch their face, saying that this is Haram. This is totally baseless. This has no foundation in Islam, none whatsoever. And it√≠s prohibited to wear because this is an innovation. So like Mother Aisha, Mother Asma, her sister, said in the Hadith, we performed Hajj with the Prophet Ô∑∫ and we used to uncover our faces. And the moment riders passed by us, we used to throw something and cover our faces with. That√≠s it. No niqab and nothing of that sort. And Allah knows best."
