  "transcript": "finally the final question is from Fatima she says is it allowed for girls to call each other bro recently this slang has been introduced and it's very common for girls to be addressing one another like this so is that okay the answer is no this is not okay the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam cursed women who imitate men and Cursed Men Who imitate women so a man wearing a wig and a dress so a drag queen or whatever he's cursed by Allah and likewise a woman who acts like a tomboy she's cursed by Allah women or girls among themselves they can't call one another bro because bro though it's a slang word it's an abbreviation of brother and gender wise she cannot call a woman a brother should call oh sis no problem in that but to choose bro this would be imitating the men and this is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment"
