  "transcript": "The next question is, as per the Sunnah, I have left my beard as it is and it is now three fish lengths. But my whole family keeps on telling me to trim it as it is rough and doesn't look good. What should I do? Don't look at what people say. Even if you keep it one millimeter long, you will find people saying, Akhi, shave it. Every time I kiss you on the cheek, it perks me. Nobody is going to be happy. As long as you follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah, you're fine. A three fist, mashallah, this is quite long. As long as it is not hampering your life, it's not threatening to your life, keep it. It's a form of pride. This is the Sunnah of the Prophet, Alayhis salatu Wassalam, who had a big beard. And this is not an exaggeration. The Tabi'een asked the companions, may Allah be pleased with them. When the Prophet prayed the Zuhr and Asr, did he recite the Qur'an? They said, yes. The Tabi'een said, how did you know? How do you know that he used to recite the Qur'an? They said, we used to see the trembling of his beard from behind his back. We're standing at the back, but we can see his beard. How can you see his beard if it's not really wide and big? In the description, it used to fill his chest, Alayhis salatu Wassalam, his beard. So this is the way of the Prophet, Alayhis salatu Wassalam. Yes, sometimes people who have long beards that are maybe reaching their belly button and they work at machines and factories. This is hazardous, dangerous. Or sometimes it is a means of becoming nuisance. Every time you eat, you find hair of your beard in your mouth. It happens. It's not something to make fun of. No, this is what happens. Sometimes if you're driving a scooter or a car and it comes in your face, it becomes... No, I'm not, again, making fun. This is one of the beautiful sunnahs of the Prophet, Alayhis salatu Wassalam. If it is endangering your livelihood, yes, I feel that you can shorten it to the appropriate length that would not harm you. Now, the opinion of a fist length is adopted by Umar, may Allah be pleased with him. When he used to make hajj, interpreting the ayah at the end of Surah Al-Fatih, مُحَلِّقِينَ رُؤُسَكُمْ وَمُقَصِّرِينَ The ayah is referring to how to end your ihram by either shaving your head or clipping your head. No, he understood it as shaving your head and clipping your beard. So only in hajj he used to do this. So even if we follow this, which is not the most authentic opinion, it's a fist length. Now, most people do this. It's a fist length from the bottom, not from the top. So they do it the other way around. And this is not right. This is not right. So leave, yahi. And so many people are so nosy and they poke their noses in where it should not be. Yahi, your beard is too long. Yahi, why don't you shorten it? Yahi, it's none of your business. Why are you asking me these questions or interfering in my life? This is my beard. Why are you so tired of me wearing it? So, the Prophet said, alayhis salatu was salam, مِنْ حُسْنِ إِسْلَامِ الْمَرْءِ تَرْكُهُ مَا لَا يَعْنِيهُ It is a sign of a man's real good Islam that he leaves what is not of his business. Anything that's none of your business, don't ask about it. And Allah knows best."
