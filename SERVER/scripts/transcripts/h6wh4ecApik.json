  "transcript": "Saleh from Nigeria okay so my question is um now that social media has become a necessity what what became a necessity social social media okay yes so how can I ward off my own evil eye when watching videos that I like on those platforms why is it a a necessity who made it and necessity like when you want to learn even now that I'm watching you through YouTube and okay first of all social media is not a necessity at all a necessity is something that would make Haram things halal I'm stranded in a desert I'm starving I'm about to die necessity makes it permissible for me to eat this dead donkey one or two morsels so that I would not die of starvation this is a necessity so social media is not a necessity you mean to tell me that if I were to cancel all of my social media platforms that I would die no I would not that I would become ignorant of Islam no I would not alhamdulillah there are messages there are imams I can learn from there are students of knowledge I can go personally and physically to learn from there are books there are so many things where I can learn away from these social media secondly if you're talking only about YouTube there are platforms and apps that would block any other material than the one you're watching and this is highly recommended so that you don't go left or right but when we speak about Instagram or SnapChat or Tick Tock these are not platforms to learn Islam from and when you weigh the pros and cons we definitely say you have to block them and get rid of them likewise Facebook and the likes so just maintain your Islam and dignity and Chastity by blocking anything that would harm your Iman and lower it and Allah azzawajal Knows Best foreign"
