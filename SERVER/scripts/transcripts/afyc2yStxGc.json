  "transcript": "asiye says how to get closer to allah azza wajal now this kind of questions are so short but requires a lecture you want to get closer to Allah do what Allah commanded you to do and refrain and stay away from what Allah prohibited you to do in short Allah does not see you in a place where he does not want you to be and Allah does not miss you in a place where he ordered you to be in so if you follow the Sunnah if you practice the Deen if you surround yourself with Muslims all over 24/7 then you will be in good hands insha Allah"
