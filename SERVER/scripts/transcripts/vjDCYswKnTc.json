  "title": "How to react when our elders do HARAM? my Father wears GOLD!!! assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I will not look at you, huh? I know I'm scary. That's what my wife says, but yalla, maalish, huh? Hmm, ya Allah, jambu jambu, qaribu. Okay, if elders do haram, what is our responsibility? Number one, to be respectful. Number one, to be diplomatic. Number one, to also give them the ruling because we fear that it may take them to hell. Be respectful, diplomatic. So if you go and see your father wearing gold, this is your question, and you tell him, father, there is a hadith I read in Sahih al-Bukhari where the Prophet said, alayhis salatu wassalam, these are haram for my male men and halal for the women. And he held silk and gold. What does it mean, baba? And the father would explain to you and he knows, khalas, you did your job. You don't go and say, ah, but you're wearing gold and you will go to hell fire. What do you expect him to do? He will slap you. So you have to be wise. You have to be diplomatic. You have to be polite when you speak to the elders. And if you don't, then you have committed a more major sin. And Allah knows best."
