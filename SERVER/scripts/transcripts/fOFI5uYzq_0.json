  "title": "ðŸ†• Doubted Food Was Haram But Ate It Anyway, Can This Have An Impact On My Dua?",
  "transcript": "The third and final question, Junaid says, if someone eats something while having doubts that it might contain haram, but they aren't fully sure about it, but that food actually contained haram, in this case, since they had the food without being sure of it having haram ingredients, can this have an impact on their dua? See, the norm is that everything on earth is allegedly halal until proven otherwise. Consume and eat whatever is on earth, halal ta'eeb and pure halal for you. And by default, things that we consume, we can consume without checking and without cross-examining, because this is a default. Scholars make an exception when it comes to meat. They say you have to know whether it was halal meat or not. If according to the ghalabatul dhan, most likely, to the best of your knowledge, that it is halal, then you have to consume it without checking, as in the case if a Christian or a Jew invites me to a feast. Being a Christian or a Jew, as mentioned in the Quran, whatever they offer us of meat, whether cows, camels or sheep, this is halal for us to consume. So I don't have to check whether it was slaughtered or not, because he's a Jew or a Christian and their food that they present to us is halal. I have to just make sure it's not pork. So to the best of my knowledge, this is halal. I don't need to check. Likewise, if I go to the supermarket, I buy cakes, I buy bread, the default, it is halal until proven otherwise. I don't have to reverse this. It is haram until proven otherwise. No, it is halal until proven otherwise. I have no reason to check. Yes, somebody called me from Norway a couple of minutes ago and said that the bread we buy from the baker, I've asked the baker and they said yes, sometimes we do use pork in the ingredients. Okay, in this case, you asked. Khalas, you refrained from it. Or you have doubt, you should check. But generally speaking, buying cakes, buying things that are halal on display, a croissant or whatever, I don't have to check if my cappuccino has pork milk in it or not. The default is halal until proven otherwise and Allah knows best."
