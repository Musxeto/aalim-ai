  "title": "How do laymen handle differences of opinion niqab",
  "transcript": "from Canada on Twitter someone asked you about the ruling uh the photo of bani regarding uh not covering the face like covering the face not being obligatory and you replied that other shares like that it is obligatory so then you ask the rhetorical question uh whom should we follow the one with bigger biceps or we should refer to Quran Sunnah so the issue is uh we name and we don't know how to interpret the Quran and Sunnah that's why we look towards these big scholars in the first place so like when you say we have to go back to Quran Sunnah it seems like it's a never-ending cycle so like how do we when we when these colors differ in such rulings like what we do like we cannot like I said The Interpreter by ourselves okay first of all usually those who follow me on Twitter know what I mean and I'm often asked about this question and I always give the same answer people are divided into three types Scholars they don't need to ask anyone students of knowledge they don't have the knowledge of Scholars but they have sufficient knowledge to look into different views of Scholars and determine which is more authentic than the other by implementing the criteria of Quran and Sunnah with understanding of the favorite Generations number three are the laymen whom you are referring to who do not know how to implement the Quran and Sunnah as to filter the different views of Scholars who have different opinions so this is what I always reiterate and say over and over again so when I say that who has the bigger biceps four laymen they don't know and it's not by the size of the biceps that they can follow a particular scholar for a student of knowledge this is what I meant that the student of knowledge is the one qualified to look into what they mean said and scrutinize the evidences they had given and then counter that with what he said and scrutinize the evidence that he had given and come up with a conclusion because at the end of the day the truth at the site at the side of Allah and that the site of Allah is one so there are no two or three opinions that are all correct at the site of Allah it's only one that is valid and the rest are different ishti had they might be wrong they might be right that's why Allah says in chapter four Surah International and whenever there is a dispute among you refer it back to Allah and to his messenger meaning to the Quran and to the Sunnah so for you as a Layman you look for a trusted student of knowledge whom you follow and you trust his opinion his moral conduct his religious commitment and the rest and You Follow Him to guide you through this maze that confuses you but does not confuse him and whatever he chooses and tells you that this is the most authentic opinion of Scholars you follow that and then inshallah you'll be safe foreign"
