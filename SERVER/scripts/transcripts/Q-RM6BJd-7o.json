  "title": "Is it permissible to work for a company that overcharges clients & hospital? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "nabila from the UK my question is um so I work for a Healthcare Company who have clients prefer their employees when they get sick so sometimes the nurse would ask the department that I work in to get the patient's medical report from the hospital to assess them further now the hospital would charge the company for the report and then the company then would charge the client double than what they had paid to make a profit so is it permissible to work for such a company and would it be okay if I was to avoid doing tasks which required me to approve those types of transactions your company does what so they overcharge their clients they overcharge the hospital so so what what is your role is it only to investigate and to bring medical reports and data about a patient that is visiting a hospital and the hospital contacts you and says company X please investigate about patience so and so and get us his medical reports to know what uh the previous conditions he had you like majority of his admin so it's like answering emails booking appointments um speaking to doctors things like that so it includes other work as well so you do not actually work for an insurance company but rather you are being outsourced by the hospital itself exactly so it's it's a private healthcare company no problem no no problem whatever they charge the patient this is no problem because you're getting your work pay either from the hospital or from the patient and this is permissible inshallah foreign"
