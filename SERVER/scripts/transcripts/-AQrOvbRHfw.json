  "title": "Why do we refer to Allah as “Him” assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mustafa from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, how are you? Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah, I am fine. JazakAllah Khair. I have a question that why we call Allah him? Why we refer Allah as him? Allah Azza Wa Jal does not have a gender but due to the fact that in Arabic and in English we have two genders, masculine and feminine. So we refer to Allah Azza Wa Jal with the most prominent, most honourable and the higher of both of each and that is the masculine pronoun. This is what Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala used in the Qur'an to describe himself. So we stick with that and we use it and Allah knows best."
