  "title": "Is repentance valid if he repents for Kufr but not Minor sins that he is not ready to leave?",
  "transcript": "Miraj from Bangladesh Can you hear me? No, I can't. So if someone commits a lot of minor sins and also good for and he wants to revert back to Islam, if he doesn't ask forgiveness for all of his minor and major sins because he thinks he doesn't have the right amount of remorse for that or he is not ready to leave that sin right now, if he only feels remorse and only asks forgiveness for his kufr, is his repentance invalid because he didn't ask? This is a difference of opinion among scholars and personally I believe that people who revert back to Islam, Allah forgives their kufr and their apostasy, but their sins that they've committed, they are still held accountable for until they seek forgiveness and remorse and show remorse from them. If you refrain from what you used to do in the past, then it would be forgiven as Allah says, But while repenting from kufr and still insisting on watching pornography and listening to music and not being remorseful over that, this does not count and as I said it's an issue of dispute amongst scholars, but this is what I'm inclined to and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. you"
