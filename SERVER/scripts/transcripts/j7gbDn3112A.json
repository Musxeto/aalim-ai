  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Iran. Sheikh I want consolation on an issue that I've \nbeen overthinking for past few days I've been   accepted in a university that it is in a town \nthree or four hours away from our hometown,   and you know my university is in a town which is \nfrom a Shia region in Iran, and it's the one of   the biggest centres of Shia, there's absolutely no \nSunni Masjid, no population, no centre, nothing,   so last semester I spent in university and \nI prayed Jama'ah only once and that was the   opportunity that I could lead one of the Shia \nroommates in prayer, so you know I feel my heart   gets hard in that situation also you know living \nwith corrupt roommates and hustles, you know   getting attracted to girls when you're alone and \nfar from family, so that's an issue and a problem   that I have, our hometown which Alhamdulillah is \nfrom the Sunni region of Iran, we have many many   many Sunni Masjids, I can pray five times a day \neasily, we have an open university which you know   the degree of this university of our town has less \nvalue compared to the government universities,   but you know when I think of it, you know here \nI have better atmosphere around with people   of Ahlassunnah Wal Jama'ah I can pray five times \na day, so I thought that is it advisable for me to   you know quit my current university from the \nShia town and move to this university here. I will answer you Insha Allah. [Questioner] from Iran, his question is \ndisheartening to know that Muslims, specifically   Sunnis, and when we say Muslims we mean Sunnis \nbecause they are the vast majority of Muslims,   can pray anywhere in this world, I think even \nin the Vatican maybe you'll find a prayer hall   in their maybe I don't know, but when you come to \na so-called Muslim country like Iran you will not   find a Masjid for them, you will not find a place \nto pray Jumu'ah for them, if you go to the capital   of Iran you will not find a place for the Sunnis \nto pray except if you go to the embassies,   so if you go to the Saudi embassy or to \nthe Kuwaiti or the Qatari embassy you will   be able to pray Jumu'ah there, but this is \nunheard of it's very sad, however Abdullah says   there are two options to study, in a different \ncity four hours away which is dominated by Shia,   not a single Masjid as usual and there \nis a lot of Fitna and I feel my heart   Is becoming hard and \nstiff, and my Imaan is decreasing rapidly, or I can stay in my hometown which is dominated by \nSunnah with the grace of Allah, and we can pray in   with the Jama'ah and congregation \naccording to Ahlassunnah wal-jama'ah,   but the quality of teaching, the academia, \nand the university is lower, Akhi nothing can compromise your Imaan, no wealth, no \nhigher education, nothing, your Imaan, your Islam,   comes first over everything, so in a heartbeat \ntake your decision and go back to your hometown,   be among your Jama'ah, pray like the Muslims \npray and be away from Fitna and Insha Alllah,   Allah will compensate you for the \nlack of quality in that university."
