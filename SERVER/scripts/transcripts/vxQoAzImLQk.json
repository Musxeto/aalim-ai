  "title": "Scholar in India says covering head for men is Sunnah, why do Arabs cover head if its not Sunnah?",
  "transcript": "[] from India. My question is the famous preacher from subcontinent says we are covering head for many sunnah and he also quoted some authentic hadith from Sahih Muslim Volume 2 Book of Hajj and he says Prophet Muhammad ﷺ after conquering Mecca he gives speech in black turban wearing covering with black turban and he also says Prophet Muhammad ﷺ always used to cover his head so he says covering head is sunnah and my friend says Gulf Shayuk says it's cultural then why they always cover their heads? Thank you sir Jazak Allah Khairan. Jazak Allah Khairan Akhi with all due respect this is not true. The Shayuk wear this because it's a cultural thing they're not wearing a turban the Prophet used to wear a turban he did not wear this Ghotra or this Shumag so you can object to this also the Prophet did not wear a Kufi he wore a turban with a Dhuaba so if you want to follow the sunnah follow it the right way or don't claim it's sunnah. Thirdly I wear this only when I come to make my program or when I go for Friday Khutbah or Eid Khutbah 24 hours I don't have anything on my head you can say it's topless but people would understand it the wrong way so yes I don't wear anything on my head because it's a cultural thing and the culture now has changed. Fourthly the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam always rode a mule and sometimes a camel but he used to commute within Medina basically on a mule so would I say that this is a sunnah would I say that wearing a Izhar a waist wrapper which the Prophet used to wear alayhis salam and all the Arabs is a sunnah come on give me a break there is a difference between saying it's a sunnah meaning that the Prophet recommended it and said if whoever does this has this and this reward and Allah would put him in Jannah etc and between what the Prophet did alayhis salatu wasalam out of customs the Arabs used to braid their hair men so would we say that this is a sunnah of course not therefore we have to look into the things that are backing it up putting all of this aside what I always condemn and criticize not wearing the kufi 24 hours 7 this is your preference there's no problem in that if you want to do it I wouldn't say it's sunnah but it's totally permissible what I condemn and criticize is that when you come to the salat you take a handkerchief or a piece of towel or anything and you place it on your head to pray with it as if you are a woman ordered to cover your hair and this is totally bogus and not from Islam so I hope this makes some sense and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and be it in the last so I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all"
