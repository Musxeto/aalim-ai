  "transcript": "[Music] sheikh could you please tell me what is the nicest and most diplomatic way to disobey our parents when they are asking us to do something haram like for example to find them some movie on the internet etc how can we disobey our parents in the most diplomatic and polite way when they order us to do something haram such as to download a movie for them or to help them make a sin you unfortunately have to do what you have to do sometimes there is no other way or solution than just simply to draw the line and you explain to them with total respect and uh um diplomacy that you order me and i'm obliged to obey you and allah orders me and i am obliged to obey him so who do you think i should obey as a priority they will tell you allah so in this case tell them unfortunately allah azza tells me not to cooperate or collaborate with you on sin and what you're asking me to do dear father or dear mother is sinful so i beg your pardon and i ask your permission not to do this because i don't want to end up in hell and put a full stop at the end of your sentence no matter what they want or say or do you cannot compromise your religion and you have to remain steadfast you"
