  "title": "Islamic Banking: Signing documents before the Bank has full ownership? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I meant from Morocco hello yes Mohammed I want to ask you a question about the so-called Islamic banks in Morocco they are called participating banks okay they make you if you want to get for example an apartment they make you to define a document before the prank is put ownership of the pain okay so is it permissible to go to a bank and find that document before I mean the bank to get to the ownership okay I would answer in sha allah brother mohammad question and he's from morocco is about what is called Islamic banks and I have spoken about Islamic banks so many times not every bank that puts Islamic to it name or title is truly Islamic a lot and I'm really emphasizing this and reiterating it a lot of banks are not Islamic they have a Sharia board with PhD holders with names and and famous maybe but they just simply sign on what is on paper they don't know what's going on in reality they don't go into the transactions of the back so they sit in their big offices and the bank the corporate banking comes to them and say we have this scheme this Islamic window and it goes like this in that and the Sheikh who looks into it he says ok this sounds ok he signs and puts his stamps of course he gets usually a big bonus at the end not to discredit him I would have Allah he's a good scholar he is reliable but it's not sufficient to give the fatwa without going into details especially if they're going to use running your name is an asset my name is an asset if people use it and I'm unaware of it and look the other way this is not the right thing to do the scholar is supposed to go and check the transactions because they have his signed fatwa but they're not implementing it to the ledger they are bending the rules bits and pieces here and there so what's happening is like brother Mohammed from Morocco I go to the bank and I say listen there's this house there's this villa that I'm interested in buying and they said ok how much is it it's it's cost 1 million Derham so is it ok sign papers here that you're willing to pay it over the duration of 20 years and we will charge you 1.5 million dirham with a percentage of 50% and make a commitment that you are agree and you are liable in front of the law that you will buy it from us once we have acquisition of it and you sign this signature itself means that they are selling you something they do not possess because if you ask them okay before I sign do you own the property they say no once you sign we're gonna buy it okay if you gonna buy it and you're certain that I'll be forced to buy it from you might as well give me the money in cash and let me buy it and I'll give you the half-a-million interest over the period of 20 years this is not permissible and I personally ask sure bin abdul-aziz imagine sure how many they mean about this issue decades ago and they told me that this is totally prohibited there must be no obligation someone comes to me and say hey Hassan I'd like to buy this beautiful car but I don't have money so I said okay how much is it he says two hundred thousand reals is it okay if I buy it for you will you be committed to buying it from me with a percentage is definitely it's okay give me your guarantees give me two witnesses swear by Allah sign a paper or document or give me a down payment of twenty thousand reals any type of commitment makes the deal Haram and knows best"
