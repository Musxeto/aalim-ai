  "title": "Is Wudu compulsory for Tawaf? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "performing tawaf and this is an issue of dispute among scholars if we seek the evidence that backs up that would is mandatory we will fail to find anything that stands in a court of law so it is not mandatory it is recommended true but we cannot obligate people who come in their Millions to perform Tawaf for their Umrah and if someone passes wind if someone has to go it's difficult to leave the scrout go to the toilets perform Udo and come back again it's a nightmare so in order for me to obligate this and to put the next a burden on your shoulders I have to have evidence that is strong from the Quran or from the Sunnah and there's not a thing like that and this is the most authentic opinion that you can make wudu that you can make go off without being in the state of purity of course it's definitely better but it is not mandatory and your toe off is valid"
