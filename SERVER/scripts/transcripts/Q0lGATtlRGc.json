  "transcript": "the final question is from Zainab \nand she says is it obligory to   say (Peace and Blessings upon him) whenever we \nread or hear the Prophet's name or is it a Sunnah   this is an issue of dispute among Scholars \nAllah says in chapter 33 o you who believe praise him and offer him Salaam (Peace and \nBlessings upon him) so this is in an order   some Scholars said it's \nmandated once in a lifetime   but it is highly recommended some Scholars say \nno it is mandatory to offer salutation upon the   Prophet (Peace and Blessings upon him) whenever \nyou hear his name or whatever you mention his name   why because the Prophet (Peace and Blessings \nupon him) when he was stepping the steps when   he was climbing the steps of the pulpit a \nmember he was heard to say Amin Amin Amin   so the companion said what are you saying \nAmin to and he explained to them that Jibril   was addressing him with three supplications \none of them o Muhammad whoever your name is   mentioned in his presence and he doesn't offer \nsalutation upon you may Allah further him away   may Allah take him away meaning \nfrom his Mercy from his forgiveness   and this is a great sin so the Prophet said \nI mean therefore the scholars say that it is   mandatory whenever you hear his name (Peace and \nBlessings upon him) to offer salutation those best"
