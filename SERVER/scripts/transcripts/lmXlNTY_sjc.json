  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Australia so my question\nis that is it true that if a person persists in minor sins without repenting or turning\nback then that minor sin will turn into major sin this was stated by some Scholars that\ninsisting on minor sins make them major sins but I failed to find any evidence from the\nQuran or the Sunnah backing it up because the Quran clearly states that there are major\nsins and minor sins and Allah says if you avoid major sins minor sins are forgiven so\nthere isn't anything in between therefore I am inclined to say that this statement is\nnot correct insisting on doing minor sins does not make it evolve into major sins but\na person is sinful for insisting on it and Allah Knows Best foreign [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session\nwith me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you\ncan afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this\nis for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're\npoor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me\nand let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will\nuh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for All"
