  "title": "How a traveler prays Behind a local or Leads locals in prayer, is 100 km a traveling distance?",
  "transcript": "Sa'ad from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi I was in my mother's hometown a few months ago which is more than a hundred kilometers which is a traveling distance obviously and I visit it in like every two to three years in this case if I prayed or lead the prayer like as if I am a traveler which means two rakahs for the prayer is the prayer of me or my followers valid like basically I am asking that was I a traveler in that case because I visit it frequently. Visiting it every two to three years is not frequently, visiting it every couple of days is frequently first of all second of all if it is considered to be a traveling distance because 100 kilometers sometimes can be in the same city so if it's in the same city as in Mumbai for example then this is not traveling this is going to the outskirts or the suburbs and this is not traveling but if it's considered among the locals to be a traveling distance and that when they go to that area they usually pack and bid farewell to their relatives in this case what you've done is correct and that is shortening the four rakah prayers of Dhuhr, Asr and Isha and skipping the sunnah of Dhuhr, Maghrib and Isha but if you were to lead the locals there you would pray two rakahs and they would after you offer salam stand up to offer the third and fourth rakah because they cannot shorten they're not offering they're not travelers while if you were to pray behind a local you would be obliged to complete your prayer and pray for because your imam is praying for and Allah Azzawajal knows best"
