  "transcript": "Our first caller is Fahim from Bangladesh. Yes Sheikh, we know that guidance is in Allah's hands and He guides whom He wills but Sheikh for non-Muslims who are genuinely searching and want to understand the truth of Islam, could you please recommend some English books or audio tapes that explain the divinity of Islam so that it might help them realize that Allah is the only true God and Islam is the only true religion. JazakAllah. Wa Jazak. First of all Akhi, I have said this many times. Unfortunately, I don't read English at all and this is why I don't have any knowledge of what is printed and found out there for da'wah purposes. But I would highly recommend that you visit islamqa.info and this website has a lot of material on Islam in different languages including English of course and it's a reliable source. Also you can for non-Muslims visit usool.com which propagates and educates and teaches different topics on Islam in multiple languages and there are many other affiliated websites that provide you with material that is both reliable and free of charge insha'Allah."
