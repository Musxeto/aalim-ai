  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia allum alaykum Salam if someone if someone during fasting is picking his nose and because of that his nose starts to bleed is his fasting valid the fasting is valid because bleeding through an injury is not one of the things that invalidates fasting and every Muslim has to know the things that break his woodoo so that if anything else comes along he would know whether it breaks his wow or not for example if someone says I clipped my nails while in the state of woodoo does this impact My fasting once you know that your does this impact my woodoo once you know that there are five things that break your woodoo then anything that comes out of that would not have an impact likewise with fasting once you know that there are sick or seven things that break your fasting anything else is not included which also is referring to bleeding of the nose whether you're picking it or you're being punched in it it's the same concept"
