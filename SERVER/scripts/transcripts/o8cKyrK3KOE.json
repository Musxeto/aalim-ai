  "transcript": "Aisha from Saudi. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Okay so my question, I asked my question before but I think the internet was weak. Can you hear me now? Yes I can hear you loud and clear. Okay so my friend tells me about her husband, how she treats her different from her co-workers like mistreatment and it makes her feel more better like instead of bottling up the emotions, I do advise her to pray to Allah and like guide her to what to do but I'm scared of you know backbiting and slandering in Islam but does that come under it? If she's asking for advice, there is no backbiting in that. If she's just venting and mentioning how bad he is and how evil he is without any justification or response from your side, this would be backbiting. But as long as she's asking you for an advice or a solution to her problem, there's no backbiting inshallah in that."
