  "transcript": "a sister says during menses there are times we change our clothes if we are going outside or where abaya so is it required to wash these clothes though no impurity was present on them can we pray in such close this is a frequently asked question whether you are in the major state of impurity or on your menses your clothes are clean your sweat is not impure so it doesn't matter whether you wear it for the whole seven days or not once you're pure and take your russell you can put them on again and pray in them and go out with them because there is no physical impurity on them wearing them while you are in the state of major ritual impurity does not change the fact of the permissibility of wearing it afterwards"
