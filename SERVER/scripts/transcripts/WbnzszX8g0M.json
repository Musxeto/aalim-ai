  "transcript": "Aisha from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah. So my question is two days back I did my ghusl and I forgot to rinse my nose and mouth. After 10 minutes I remembered and I did it and I continued praying without knowing the validity of the ghusl. Is it considered as kufr and should I repeat the ghusl and pray once? When did you rinse your nose and mouth? What's the gap between your ghusl and rinsing them? Of about 10 minutes. It's about 10 minutes inshaAllah. It is acceptable though it would have been best for you to repeat the ghusl because rinsing the nose and the mouth is an issue of dispute whether it is mandatory or a highly recommended sunnah. The most authentic opinion is of course that it is mandatory in both wudu and ghusl. However due to the difference of opinion and due to the hardship that might be caused for those who are ignorant and have done it out of forgetfulness and out of ignorance, if it was done immediately afterwards, some in the school of thought that say that it is mandatory to rinse your nose and mouth, they say that the parts of ghusl, the sequence is not mandatory or known as al muwalat. So if you leave a gap like between tawaf and sa'i, if I make my tawaf in the morning and I go to my hotel room and I come in the evening to do my sa'i, they say it's okay because the muwalat, to have them done simultaneously is not a must. Some of the scholars say that this is applicable as well to ghusl, but the most authentic is that you should do it all at the same time. But due to your case, due to the 10 minutes gap, I pray inshaAllah that everything was fine and Allah knows best. you"
