  "transcript": "Adeeb from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh I recently saw on Twitter that some renowned students of knowledge are promoting Quran known as Salafi Quran and it is an English translation. They are promoting what? A Salafi Quran. What is a Salafi Quran? There is no such thing as a Salafi Quran. Yes Sheikh they translated the Quran and they translated it well but the head of the Quran is known as Salafi Quran. So is it valid for me to read it? I have no idea Akhi. You have to go through it and revise the entire Quran and see if the translation is accurate and um appropriate because this is not a game. Everybody could hold the Quran and translate it and their English is not equipped to that level and their Aqeedah is not as well. So I can't give my opinion unless we can go and look into it and read it from cover to cover and Allah knows best."
