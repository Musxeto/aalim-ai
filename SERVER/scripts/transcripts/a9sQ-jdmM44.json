  "transcript": "Kasumba from Uganda Kasumba Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is about giving salam to someone who is praying. Is it only done in Faruq prayers? Okay. It is permissible to give salam to someone who is praying. So if I enter a room and there is only my brother praying and I say Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah. Of course because he's praying he's not going to reply to me. But the sunnah for him is to wave his hand by saying this. Because this is how the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam used to reply to people when they give salam to him while praying. So this is totally permissible and legit."
