  "transcript": "I've got a question here, an interesting question because you see it happen in society. It's a societal problem really. So sometimes you see people laughing at other people and those people don't know. So for example, somebody's walking by and a group of people are laughing at this person. This kind of action, it's a sinful action because you're mocking somebody. But the people involved in this, sometimes they don't actually believe they're mocking. They think that person doesn't actually know what we're laughing at. We haven't mocked him in front of people. So they justify this. Is there actually any justification for this kind of action, Shaf? Unfortunately, there are no justifications to this, none whatsoever. The Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, told us that backbiting is mentioning your brother with something that he dislikes when he's not present. So if my brother, my friend, my Muslim brother is short, and this is a fact, and I talk to you and he's not present, and I tell you that our brother so and so is so short, you need to irrigate him so that he may grow up a little bit. So this is short, that's true, that's a fact. This is backbiting, even if it's true. And also the Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, told us that, و, which is ويل, and ويل is, they say, it's a valley in hell that is so deep and the fluids and the blood's running through it. So the Prophet is saying to us that this valley, ويل, is to those who talk to make others laugh. ويل له may wu be to him twice or thrice. So this means that those comics who come and make fun of people, they take the biggest portion of this because they're making people laugh on others. And likewise, these people mocking and ridiculing this brother because of his size, his height, his color, or whatever, because he does not know this, this is backbiting, and it is a major sin. It's not a minor sin that can be overlooked. It's a major sin, and on the Day of Judgment, Allah will give him, from their good deeds, the sufficient amount to compensate for their aggression and their sin."
