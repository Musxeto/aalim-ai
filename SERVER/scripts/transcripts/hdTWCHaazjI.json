  "title": "Must I inform buyers of haram aspects like insurance or late fees when helping my father sell a flat",
  "transcript": "Our first caller today is Gule from Turkey. Possible, but I'm not sure. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Yes, so my father owns a flat which is within a compound. And I am usually the one responsible for the costs related to this flat. And in this flat, in this compound, there is for example a pre-mixed swimming pool. And also the management of the compound forces people to pay late payment fees, which is very frequent in this country. And moreover, recently they introduced some kind of insurance for all the common areas of the compound. So they put insurance in it. And they force all homeowners to contribute to this. So if in order to get rid of the flat, I help my father to sell it, do I have personally to tell every potential buyer that there are some haram things associated with the flat? Or can I just help him to sell it and don't do anything? What should I do in this situation? You have no obligation to tell anyone anything because this is the law of the country. And these are the rules of the compound and those who live in it. You just simply put it for sale and whoever comes and buys it, they can do their due diligence and ask around. But you don't have to sell them. You do not have to tell them anything. Just sell it and move on. For more information, visit www.fema.gov"
