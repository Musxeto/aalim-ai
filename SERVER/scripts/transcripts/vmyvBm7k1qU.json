  "transcript": "the next question is from a brother is it necessary to tell the potential groom that the girl is suffering from some reproductive problems of course if the groom or the bride have a medical issue or something physically that would be repulsive or a cause of thinking twice before getting engaged it has to be laid on the table i cannot marry someone without telling her that listen i have the following problems i'm impotent maybe or i have hiv positive or i have a genital herpes or i have um an immune deficiency illness that causes me to fall sick every five six days or i have hepatitis i think plus two one four i don't know the numbers hamdi lamella cures all these affect the permission process from the girl and from her parents and likewise if i propose to a girl and she doesn't tell me that she has a medically offensive odor in her mouth and this is mentioned in the books of even if a man has this he must not attend the prayer it cannot go with brushing and eating mint etc this is something chronic so this affects my marriage if she does not bear children cannot conceive or has problems that makes getting pregnant down into two to 25 percent for example no i have to know up in advance if she has literacy in her back or in her body uh something that is a deformity that would make me you know a bit really repulsive of how she looks no she i have to be told now i'm not talking about probabilities maybe not something that impacts the marriage if she's diabetic for example this has no impact on the marriage or she if i'm high blood pressure uh patient this uh hypertension this has no issues in marriage insha allah but things that are related to marriage that would must be put on the table online those best questions"
