  "transcript": "Medina from Germany so my friend she is like shaffy and she kind of doesn't know where to ask so do you do you know if the shaffy mat have allows combining M and Isha in types of hardship for example when the time between Isha and F is like way too short unfortunately no I don't have knowledge in this the knowledge I have is from the Quran and the Sunnah and from the scholars that I follow such Asin and the likes and they say that whenever there's hardship and the hardship is real and a person between praying on time and F is like three hours or a little bit less a little bit more and he knows that he will miss F due to his inability to wake up in this case there is is the concession of combining to at time and going to bed early so that one is able to pray fer on time and Allah Knows Best"
