  "title": "In Masjids, the Muathin switches place with the Imam, should we also do this at home",
  "transcript": "he stands in the place of the imam then um he moves back so the imam can take his place so if you're praying at home in the jamaa the kamikaz does then have to stand in the place of the imam like could they do the name from turkey she uh he says that in the masjid usually usually the calls the adhan and in the place of the imam and when he finishes he switches his place with the imam so should we do this home the answer is no what is being done is simply because of convenience they have only one microphone which is the one used by the imam so when the adhan and the kama is to be called the same microphone is used by the advent after he finishes he retreats so the imam comes forward i've seen in masjids elsewhere where they have two microphones a stand for the imam and another one for the advent so the mother makes the call for the salat and the akama and the imam is standing in his normal place because there are two microphones so there is no nothing related to this when praying home and allah knows best"
