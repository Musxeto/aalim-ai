  "title": "Impact of certain Quran chapters on the Prophet assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Some chapters of the Quran made a huge impact on the Prophet ï·º to the extent that he said once Hud, Surat Hud, Al Waqia, Al Mursalat, Amma Yatasaloon, Surat An-Naba, and Idha Al-Shamsu Kuwwirat, Surat Al-Takwir, these surahs have made my hair turn grey. Such surahs included the description, the detailed descriptions of the Day of Judgment and it was frightening, it still is to those who ponder and contemplate. So the Prophet said that such description of the Day of Judgment made my hair turn grey because of my reaction to such surahs."
