  "transcript": "Arik from Bangladesh Okay, so Sheikh, my question is, if I go to the masjid at the time of Fajr and I pray Fajr in congregation and then I stay in the masjid till it's time for Ishaq, making dhikr and dua, and then if I come home and pray two rakah of Ishaq, would I still get the reward of Hajj and Umrah or do I have to pray two rakah in the masjid? No, if you did not pray the two rakahs in the masjid, you don't get the reward because the hadith is a package deal. If you pray Fajr in the masjid in the congregation and stay until the sun rises by 10 or 15 minutes and remembering Allah, reading the Quran, making dua, and then you leave. You did not complete the package because the package said, then he prays two rakahs, meaning in the masjid. But if you go and pray them home, no, you don't get the reward and Allah knows best."
