  "title": "Do parents who allow their children to sin get the SAME sin? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "um cd from germany um jeff last time i asked to ask you a question about the ruling of parents who are allowing their children to commit this in and i actually wanted to know in this question if the parents will get the same sidney i need the same deeds in the same punishment what their children committed and for example missing a prayer is a grave major sin and this for example a mother and a father who are always bringing the praise on time and never miserably but they are allowing their children to miss the pressure player deliberately so would they get also the same major sin and the same punishment of missing a prayer deliberately what their children committed even though they themselves didn't commit that physically from germany he's asking are the parents sinful exactly as the sin of the children if they facilitated it first of all this is in allah's hands are they sinful or not definitely they're sinful but for example if the parents facilitate it for the children to install a receiver in their bedroom and a tv set so that they can watch movies and listen to music will the parents get exactly the same sins that the children are involved in this is in allah's hands and most likely such parents wouldn't care because they don't care about punishment of allah otherwise they would not have indulged in it in the first place nevertheless it is something that is in allah's hands some scholars say that yes they get exactly identical since others say no they didn't do the sin so they don't get exactly the same but they get a huge portion similar to it"
