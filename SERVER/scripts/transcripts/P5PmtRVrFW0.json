Okay, first of all, first of all, I know exactly what you want so I'm just saving the time for the program. Parents have duties and responsibilities while at the same time they have rights in or towards them from their children. And the children have rights and responsibilities they should get from their parents but they also have rights to give and offer to their parents. If the parents are abusive, controlling, not understanding, not fearing Allah Azza wa Jal, trying their level best to destroy the marriage or the marital life of their sons or their daughters, doing whatever toxic means they have in their possession to be abusive mentally, verbally, whatever, they will be held accountable on the Day of Judgment. Allah has already stripped them from any mercy, from any tranquility. Such beasts live among us. Yes, there are parents, unfortunately, they are our test from Allah. But they are beasts and I have thousands of counseling sessions with such couples who suffer from such parents. All what they want is to enslave their daughter-in-law or to suffocate their sons and take the breath out of his lungs. Just for the sake of control and they will curse and they will do whatever in their position. They are beasts! Nevertheless, your obligation as a child to obey them, to be respectful to them, to try your level best, to be dutiful. But when the line is drawn, they cannot transgress against their children or their spouses. And we have to draw the line. So, I hope this answers."
