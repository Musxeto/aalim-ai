  "transcript": "Nazar from India shake the IM of the Masjid unite the attendee after every F prayer slightly turn from the direction of kah and SS a poetry for our beloved prophet in which he reached to the phrase where he says oh our Prophet you are our razak and gafar and from you it starts and to you it end and you so is praying Salah behind such IM considered to be valid or void again our manh and our AA is unlike the where we hear something and we label an individual as cfir or mush this is not the case there are people who are ignorant there are people who are repeating things without knowing their uh the meaning of it so there are conditions that must be fulfilled in order for us to check the boxes of labeling an individual as a cafir and there are obstacles that must be unchecked so that when there are no obstacles then we can label an individual as a cafir he might be ignorant he might be forc he might might be misinterpreting go and speak to the Imam and tell him do you know anyone who is r other than Allah so why are you saying that the prophet is the provider and everything begins from him and ends to him this is Allah and if he says no no no the prophet is like this and you have to explain it to him that this is kufur and you're making shik and this is totally unacceptable if he's added and insisting after shown all these evidences in this case yes you cannot pray behind him"
