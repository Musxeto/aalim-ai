  "transcript": "Sad man from Bangladesh. Sheikh, what's the ruling on a person who is just randomly talking to a person and suddenly he says one or two bad things about a third party guy and then suddenly I try to change the topic to about backbiting. Will I be sinful? You have to defend your Muslim brothers when they're mentioned in a bad way in a conversation that you're involved in. So if someone while talking with him normally all of a sudden mentions brother so and so and he says that he's stingy, he's fat, he's this, he's that. You have to correct him and say Akhi, fear Allah this is ghibah, this is backbiting. No the brother is generous if he's not stingy for real but if he is stingy for real he said you're not allowed to say these things, so refrain. And if he doesn't you move on and leave him. But to turn a blind eye as if you did not hear a thing and let this slip and go away, no this is inappropriate and you would be sinful for that."
