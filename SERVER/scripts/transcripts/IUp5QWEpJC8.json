  "transcript": "Sadia says can we say Ameen to the doors that we make for ourselves and also can we say Ameen to the drawers that we make for others first of all what is the meaning of Amin Amin is well-known to be said after the Fatiha so when we supplicate by reading it saying Adina's wrote al-mustaqim guide us to the straight path then we say I mean and it means all Lord answer and respond to our supplication and to our request and this is why scholars say that whenever someone makes dua you say I mean as asking Allah to answer and accept so someone says may Allah forgive the Muslim Ummah may Allah grant them success in this life in the hereafter and you say I mean there is no problem in that the problem is when you make dua for yourself is it part of the Sunnah to say I mean never we heard the Prophet Allah so salam saying it after any of his duong so for example o turner's of heart make my heart steadfast on your religion this is dua never we heard the Prophet say Allison I mean and all of his drawers which means that it is not part of the Sunnah yet the general concept is that Amin is said to ask Allah to respond and answer therefore if someone says it and he does this after his own door I would not say it's Haram but it is not part of the Sunnah and definitely following the Sunnah is the best what about saying I mean to other people's draw there's no problem in that so even if the Imam is doing dua in Juma in Friday sermon we see I mean but we do not raise our voices to fill up the whole Masjid we just say something like a me so that I can hear it and in Friday's we do not raise our hands like a lot of the people do neither the Imam nor the followers he makes dua and if he wants he may point with his index finger so allahumma is that Islam I will mostly mean Allah humma humma a la mulana no problem but not like this and the followers do not raise their hands as well except in one simple condition that the Prophet used to do a lot of sin in one simple situation and that is when the Imam is making dua for rain so when the Imam says allahumma aspinall rathore Allah grant us rain so the congregation raised their hands and say I mean this is the Sunnah other than that on a Friday prayer in the Friday sermon you do not raise your hands if someone is leading the prayer in whitter like we do in taraweeh and the mmm is Allah Medina femen had eight he raises his hands the congregation raised their hands and they say Amin so this is permissible and there is nothing wrong in that"
