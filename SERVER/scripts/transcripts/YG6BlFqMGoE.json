  "transcript": "I have one question is what is your view what is your Islamic view on self defense I don't understand what is your Islamic view on self defense self-defense unless you're asking about martial arts and learning these things what do you mean by self-defense like for example let's say you're walking on the road and someone tries like he tries robbing you for example okay and you have a gun license or something like that or what would you do like are you allowed to kill him okay this is a legitimate question if someone tries to rob me can I kill them the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was addressed with a similar question oh prophet of Allah a man wants to stake my money the prophet said don't give him the man said the man man fights me over it the prophet says fight back the man says the man kills me the prophet says you're a martyr the man says I kill him the prophet said he's in hell this is Hadith huh so it's straightforward now Scholars said that when someone attacks you and you have a gun he wants to take your money your wallet you don't shoot him between the eyes this is last stage you threaten him listen stay away I will not give you my wallet and if you come closer I'm going to shoot you he proceeds to attack and to try to take your wallet shoot him in the leg he still crawls to you what is this zombie shoot him in the arm he still crawls to you he's going to harm you and kill you then you can kill him which means that you don't go to defon four or five no you take it step by step to eliminate the harm and danger and this is the logical thing we're not bloodthirsty we just go and kill and harm people no we protect ourselves with the minimum power uh uh possible but if at the end of the day there's no other alternative but than to kill you are Licensed to Kill 7 the next question"
