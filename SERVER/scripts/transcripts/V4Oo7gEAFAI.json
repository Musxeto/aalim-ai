  "transcript": "uh instagram from australia uh sheikh i was wondering if someone is making the final version of muslim to uplift a major impurity is the wardrobe that is um there still intact if they clean their private parts after covering themselves with the water and then rinsing them out and taking the water up the nose okay first of all this is an issue of dispute whether touching the private part invalidates the wudu or not and i am inclined to follow the opinion of sheikh bin atheim may allah have mercy on his soul who took a middle stance because we have uh two seemingly contradicting hadith one says that it invalidates wudu and one says it's part of your body so it does not impact your wudu so hadith of us which one to take so to to combine both hadiths without rejecting one of uh one of them uh the shaykh nathameen says that touching your private part with lust and desire breaks so in the case of having a hustle and you wash your private part this is not applicable because nobody does this out of desire and lust it's just to clean it secondly if you're doing what you called quote unquote foreign to uplift a ritual in major ritual impurity as in the case of janaba or immenses for women so if you're doing this and following the sunnah you do not get in touch with your private part except in the very very beginning before you perform mudo so you're safe hypothetically assuming you didn't you're not following the sequence of the sunnah so you're just taking a shower with the intention of uplifting your major ritual impurity while rinsing your mouth and nose and during the process you may touch your private part insha allah your wado is intact and allah knows best you"
