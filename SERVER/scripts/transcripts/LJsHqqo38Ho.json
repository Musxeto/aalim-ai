  "transcript": "my brother says my mother has this habit of cursing me whenever i make her upset for example if i'm having exams she'll say you will fail your exam or you will never get what you ask for i'm not sure if this is considered as cursing i've already told my mom to stop saying that as i feel that it might come true sometimes if she keeps on repeating it should i be worried about this first of all for you my friend as long as you did not do anything wrong and you are with allah azzawajal your mother dua it's not cursing it's dua against you insha allah would not be heard so maintain your atkar in the morning in the evening and try your level best to be dutiful and obedient to your mother as much as possible without crossing the boundaries without crossing any red lines or doing something haram as for your mother unfortunately there are people there are parents who are toxic and i get many of such cases and i've seen personally and encountered many parents who are toxic to their children they don't fear allah azza such parents think that just because their parents they can do whatever they want they can abuse torture physically and mentally and mentally their children they think that they can ruin their lives they think that they own the right to give them a life or to take it away from them and all of this is totally haram what they're doing is a major sin and they are forcing their children to be not dutiful to them or to say bad things to them and this is not what allah wants allah azzawajal put in the parents hearts the love and compassion to their children the tolerance and patience towards their children not the opposite unfortunately we get mothers who abuse their daughter-in-law just because they were abused when they got married 40 years ago by their in-laws they want to cascade this awful trent a tradition to her daughter-in-law and this is haram she doesn't care whether her her son is happy or not even if this causes his marriage to break she could care less this is not a mother this is a monster such a woman will definitely face allah azza judgment and will pay for her behavior and there's no justification for that so bear with your mom and tolerate her and be kind to her but she will face her actions on the day of judgment and you will face your actions on the day of judgement as long as you're not doing anything haram then you have nothing to worry about inshallah"
