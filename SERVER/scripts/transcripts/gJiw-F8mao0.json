  "transcript": "Ubadah from Syria. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, I have a question that like, so when I tell someone to do something that Allah loves, for instance, give charity, like I taught him that I get rewarded if he does it, right? Correct. So if I, for instance, asked you a question, how many rakat before Fajr, you said two, and somebody learned that from my question, do I also get rewarded? Or if I asked you for a book recommendation and somebody heard it and read it, do I get rewarded? Allah Azza Wa Jal is the most generous, Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala. Is it difficult for Allah to grant you a reward for something that you had intended with good intention to benefit the Muslims? The answer is no. It's not difficult at all. So we deal with Allah through His beautiful name, Al-Jawad Al-Kareem. So you think highly of Allah, and Allah is as you think of Him."
