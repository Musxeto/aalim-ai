  "title": "Can we take Student Loan due necessity? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the next question is from brother alan gravy uh he is from germany and he is currently studying in the uk where he is contemplating to take a loan for his studies or not and he's saying that i could either study and you can't take the loan or i could go back to my home country which is germany and study there for free and he is his question is how do you define necessity i mean if i can take a loan here the condition is such that if i do not repay it back i will have to pay the interest first of all there is a rule in islam which states necessities render prohibitions permissible example a woman must cover from head to toe she has stomach ache a doctor a male doctor is only available at this time and it's an emergency it is permissible to be examined by a male doctor and he may touch and maybe see the area which is our aura this is a necessity however this rule is governed by another rule what is a necessity must be estimated according to its actual size meaning a woman who's wearing hijab from head to toe goes to the dentist and takes off all of her clothes so what are you doing woman she says it's a necessity my tooth aches your tooth aches but why are you stripping you have something wrong in you so yes she can expose the area that is needed the tooth the ear the stomach but not the rest of the the uh the body so if a woman goes to a dentist she unveils her mouth so he can work but what why does she unveil her nose and and eyes and hair there's no need for that so we go back to our uh friend from germany and we say e so we say you do acknowledge that taking an interest-based loan is totally prohibited and reba yes or no says so if this is true and you know it's one of the seven major sins in islam let us look at the necessity is it a matter of life and death no is it something that would permit you to do something haram no i could work without studying i can be an uber driver i can deliver pizza halal pizza i can work as a janitor no matter what i do because my time on earth is limited so i have few years then i'll die and then it is paradise for eternity or hell for eternity it's your choice so i would tell you definitely taking interest-based loans is totally out of the question taking mortgage to live in a house is totally out of the question because mortgages alone based on interest i am almost 60 years of age and i'm living in rent i don't possess a land i don't have a house to live in i pay rent like everybody else and i'm happy with that people say okay with the money you have paid the past 40 years you could have bought two houses said yes but i don't have the money to buy two houses and i'm not willing at all to participate in an interest-based loan after all these years and end up going to hell for that so i hope this answers your question"
