  "transcript": "uh women to stay home i wanted to ask the guiding plants for that like staying home like dude necessity if you want to go out okay from turkey she says in suratul allah says to the mothers of the believers so what does this mean so verse 33 chapter 33 allah addresses the mothers of the believers who stay home and they used to do that until the prophet abrogated this ruling by telling them that allah has permitted you to go and do your errands answer the call of nature do what is needed to go out so they used to go out this ayah highly recommends that women stay home because this is their safe haven with their spouses with the children with their family and not to go out unless there's a necessity such as attending school going to the hospital shopping visiting friends or relatives um something that they have a need for one would ask okay so what is wrong in what people are doing nowadays now the way women are getting out of the home every single day why they're fed up so they go to malls not to buy anything just to wander around and they have to stay like six seven hours out of the house every single day just for the sake of staying out of the the house this is not permissible this is not part of the sunnah and one would say okay why men do this men do this often out of necessity to work to earn to put food on the table and to do what is needed to be done and this is why usually the man's place is out of the home and the woman's place is inside the home so this is something that muslim women should balance you"
