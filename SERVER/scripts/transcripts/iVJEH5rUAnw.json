  "transcript": "Armaan from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Please Sheikh listen my question fully I try to pronounce them correctly since I know they are Makaraj, but I'm not perfect in it yet I don't know what counts as my best so I keep repeating them during prayer I trying again and again However, they still aren't pronounced perfectly and because of this praying become very difficult for me. What should I do Sheikh? You have one of two options You can leave the prayer altogether and not pray and this is exactly what Shaitaan is pushing you to do And it's very very strange and weird how people keep on listening to the whispers of Shaitaan every single day multiple times All of a sudden they've discovered that oh the Makaraj is not valid it's not correct and they keep on repeating the same word or the same verse and Sometimes they nullify the Salat Assalamu Alaikum And repeat it again and again and again 50 times a day Why? Because Shaitaan is sitting there laughing his head on you. He's laughing Look how stupid he is. He's repeating the prayer because I'm telling him and he's oblivious. He's crazy this is what Shaitaan is doing to you and You have the audacity to listen to Shaitaan Not only that to obey him and When you please Shaitaan by obeying him, guess what? Allah is angry and Not only that you have lost The sweetness of Salat. You don't enjoy Salat. It's become a burden and it's a struggle and It will soon come to an end where you will abandon Salat altogether. This is exactly what Shaitaan does To you, so you have one of two choices either to ignore Shaitaan and Not listen to him and you can do that by usually having a counseling session with me if you can afford it where I'll talk you out of it or You obey him and listen to him and make life difficult which will lead eventually to you Leaving Salat may Allah protect us all You"
