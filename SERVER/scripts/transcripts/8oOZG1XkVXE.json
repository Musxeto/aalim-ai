  "transcript": "Khurram from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh how are you feeling today? I'm feeling great Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Sheikh this is a question for a female from a female in her own words On the 11th day of my period when I checked inside with tissue I didn't see any prominent colored discharge but tiny brown granules like tiny dots which seemed like remains of menstrual cloth If on the 12th day there were very tiny just one or two dots like tip of the needle but on the 13th and 14th day they were again comparatively bigger and prominent in size Now if these granules continue even after the 15th day should she simply take bath on 15th day and start praying or would she have to make up for the previous days too if that will be categorized as Istihad No she should perform her ghusl on the 15th day without making up any of her prayers but if this continues on she should only stop for the duration of her usual period in the past but from now on because of these 15 days that she was in doubt she must not make up any prayer but on the 15th day she makes her ghusl and starts to pray and makes wudu for every prayer when the adhan is called and she can resume her normal life when the time of the month where she usually gets her period and this continues with her this is the time where she should stop for 7 or 8 days as she used to do before and afterwards she should take ghusl immediately and continue to pray and consider herself as Istihadah because this is continuous all the month around Thanks for watching!"
