  "transcript": "Rock is asking about paper money or currency is it halal to use or is it something out of necessity meaning without it we are unable to behave we cannot we have to do this in order to get it over with what is the reason of asking such a question usually because there is those who come and make you videos YouTube videos saying that these paper currencies or money is worthless it has no backing it has no value and this is all from the Dajjal and they start making yeah any a Bollywood movie out of it and to tell you the truth until recently maybe like 30 or 40 years ago each currency was backed by silver or gold so actually when you gave that currency you got in return for it silver or gold until 30 or 40 years ago they stopped this and now it has become sort of printing currency but this does not mean it has no value the currency as it stands today is backed by the country issuing it it is backed by the central bank it is backed by the financial institutions worldwide so it's not like Bitcoin something out of the blue coming and and making this big great bubble no this is something that all Muslims and non-muslims alike they agree that this banknote this currency where is a really euro a dollar a yen or whatever they all agree that it is worse it is worth so and so that we can buy it has a buying power purchasing power you can buy things with you can sell things with it and it is not a commodity people acknowledge it as a currency so my point of view is that is totally Harlan Barack you and others if you guys have any doubt in it I'll send you my bank account you can deposit all what you have are doubtful in it you get rid of it I'll do a lot of good things inshallah and maybe some bad things Allah knows best but this is not logical this is what everyone on earth is dealing with so to come and say that is it halal or a necessity well either way we have to deal with it until the something different happens and people go back to dealing with gold and currency which was the case centuries ago and a larger real knows best"
