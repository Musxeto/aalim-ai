  "transcript": "Brother Sadman from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? Nafeer Khud, Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah, Sheikh I have a question, so basically I wanted to ask you about the concept of Zuhr, like the detachment from the world and maybe if you could give us an example, like if you practice it, how do you practice it practically? What kind of concept Akhi, I did not get you It's called Zuhr, in Arabic I think it's called Zuhr or in English it's called detachment from the world, worldly affairs Zuhr, okay, with a D in the end It's a D in the end, Z-I-H-U-D, Zuhr, Z-U-H-U-D, okay, I will answer you Inshallah So basically speaking, Zuhr is to detach yourself from worldly matters that do not get you close to Allah Azza Wa Jal Now, War'a is different because War'a is not to do something for the fear of falling into sin So, hmm, this is halal, haram, I don't know, might as well leave it, this is War'a Zuhr is, this is halal, but I'm not going to consume it because it's not going to get me closer to Allah It would delay my journey to Allah Azza Wa Jal So basically speaking, a person who is in the state of Zuhr would most likely not be indulged in buying fancy cars, big mansions, investing a lot of money because he feels that this derails his journey to Allah Azza Wa Jal Not that poverty is good for him, not that he doesn't enjoy these things, but he feels that it may delay his progress towards being a righteous, God-fearing individual So, this concept has to be governed by a number of factors For example, knowing what Allah made halal and what Allah made haram Knowing what we may think that it is good to stay away from, while in reality, this is shaytan trying to make life difficult for us So if you look at the Prophet's way of life, he was the master of all Az-Zuhad, he was the best in Zuhd Allah gave him the choice between being a prophet and a king, or a messenger and a servant, and he chose the latter Jibreel came and said, if you wish, I can turn this Hasba of Makkah into gold, just for you So you'll be the richest man ever to walk the earth when you have all of this gold for you And he declined, he could have lived like a king, he could have lived like a wealthy billionaire But he chose to live like a servant of Allah Azzawajal, where food would not be cooked in his nine homes Fire would not be lit, except once every two months And if he wanted otherwise, he could have had this happen to him This is Zuhd Now, each one of us know what is best for him, and what is closer to Allah when he fixes his heart accordingly And synchronizes it accordingly Six of the ten heaven-bound of the companions were millionaires, and some of them were billionaires But this did not negatively impact their journey to Allah Azzawajal So we have to know how to balance, and Allah Azzawajal knows best And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one If you can afford it, that's good for you If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session And this is for everybody If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour So come to me, and let's speak about it inshallah, within the following two days or three days And bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah Al Fatiha"
