  "transcript": "to make a set to make a charity for a sick person is it mandatory to slaughter a sheep the answer is no you can offer any type of charity because sadaqa Ward's off calamities and tribulations with the grace of Allah so if you give sadaqa whenever you are afflicted by a tribulation an illness a calamity then this would help insha'Allah in solving it it doesn't have to be slaughtering a sheep sometimes benefiting the poor with cash it might be better than giving him meat so he has phone bills to pay electricity bills medical bills so giving him cash is is better"
