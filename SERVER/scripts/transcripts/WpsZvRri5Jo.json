  "transcript": "Sidi from Germany, He says if a person listens \nto songs that contain kufur will he be a kafir?   The answer is 'no'. Kufr is a belief so if \nhe listens to it and does not believe what's   in it he's definitely committing a sinful act \nbut he doesn't leave the fold of Islam until   he believes in it. Now this may cause a \nproblem with verse 140 in chapter four   surat Nisa where Allah says azza wa jal that \nHe has revealed in the Quran that whenever you   hear that the verses of Allah is being mocked\nوَقَدْ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الْكِتَابِ أَنْ   إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ يُكْفَرُ \nبِهَا وَيُسْتَهْزَأُ بِهَا فَلَا تَقْعُدُوا   مَعَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُوا فِي حَدِيثٍ \nغَيْرِهِ ۚ إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا مِّثْلُهُمْ   ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ جَامِعُ الْمُنَافِقِينَ \nوَالْكَافِرِينَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ جَمِيعًا ‎﴿١٤٠﴾ and it's being disbelieved in that you should not \nsit with them until they speak about something   else otherwise you will be with them or among \nthem. So does this mean that they are kafir   for that? If they have the content and they \nrefuse to leave when they're able to leave   and they're content with that what they're saying \nof blasphemous things and mocking the verses of   Allah azza wa jal, then they are! This is not \nlike someone listening to a song that may have   a word or two about kufur and he's not \ncontent with it, if he's happy and content   not loving the song, content with the \nblasphemous content of that song he's happy,   he's content with the contents, with the shirk, \nwith the kufur and yes there's another god oh   this day said this that and he's happy with \nthat, this is Kufur and Allah knows best."
