  "transcript": "Sidi from Germany. Alayshu Maashit Ory. Khoobay Alhamdulillah. Ma Sha Allah. Akhi don't test me in languages, I'm very bad in this. I would like to be a polyglot but I'm testing you. Yes Sir. Sheikh, if someone doesn't take his time to read Quran, not even one page, instead he's watching videos, playing video games and so wasting his time. And even worse, he finds it boring to read the Quran, or even worse, that he doesn't like that the Quran is being recited in his presence. So are these signs of hypocrisy? The first one is not. The second and the third, yes. So, if someone doesn't recite the Quran, I wouldn't say he's a hypocrite if he's praying on time, if he's avoiding haram, if he is doing the basics, essentials of Islam. The moment he is downgraded, I wouldn't say elevated, he's downgraded to a level where he feels agitated when the Quran is recited next to him, when he doesn't have anything better to do. Yes, I understand, someone is studying and you come and blast the Quran next to him, he's agitated. Someone is trying to sleep and you do that. Someone is trying to engage in something and you're distracting him with blasting the Quran against his will. Yes, he has the right to be agitated, not because he hates the Quran, he hates your action and you are responsible for that. So, yes, a person who hates normally listening to Quran and would not love to hear it mentioned or recited or explained, this is a huge sign of hypocrisy. May Allah protect us and Allah knows best."
