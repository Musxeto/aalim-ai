  "transcript": "good evening sir my name is Robin Antony I'm a student of architecture I would like to ask you in the Bible during the Last Supper Jesus Christ took the bread and the cup of wine he gave thanks and said take this all of you and drink from it this is my body which will given up for you do this in memory of me why do why did you say that the question P this that doing a Last Supper he gave bread and he told them to drink why did he say it when he gave the bread if you're talking about Gospel of Luke chapter number 24 verse number 36 when he goes in the upper room and he meets the 12 apostles he goes and he tells and wishes them shalam alayum may peace be on you and the apostles are shocked that how could they see Jesus Christ PE be upon him and he says you handled me and see for a spirit has no Flesh and Bones he says take and see my hand handle me and see for a spirit has no flesh and Bone because at that time his disciples had thought that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was dead so when Jesus peace be upon Him comes in front of the Apostles and he says you handle my hand and feet and see a spirit has no Flesh and Bones because they think that he died and now he's coming come back in spirit form so he's telling them that I'm not a spirit I'm a human being yet then he say do you have any broiled fish and honeycomb do you have something to eat they say yes so he took the bread and honeycomb and he ate he ate to prove to them that he was not a spirit but he was a human being to prove to them that he did not die on the cross he was alive he took bread broiled fish and honeycomb to prove it to them that he was not a spirit but he was a human being and this matches with what I said earlier that Jesus Christ peace be upon him did not die but he was alive hope the anwers the question brother yes please brother do you believe that there's one God yes please do you believe Jesus Is God no do you believe Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is Messenger of God yes mashallah if you believe that there is one God and you believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God that means you're a Muslim would you like to say it in Arabic yes please is anyone forcing you to become a Muslim no are you doing out of your own free will yes please is anyone paying you money no I say it in Arabic and you can repeat it okay ashuu Allahu muhamad muhammadd I bear witness I bear Witness that that there is none worthy of worship there is none worthy of worship except Allah except Allah and I bear witness and I bear witness that that Prophet Muhammad prophet Muhammad is the messenger is the messenger and servant of Allah and servant of Allah become a Muslim and I pray to Allah subh Grant you jna and may give you the best in this world and the I would like to give you a translation of the Quran you're most welcome to come on the stage brother"
