  "title": "Which Islamic Banks Are Truly Islamic If it's a well known Islamic Bank, can we take its profit",
  "transcript": "The next question is from Sister Amina. As a layman, I do not know which Islamic banks are truly Islamic. If it's a well-known Islamic bank, can we take its profit? Wow, this is a complicated issue because there is a famous video clip of mine which talks about Islamic banks. Are they real or just a tag name? And in a nutshell, if a bank comes to me and says, I'm an Islamic bank, I don't have the knowledge to go into the processes and to see how they act and deal on day-to-day basis. So the only way to do, to verify this, is to ask the people in the country, the scholars of the country, and to check their Sharia board. Islamic banks are divided into two types. One that has a real Sharia board that governs every single transaction, that has spot checks throughout the year. Every few weeks they go and spot check a branch and look into their transactions. Why did you do this? Why didn't we say that this is haram? You should not sell except what you possess, et cetera. Other Islamic banks have a Sharia board, but they are in a way an honorary Sharia board, meaning that they just convene or meet once every few months, like six months or four months a year. And they show them a few projects and they look into it and they say yes or no. But whether these projects are implemented as per the advice of the Sharia board or not, this is not their business. So there's no audit that looks into them to make sure whether it's being Islamically true or not. And the vast majority of Islamic banks are like the latter. So the Sharia board, like myself, I just sign and I go. Whether my fatwa is being implemented or not, I don't care. I'm being paid at the end of the month or the year. And who makes sure that this is implemented or not on a day-to-day basis? Nobody. Such banks are dubious, you should not be with, and Allah knows best."
