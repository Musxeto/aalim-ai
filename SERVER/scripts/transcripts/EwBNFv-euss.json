  "transcript": "from saudi arabia uh so i have a big question actually there is a problem in the house okay in india there's a problem going on in the house some uh bad things are happening like evil things in the house they are not letting the family stay in the house some like that so what shall we do i don't know i do not know the unseen so when you talk ambiguously like this it might be there are crooks breaking into the house there might be mice and reptiles eating the people there might be gin there i don't know what you're referring to so jin and snakes like in one room when the family members are going during uh like after us time sunset time they are [Music] telling do not enter this room this is al and when nobody is in the room everything like from the uh cupboard the clothes are thrown away and and even though family members who are living over there they are reacting in different way and you know they are saying do not enter this room and just leave the house okay so one of the two either you guys are hallucinating and you are convinced that the house is possessed and your hallucination is making you hear these things and whenever one says to the other did you hear that and they said yeah yeah we heard that and you start to believe this lie or no the actually the house is possessed so if the house is possessed what to do the jinn cannot harm us and when we fear them they become stronger and they grow more influential so what to do should we call the ghostbusters there is no such thing read surat al-baqarah in the house it burns them read repeatedly the last two verses of surat al-baqarah specifically the last two verses of the surah al-baqarah the prophet says it prevents the jinn from entering your hearts for three days and nights read repeatedly ayatul kursi and blow around the house and this burns them alive and continue to do this repeatedly full conviction that allah is their lord allah is stronger than them and allah will make them go out if this does not improve and fix rapidly you can do this rukia on water and you can sprinkle it around the corners of the house and at the entrances of the house and do that repeatedly until the house is clean but never fear them if i'm in my house and this happened few times i hear the doors banging and the lights turned off and i say and i speak i say turn it off turn and on i'm not going to be afraid of you and i read the ayatel kursi loudly in the last two verses of surah al-baqarah it doesn't happen again so be strong depend on allah azzaw and never fear them and nothing would happen in sha allah you"
