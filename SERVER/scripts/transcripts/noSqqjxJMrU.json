  "title": "Are Basketball Team Captain Responsibilities Permissible in Islam? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh Haroon from Bosnia I'll make a brief check recently I've been giving the task as a coordinator from a high school basketball team uh basically like a team captain and I have the task to round up and collect players who play for the basketball team that means I also have to organize the team practices and such so I was wondering is this permissible for me to do if there is nothing Haram involved and they're all of the same gender all boys and they're just playing basketball for for the school there is no fee for participation in games or the likes there is no problem in that insha Allah playing sports is a good thing to do it's a healthy thing when a person does it without engaging in Haram and basketball is not a actual physical sport it's a good game it it increases your endurance and your stamina and it's fun to play so I don't think I don't see anything uh bad in that inshallah thank you"
