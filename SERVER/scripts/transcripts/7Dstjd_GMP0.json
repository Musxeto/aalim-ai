  "transcript": "from the emirates uh my question is um if there is a fear of menses for a woman who goes on hajj on the 13th day and they are going to stay till like 20 25 today is it fine to do towards the 13th itself okay i will answer your asset the issue of hajj is a very simple yet a bit complicated for those who do not read and learn about it and unfortunately for most of us who performed it once every blue moon therefore you have to revisit this in hajj there are pillars which if you avoid them then your hajj is invalid among the pillars is a tawaf one tawaf where you go around the kaaba and it's called tawaful ifadha or another name tawafu ziyara or tawaful hajj three names for the same ritual different names but the same ritual and it's a pillar the timing of it is on the tenth of the hija on the day of eid and it can be delayed on the 11th 12th 13th up till the end of the hija without it you can not if you're married have intimacy with your spouse otherwise you will be obliged to slaughter a sheep because you've committed at one of the restrictions of hajj there are two types of tahalul the first one is the one that i can wear my normal clothes wear perfume clip my nails get married etc blah blah blah this is done when i throw the seven pills on the day of eight and i shave my head that's it boom i can do that everything is permitted for me as a pilgrim as a mukhrim except intimacy if i perform pawaful hajj and the saee of hajj which both are pillars then now i can have intimacy with my spouse if you did this on the 10th of the hija on the day of eight so you've accomplished the pillars we come to a different type of tawaf known as the farewell and this is mandatory where the prophet said if this is the last thing you do before leaving mecca back home you have to offer seven rounds around the kaaba and this is called tawaful wada this particular tawaf is mandatory if you go home without doing it you have to slaughter a sheep in mecca and distribute the meat to the poor but there are people who are exempted from doing it who a woman in her menses so if a woman a woman already performed her pillar tawaf tawaf on the 10th or the 11th of the hija then she waited until the 13th or the 14th or the 15th and then wanted to go back home but she is in her menses we say to her go in the safety of allah azzawajal you are not obliged to perform it there is no expiation there is no sin on you so i hope this answers your question you"
