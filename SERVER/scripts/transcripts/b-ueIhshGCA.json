  "title": "Can a girl stay without a mahram?",
  "transcript": "the name is in tamil tamil i am sadjia my question is if a girl is not allowed to spend the night or stay in a place other than harm is it permissible for girls to stay away from her family in the residential halls of various educational institutions and universities first of all no one said that it is not permissible for a girl to stay in a place without the company of her male mahrab this is baseless my daughter can go and spend the night in her cousin's uh house her female cousin's house in the presence of her aunt maternal aunt and her husband and maybe their sons as long as it's segregated and she doesn't mix with them and they don't see it her non-mushrooms don't see her there's no problem that girls can get together and spend the night in a friend's house no problem with that staying in campuses or dorms in universities again if this is totally segregated there's no possibility of males coming in and it is safe for her there is nothing wrong in that insha allah"
