  "title": "Can a Pregnant or a Breastfeeding Women Feed instead of Fasting? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I read that it is permissible for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers not to fast and that they could feed the poor and do not have to make up their Miss days how true is that as far as for a lady who's pregnant or who's breastfeeding how should she make up for a fast the views are divided the there are two groups of Scholars one group of Scholars they say that she need not make up for the fast only thing she has to give is the feeding of one poor person for every fast she has missed based on the ver of the Quran of Surah bakar chap 2 verse number 184 that if you find it difficult to fast then feed one indent person and according to the ofn Abbas it's mentioned in Sunan Abu daud volume number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2311 abas pleas with him he gives commentary of this verse of Bak 2 vers 184 he says this is meant for people who are very old old man or old woman or people who are continuously sick and there's no chance of them to become healthy and he also adds that this refers to breastfeeding mothers and pregnant women but according to albani this Hadith is it's a weak Hadith but there is another Hadith which is there in whereas with him he says to concubine that because you're pregnant you need not keep the fast again you only have to give fidya that is feed one poor person of every fast you have missed talking to a concubine who had Miss fast so based on this this group of Scholars say that you need not make up for the fast only give fidya feed one indent poor person for every F have missed but the other group of Scholars what they say that this verse of the Quran Surah bakar 2 vers 184 does not fall in the category of breastfeeding women and pregnant women rather the next verse Surah Bak chapter 2 verse number 185 which says that fast in the month of Ramadan but if any of you is sick or on a journey then you should make up the fast later on so what this group of Scholars say which is also the call of Ali pleas with him that a best feeding woman and a pregnant woman fall in this category they fall in the category of a person who's sick you know it may be if she fast it may be dangerous for her life or if she fast it may be dangerous for the life of the baby so they say the breastfeeding women and the pregnant women are more closer to the people who are sick therefore they have to make up the fast because the words of Sur Bak CH 2 ver 185 says that fast in the month of Ramadan but if if you're ill or if you're on a journey you have to make up for the fast later on from the other days so this is a more correct ruling however there's another third group of people what they say that if she has to fast because her life is in danger then she has to make up for the fast later on from the other days but if she has broken the fast because the life of the child is in danger then besid making up for the fast later on she also has to give FID she has to feed one poor person but the more authentic ruling is the second ruling that if a breastfeeding woman or a pregnant woman if she misses any fast or she breaks any fast only thing she has to do is make up for the fast later on this is more correct view as compared to all the view live which is also followed by Imam Ahmed IM Ahmed hbal when Abu da Allah have mercy on them asked Imam Ahmed hbal that what should a breastfeeding woman do or a pregnant woman do if she misses the fast so he replied that she need not feed anyone but she has to make up for the fast later on from the other days"
