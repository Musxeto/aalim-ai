  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah now that all cards are on the table and the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam held nothing back he told them bluntly all these Idols you're worshiping are false deities there's only one God to be worshiped he's the creator of the heavens and the Earth he's the one who showers his mercy and blessing ings over you he's the one who provides he's the one who facilitates he's the one who gives life and death so you have no choice but to worship him and I am his prophet and messenger I am the servant of Allah the almighty remember Mecca the tribe of qur and all those who came along with it they were hostile people violent people they had no words to express their feelings and the fastest way of doing this is their swords so what would you expect the whole of the community which was led by arrogant men Fierce enemies of Islam such as Abu laab such as Abu sufyan such as and the likes what would you expect them to do the whole of the tribe of qur followed these notorious enemies of Islam so they reacted in a hostile way they started brutally torturing and abusing Muslims in their families and their tribes and those of the other families and tribes wherever and whenever it was possible possible they would explode in their faces and deal with them in a very harsh way and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was not an exception he too was abused physically and verbally by them narrated by Abdullah Mas may Allah be pleased with him and the Hadith is in and Muslim when the prophet was once praying in the courtyard of the Kaa these mushriks these Idol worshippers told one another who among you would go to the house of so and so and bring the placenta of this she camel that just gave birth so someone of them went and brought it all this filth and disgusting material that comes out when a baby she camel is born and he took that when the prophet was prostrating and placed it on his head and back and they started laughing from what they see the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam did not even raise his head he kept on prostrating until someone notified Fatima and she came running as a child and removed it from his back only then the prophet Sall wasallam raised his head concluded his prayer and then raised his hands and made Dua oh Allah punish qu oh Allah punish quray oh Allah punish quray they were petrified by the Dua of the Prophet wasam yet they did not stop they continued to harm his companions and to face and encounter such aggression the prophet Alam took two wise steps and and this had a huge impact and a positive impact to uh the Islam and to the Muslims what did the prophet do the first step was that he chose a place for his companions to convene and to join in so that it would be the center of dawa and the call and this place was the house ofam and they used to convene there recite the Quran learn their religion and strengthen one another away from the eyesight of the disbelievers and this would help them organize their activities and their works the Second Step was to allow the companions to migrate and when life was really tough the prophet Alat wasam told the companions that in ABIA in the land of Ethiopia there is a king in whose realm no one is mistreated and this shows you that the prophet sallallahu alai wasam had insight and used to ask and know the environment around him so he knew that there was a fair and just King in Ethiopia so he told his companions to go to his land until Allah makes a way out for you so the Muslims left to Ethiopia and they were honored by the King by anashi may Allah be pleased with him and among the first to go were may Allah be pleased with him who is the third khif and who was married to R the daughter of the Prophet Alat who went with him along side a number of the companions senior Companions and this was the first migration that took place approximately 5 years after the prophet's Mission had started am and they say that they were about 11 men and four women this was the first migration this first migration was for few months until they heard false rumors that the people of qur have accepted Islam and now everybody's practicing Islam without any form of Oppression so they went back but unfortunately when they went back they found it even worse than when they had left so they went again to abisinia for the second migration but this time they were about 82 men and 12 women alongside with their children so a big chunk of the Muslims have migrated this did not go down well with the people of quray when they saw that a huge number of their people have been relocated to established to establish a new religion so they did not leave leave them alone and this shows you their mindset their evil mindset people who came up with a new religion something that you don't like the worst that could happen is they leave and they worship and preach their own religion somewhere else leave them be you have nothing to do with them no the people of qur do not want this to happen and they would not it would not go down well down their throats so what they did was they sent two of their men trying to pursue the king of Ethiopia to send these Renegades back to their people they sent and ABD after them so that they would convinced the ruler of Ethiopia through their gifts and wealth that they sent with these two Messengers to distribute upon his men priests rulers Etc to convince the king but to no avail because the king of Ethiopia of the abini and Nashi accepted Islam and he told them and sending sending them back with their gifts that these people would are free to worship Allah on my land for as long as they wish and they went back to qur empty-handed and defeated through this hard times there would always be a breeze of fresh air and this is part of Allah's Mercy whenever it's get tough the tough gets going whenever the going gets tough the tough gets going Allah asael always sends us things to relax Us in times of distress and Calamity through these times two great men accepted Islam mentioning their names throws the fear in the hearts of the men of qur these two great warriors were Hamza the uncle of the Prophet ham and and he was the second khif in Islam and the second best man in Islam after Abu Bakr here qur knew that they cannot continue to torture and torment the people with such strong backup manifested in Hamza and in Omar so they thought that it might be best to start to negotiate with the prophet [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
