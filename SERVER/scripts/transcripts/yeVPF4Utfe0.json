  "transcript": "Mert from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh my question is related to speaking ambiguously at business. So Sheikh, when I'm getting a call or like a like a client, potential client, I may speak a little bit ambiguously so what I said or what I say could be interpreted differently. So my Sheikh, my question is like is it permissible to speak ambiguously while not lying but could be understood differently? The Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, said in an authentic hadith, Al-bay'aani bil khiyari ma lam yatafarraqaa. Those who buy and sell, they have the choice to continue or cancel the transaction unless they separate physically from one another and leave the room. Then the Prophet said, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, fa in sadaqa wa bayyana boorika lahumma fi bay'ihma. If they say the truth and clarify. Not only say the truth because ambiguity can be truthful but you have double meaning so you did not clarify. So the Prophet says you have to say the truth and clarify what's the result. Allah will put barakah and blessings in your transaction. Otherwise Allah will take the blessings away. So when you're talking to sell something or to market it, it is unethical, un-Islamic to be ambiguous while knowing that he understood something else than what you wanted to say. Because this is actual cheating."
