  "title": "Can a pregnant woman pray sitting down? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now his second question was about a pregnant woman in her third or fourth month of pregnancy can she pray sitting down the answer is sitting down or standing up is not related to how many months you're pregnant in standing up for prayer of fault prayer is a pillar which means that if you fail to do this while you're able to do it your prayer is invalid so standing up while Abel is a pillar of follow the prayer the Prophet said as some suddenly are a man as in the hadith of Imran Hosein you have to now if a person is sick injured too tired to stand up he has a legitimate excuse not to stand up so even if she's one month or two months pregnant but she's unable to stand up she can't in this case there is no problem in sitting down and praying but if she's able to stand yet it's difficult to prostrate then she has to stand up do rock or do refer from rock or sit down for suit she doesn't have to perform the prostration as normal because she's too heavy or too tired or it's too painful as for the voluntary prayers even if you're well you can pray sitting down so it doesn't matter whether you're sick or not voluntary prayers can be performed while sitting down because the Prophet said erase all of them the prayer of an individual sitting down is half the prayer of an individual praying standing up so I hope this answers your question"
