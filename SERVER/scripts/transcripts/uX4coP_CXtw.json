  "transcript": "like i've seen a question was he the false messiah okay i will answer inshallah from bangladesh says who is saf ibn sayed saf ibn sayyad was a young jewish boy living in medina and he was a soothsayer he had jinn communicating with him and the prophet in the beginning allah was doubtful whether he is the dajjal or not and that was before the hadith of jeremiah where he came and told the prophet hassam about their encounter with the jail in an isolated island where he was chained and he asked him few questions so this was all before that and the prophet did not have knowledge about the jed so he had his doubts because it was circulating that this jew boy predicts few things of the future so he wanted to make sure so the prophet hassam went with i think omar and he was trying to listen to some of the things that this guy has and why he was approaching the place his mother saw him so the prophet assam and she said to her son the prophet is here muhammad is here so he took his guard so the prophet asked him few questions which he could not complete the answer of and the prophet recognized and realized allah that he was a mediator with the jinn he was worshiping jinn and they were giving him some info so he let him be pleased with him asked the prophet shouldn't i chop his head off the prophet said no no if he's the dajjal you won't have authority on him because there's a prophecy and if he's not killing him would not do you any good if i recall correctly also in sahel muslim abu sayyaf and everybody was avoiding him and among them was and he was you know feeling very bad about this guy until he approached him one day and he said to him i would say you're knowledgeable don't you see how people treat me they think i'm the antichrist they're the jail but i live in medina and i'm heading to mecca and the prophet said islam that the dajjal cannot enter mecca or medina i'm going for hajj the prophet said that he's one eyed i have two eyes blah blah blah so in summary this is who suffers was an alarm"
