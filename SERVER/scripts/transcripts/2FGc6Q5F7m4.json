  "title": "Can we rebuke a Daee or Scholar if they said something wrong publicly",
  "transcript": "from the us yeah uh my question is if a guy or any muslim with a platform that speaks about islam on the internet or elsewhere there's something that is clearly wrong that makes the ignorant people think that what he just said is halal are muslims allowed to publicly repeat them for the sake of warning people okay now the question is crystal clear any scholar any guy who made a mistake and said halal things to be haram or the opposite haram thinks to be hella and he has a public platform and everybody listens to him so are we allowed to correct his mistakes there is an approach to that if this public figure is well known to be sincere to be knowledgeable to be always on the right path and akida and methodology and manhattan yet he made a mistake or two welcome to the club we're all humans the first thing you should do is to contact him privately or contact those who know him to give him an advice you said on that particular day so and so and so on this is wrong and the most authentic opinion is one two three four if he rectifies his mistake then alhamdulillah you've done your duty in front of allah you are the hidden soldier you are an anonymous person nobody knows about you except allah then you are on the right track but if this day or sheikh does not fix it does not rectify his mistake and his mistake is a real bomb it's a real mistake it's not something that it's an issue of dispute among scholars because if it is an issue of dispute among scholars no this is his opinion versus your opinion maybe your opinion is most authentic but this doesn't mean that i have to follow yours so it's an issue of dispute leave it alone no no i'm talking about something that is clearly out of the question and it's haram or a obvious thing to anyone and he does not rectify it there is no problem in going publicly and rectifying it but without tarnishing his reputation without calling him names without erasing all of the good things that he had done in his previous life we're not talking about an apostate we're not talking about a hypocrite who used to be a good righteous person and all of a sudden turned into a hypocrite changing and twisting the verses and the hadith and changing the akadah and accusing islam no no we're talking about someone who made a simple mistake so you praise him and this this scholar is a good caller to islam he did so many good things to islam and masha'allah we wish that he him to continue to succeed and progress and and and spread the word of islam but we all make mistakes and one of the mistakes that this prominent nari had done was this and the correction is one two three four that's it there's nothing wrong in that insha allahu azam we have you"
