And it leads to anxiety, stress, depression, and it's about kufr, shirk, and many other things. And I get stuck between this or not. Yes Afreen. Okay, you have to trust Allah Azza Wa Jal. If you have anxiety attacks, the only solution for that is to trust Allah Azza Wa Jal and to identify that these are caused by shaytan to mess up your head and confuse you and destroy your life. If you listen to them, he wins, you lose. And if you don't, then you will trust Allah Azza Wa Jal and you will be insha'Allah a normal person. If you want more advice of this, you need to book a counseling session with me if you can afford it. And if you cannot afford it, and the conditions are fulfilled in you, you're entitled for one free counseling session insha'Allah Azza Wa Jal."
