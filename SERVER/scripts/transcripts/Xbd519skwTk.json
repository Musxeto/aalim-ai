  "transcript": "Sam, Sam. Who's this? Sam, Sam from Canada. Yes Sam, what can I do for you? Just want to ask you, if somebody wakes up and they see, how do you differentiate between many and many? How do you know which is which? Like if you're doubtful on which one do you still do? Many, many has a specific features in it that when you wake up, first of all, it is in far larger quantities than mevi, which is prosthetic fluid. Mevi, it comes in few drops, one or two, maybe three, and it's light and it's not, it's water-based. So when it dries, it just leaves a white mark, but it has no mass to it. While many, it comes in a larger quantity. When it dries, it has a smell of rotten eggs, and it is like plastic. You can see that there is mass to it, and it's white. So there is huge difference between the two."
