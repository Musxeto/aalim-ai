  "transcript": "Arik from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. So Sheikh, today my question is, after every Fajr Salah, is it also a part of Sunnah to say 10 times Subhanallah, 10 times Alhamdulillah, 10 times Allahu Akbar and 10 times La Ilaha Illallah? Okay, the Sunnah is to say 10 times Subhanallah, 10 times Alhamdulillah, 10 times Allahu Akbar. I don't know of 10 times La Ilaha Illallah. These four phrases are to be said 100 times each, and this is known from Hadith Umhani' bint Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with her, where the Prophet said, say 100 times Subhanallah, 100 times Alhamdulillah, 100 times Allahu Akbar, 100 times La Ilaha Illallah. And this would be equivalent to offering a hundred camels full of goods for the sake of Allah, a hundred horses, it would fill between the heavens and the earth, it would fill the scales on the Day of Judgment, etc. But after, and this is said openly during the day and night, and you can repeat this a hundred, a thousand times, up to you, but to say the Adhkar after Salat, we say Subhanallah 33, Alhamdulillah 33, Allahu Akbar 33, and La Ilaha Illallah once, or we say Subhanallah 33, Alhamdulillah 33, Allahu Akbar 34, or we say Subhanallah 10, Alhamdulillah 10, Allahu Akbar 10, or there is another Dhikr where we say it 25 times, but I don't know any of saying 10, 10, 10, 10, and Allah knows best."
