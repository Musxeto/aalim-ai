  "title": "Party or reciting Quran after Widow's Iddah? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Suat from the UK Sheikh in my country on the last day of Eidar for a widow, the family or the children will sacrifice cows, kill, cook a lot of meal, share to visitors and neighbors and Imams and Sheikh who come recite the Quran, is this allowed and can someone attend such a celebration or an event? In order for us to know whether this is allowed or not, we have to go back in time to the time of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam and look at the end of the Eid of a widow, the four months and ten days. When it ended, did she throw a party like that? Did Imam come and recite the Quran? Were sacrifices offered? Did they feed the people? And the answer is no. This did not take place and therefore we know that such practices are part of innovations, especially that involves forms of worship such as sacrifice and reciting the Quran and inviting these so-called Shuyukh to read it. If a woman comes out of her Eidah period and she feels after being in a room or in her house confined for four months and ten days that she wants to celebrate, of course she finished the mourning period of four months and ten days which is mandated by Allah, but she wants to celebrate so she throws a gathering or a party to invite her friends and relatives to join her whom she would not see or would not visit during the past four months and ten days. There is no problem in that because this is part of the customs, but to relate forms of Ibadah to it, that would be an innovation."
