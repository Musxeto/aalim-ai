  "transcript": "Hamid from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, can you explain the hadith of Ibn Abbas without being given it? JazakAllahu Khair. I don't know any hadith that surah in the whole Quran. There is no doubt in that. The hadith is sahih. And Surah Baqarah as well as Surah Ali Imran, Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, are both will come on the Day of Judgment as clouds, clouding or shading the person who memorizes them. And taking Surah Baqarah is a form of blessing that the sorcerers cannot bear and the devils cannot tolerate, etc. But the specific hadith you mentioned, I don't know it personally, and Allah knows best. JazakAllahu Khair."
