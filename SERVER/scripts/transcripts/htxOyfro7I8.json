  "title": "Dua to Dead: Not Shirk? {The Basics 5}",
  "transcript": "they've diluted the concept of tahit even shirk nowadays is not shirk anymore so you yeah you can invoke the dead you can make dua to the dead this is not shirk it's something easy subhan allah this is not what the salaf used to teach this is not what the religion of prophet muhammad alaihis is this is not what the quran and the sunnah state so be careful the basics in our religion is to hate without it there is no islam if you nullified the heat it's like your wudu when you break it by answering the call of nature you cannot pray it's nullified"
