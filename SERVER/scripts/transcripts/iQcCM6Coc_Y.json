  "transcript": "in a particular episode of that series we talked about the Incarnation so but the episode before that particular episode does not talk about it and the episode after I did not talk about it so is it allowed for me to watch the episode before with an episode after it without watching that one what is it about that there's a particular episode that talks about The Reincarnation no no the whole series what is it about well about listening ninja ninja about all these are ninja stuffs so you're talking about anime exactly something about that okay we've talked about watching animes anime is something that is addictive it makes you addicted to watching it and you watch one episode you watch season one you watch season 150 and it's the same trash the same events the hero in the beginning has a tough upbringing and then his life goes on and then he finds challenges and he becomes stronger and you start supporting him and backing him up and then he may fall in love and may get his heart broken a number of tragedies happen down the way he almost gets killed and he comes back and he wins the same old crap excuse my French and it's making youngsters addicted to it now the problem is that it is part of the steps of shaytan so maybe the thing that you're watching doesn't have nudity yet or music or extreme violence or worshiping other than Allah you've mentioned that in one of the episodes they have Incarnation I'm certain that in each and every episode there is something related to their uh Haram kafir religion because this is their bread and butter This Is How They spread their ideology you may not notice it you may be blinded by your love to anime that you may not see it but it's slowly creeping into your veins to your system to your head to your heart and it corrupts the heart without any doubt it's not something that's Halal to watch and yeah it's fun we had fun watching it no it influences your Iman negatively without you feeling it because it steps it doesn't come all of a sudden it comes gradually so I would say that actually watching these series is not halal unless it is something that is like of 10 minutes 15 minutes a week maybe maybe twice a week and it's random but the way I've seen youngsters addicted to it and it's in their system and they buy certain cloaks they have certain posters they have them on their mobile phones you can see how it's impacting their life this is not definitely befitting a Muslim and Allah Knows Best foreign"
