  "title": "Who will be my spouse in Jannah? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Pervis says if both husband and wife enter in hell but after purifying from sins they enter paradise not together like wife enter first then husband enter after many years so in that case both will be husband and wife in paradise as well or men will only get the whole reign and wife another believing man in Jannah they won't be husband and wife for each other or anyhow the question is obvious the rule is if a couple a Muslim couple die they will be admitted to Jannah and they will be a husband and wife in Jannah as well of course there would be total transformation to the best of men and to the best of women and they would live in total infinite happiness till eternity there is no ending to that however we know that Muslims who are sinful by default they have to be admitted to hell to be purified from their sins so the issue is maybe one would be out of hell and admitted to paradise before the other one so because they went to hell now when they are admitted to Jenna will will they still be a couple man and wife or Allah would substitute each one of them with something that is different and better no the answer would be as long as they both enter Jannah they will still be man and wife now what would be the case when one is admitted a day a week a month or a year before his or her partner this is an Allah's knowledge don't go to details people waste time when they go into details and sometimes it is illogical a brother once asked me a couple of days ago well will there be night clubs and partying in in Paradise okay we're not told we are told that you will drink wine that has no hangover that has no headaches that is so sweet and you will enjoy that but definitely there won't be any bad things in general like in in on earth so one says oh can we have homosexuality in Jannah definitely not can we have an orgy etc all of these filth cannot be imagined in Jenna Jenna is so purified and not only that it is the promise of allah azza wajal that once you're admitted to Jenna there will be things that no I had seen no ear had heard of and no heart had ever imagined so it's total blessing and blessing and enjoyment of allah azza wajal to us we cannot imagine it so don't go into details just have full trust in Allah subhana WA Ta'ala"
