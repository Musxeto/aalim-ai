  "transcript": "Amina from France Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So, I will explain to you the context. So, I'm in love, I have been in love with the guy from Morocco for approximately 6 years. And he's living in the countryside and I'm living in France. So, now I'm earning, Alhamdulillah. And so, I was wondering if it's permissible if I ask his parents, if my dad asks his parents for marriage. And then you will change. I don't understand your question. What is the relationship between you earning and your dad asking his parents for permission? You want to change shoes and you become the groom and he becomes a bride? I don't understand. Yeah, okay. Listen, listen to me daughter. Amina, 6 years is a lot of time. And if he's not man enough to work, to earn, to gain the trust of your father and to propose to your father, he's not a man. I'm sorry to be blunt, but this is what I do for a living. Counseling sessions, people come to me because they want to hear the truth, not to be sugar-coated and not to be pampered. 6 years in a relationship, Allah is angry with you. Allah is not pleased with what you're doing. Because you are communicating, you're engaging, Allah knows in what. I would not go into details. But Allah is not pleased with you. After all these 6 years, he's not earning. And you're the one who's working and mixing with haram men and doing whatever you're doing. I'm not going into details. Still, you want to propose to his parents, which they may accept and they may reject you and humiliate you. And when you get married, he sits home playing with his PlayStation 4. While you work and pay the bills and the rent and the food. This is not natural. Unless you have a patch on your eye and a hook hand and a wooden leg. And your name is Black Beard the Pirate. Why would you wait for such a guy who's not a real man? Give me a break. He's not the last man on earth. So have dignity. Have karama. And have Islam. And look for what benefits you and gets you closer to Allah. May Allah make things easy. www.mooji.org"
