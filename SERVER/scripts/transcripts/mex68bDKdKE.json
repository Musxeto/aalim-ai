  "title": "Should I settle for a suitor who is less practicing than me | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says regarding marrying a person who is not as committed as we are what if what what if none of the shooters are as practicing as my family I told my family that Allah answers prayers and a practicing shooter will come eventually they are worried about my age as options seem to be limited some shooters accept the veil but say have to go out in front of the in-laws better to pray and wait or what do you advise first of all everything has been predestined by allah azza wajal fifty thousand years before he created the universe so it's done and life as we know it is just a test we're being tested as we speak some of us are tested with poverty illnesses health wealth all of these are different tests that allows that well gives to people and they will be held accountable according to their results and how they perform so technically if a woman accepts someone a suitor and she accepts his proposal though he is way below her level of righteousness and practicing the marriage is valid it is correct there's no doubt in that because he's a Muslim however is it advisable or not this is something that the vast majority of scholars would advise against why they say that women by nature are weak and not only women even men but generous this is more predominant in women they are weak vulnerable and easy to manipulate through a husband who is not as practicing inevitably and eventually she most likely will give in and her level of Eman would go down until it reaches or even surpasses the level of her husband a woman that does not watch movies TV series does not listen to music and whenever her husband is in the living room he's watching it so she stays in her room or in the kitchen after some time she will feel weak she wants to sit with her husband whom she loves or with her children but now she is stuck between a rock and a hard place if Allah does not make her steadfast usually the vast majority will fall weak and this is why as a woman you have to have preference you must have something that you would not agree to go below so let's assume the shooter is good in his moral conduct his luck is very high he's kind caring loving he has a good job but he is clean shaven this is sinful but does it impact your marriage to him I personally would not see that to impact it insha'Allah in the future you may be able to convince him it doesn't affect your marriage but when it comes to the veil if you're on a hobby and your husband is okay with it if you're out on the street but when it comes to his cousin's his brothers he tells you and orders you to take it off this does affect your religion and your Eman so again here you have to weigh the pros and cons what is best to compromise to accept or to just keep on rejecting and make dua you have to look into each case by case scenario if there is a potential suitor that has so many good things in him a good athlete he present the message let's say he has good al Qaeda he is a kind caring loving has a good job his family is fine but he doesn't pray in the machine or he prays on off in the machine in home he prays five times a day this is acceptable because with time inshallah you'll be able to convince him again this is something related to him practicing not to the marriage or to you or to your family so you have to weigh the pros and cons and see what suits you best at at the end of the day at the end of the day make a lot of draw and have trust in Allah Azza WA JAL"
