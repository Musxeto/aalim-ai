  "title": "Can I pray on a wheelchair? Assimalhakeem JAL ï¿¼",
  "transcript": "Ahmad from the US. Salam Alaikum. Salam Alaikum. Sheikh, so I use a wheelchair and it is a bit difficult for me to get on and off. Is it permissible for me to play on my wheelchair or do I have to sit on the floor? Okay, those who use a wheelchair use it due to a handicap and due to the fact that they're challenged. And this is a test from Allah. If they're unable to stand, they have the option to sit on the chair. Having said that, what will you do when you want to perform sujood? While on your wheelchair, you won't be able to do that unless you go down to the ground. And then in order for you to sit, you have to go back and find someone to help you to sit back on the chair. That would not be logical. So the logical thing for those like you who cannot stand but are able to sit on the floor is that when they join the congregation or when they pray on their own, that they sit on the floor. They commence their prayer sitting on the floor. When they do ruku, they do this, a little bit bending. And then they go to sujood on the ground, touching their forehead to the ground because they're able to do this. Now if you say I'm on a wheelchair but I cannot perform sujood on the ground for medical reasons, for reasons beyond my control, in this case, yes, you can pray on the chair and Allah Azzawajal knows best. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
