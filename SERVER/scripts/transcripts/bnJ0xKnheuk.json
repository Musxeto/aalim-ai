  "title": "Recitation of the Quran before Ceremonies and Meetings",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] says, I have a small doubt and hope \nyou can clarify at your earliest In Sha Allah.   I just want to know the practice of \nreciting a surah from the Quran before   starting a meeting or a Halaka, a circle, \nor any sort of gathering is Sunnah or is it an innovation? Did the Prophet ﷺ and his \ncompanions legitimize this? The answer is that   what is happening nowadays in all conferences, in \nall gatherings, in masjid lectures, in university,   graduation ceremonies, you have someone coming, \nreciting a Quran, a page or so, and then they   continue to do their function. This is a clear \ninnovation. The Prophet ﷺ never had done this.   The imams of Islam had never done this in \nIslam. This is something that came like   maybe less than 100 years ago. For that it was \nnever present. However, if this is done randomly   or if it is used to something that is beneficial, \nmeaning that I have a lecture on Hajj.   And they inaugurate my lecture \nwith a recitation on Hajj.   The guy recites verses of Hajj, I comment on this, \ngive interpretation, tafsir, and I go into my   lecture. This is totally legit, but to have this \ndone every single time, this is an innovation."
