  "transcript": "[Music] so uh radha from saudi arabia she says that a sister of hers died and there is this con concept of and this is taken from movies mainly that they're watching over us your mom is going to be proud of what you're doing your father is guarding you etc all of this is nonsense and believing in it can be sort of shirk when you think that your father's soul is guarding you and protecting you this is ship only allah as for the concept of the dead knowing what is happening on earth it's an issue of dispute some scholars say yes but the most authentic opinion is definitely no why because it was the prophet himself who said that i'll be the first one to reach the pool where people come and drink from and there will come people from my followers to drink from it but the angels stop them and prevent them from doing so so i would cry and say oh my lord my ummah my followers my nation and i will be told you muhammad do not know what they had done after you and this is the punch line you do not know which means that the prophet assalam does not know what is happening at the moment on earth he's not watching what's happening on earth and by the way this is not only an authentic hadith this is a muttawater hadith this is the highest level of authenticity so the quran is mutawater and there are a handful of hadiths that are also mutawati that no one doubts about them and one of them is the hadith of the pool or so the prophet doesn't know and this refutes those who say that the prophet is hazer nazar and he controls the universe as he controls the palm of his hand etc all of this nonsense not true blatant lies but people are taught this in their messages in their institutions in their colleges and this is why they grow up on such corrupt akida so the dead don't know what's happening they do not see what is happening and hence such a feeling would be more negative than motivational and people are supposed to abide by the quran sunnah and do not accept such thoughts"
