  "transcript": "when if you want to say it anytime this is a general dua so i am about to do something or to say something or give a presentation i say to myself as a dua but to open every lecture by saying it whoa come on this is not from the sunnah you praise allah you offer salutation upon the prophet salaam and you go ahead with your lecture go ahead with your presentation but to every presentation i'm making i say rabbis this is becoming an innovation because it is related to a specific time or a place or an occasion but to say it all the time to say it when i'm about to answer a test for example it's between me and allah azza no problem this is dua to say it publicly all those listening to you would think that this is part of the sunnah so why did the imam on friday did not say it maybe he doesn't know the sunnah it's not a sunnah yeah but uh so he's doing it so and so is doing it yeah this doesn't mean anything and allah knows best you"
