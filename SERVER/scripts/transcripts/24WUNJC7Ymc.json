  "title": "Can I pray Sunnah after the fard? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mohammed had two questions the first one is that we know if you did not pray the Sunnah that is before Fajr prayer the two rakahs that you are entitled and allowed to pray it after the fetcher so through this can we cascade it to all the other prayers such as the if I missed my four raka before the fourth can I make them up after the fort with the two Rakas which is originally afterwards so I pray six - two - can I pray the two Rakas after Maghrib after the end of Asia and Eurasia two rakahs after midnight etc the scholars say that if there is a legitimate reason for skipping your voluntary prayer then this is permissible for you to make it up what do you mean I woke up five or seven minutes before a comma of Bajor I have two options either I make my Sunnah in my home and risk losing the first AK beer or maybe the first raka in the Masjid or I go and if I reach Masjid before the Akama I pray my Sunnah there if I not then I prayed afterwards so this is a legitimate reason but if a person deliberately without any reason misses it what do you mean by no reason I'm sitting at the office and then of the  is given I did not pray the Sunnah why do I have worked did I forget am I in a meeting no nothing I'm just lazy some scholars say you can make it up I am inclined to the fact that by deliberately delaying it and skipping it that you cannot make it up because it was prescribed at a certain time as for Margaret see the Sunnah of Margaret is found with Maghrib itself so after I finished the fault if I had a legitimate reason not to pray the sooner and I was trying to pray it before Asia is called for but I couldn't because I was so busy I was engaged I forgot then you can pray it after Asia but likewise if you are like our friend previously mentioned and you skipped it without any legitimate reason and now you want to make it up at the end of the day the answer is that I'm inclined that it is not permissible and Allah knows best"
