  "transcript": "Salam Alaikum. And the first caller is Salma from the UK. The saying Subhana Rabbi Al-A'la like with the elongation of the A, like A'la invalidate the prayer. No, it does not invalidate the prayer. The meaning is the same. You have to pay attention to a universal fact that Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity. And it's not a religion of hardship and difficulty. Whenever you have an OCD or whispers of shaitan or hardship while offering ibadah, this is from shaitan. You're not practicing Islam. So people come and ask questions, not once in a blue moon, but frequently. And these issues are so trivial that they become obsessed with it. So Subhana Rabbi Al-A'la, Subhana Rabbi Al-A'la. Prolonging it, shortening it, it's the same thing because the meaning doesn't change. And such changes would not impact your prayer insha'Allahu azza wa jal. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
