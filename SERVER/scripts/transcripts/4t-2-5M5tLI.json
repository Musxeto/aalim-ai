  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I live in a different city and my brother lives in a different one and the houses in which we live are both owned by our father. If I visit him for two months for his wedding ceremony and stay with him for two months, is my namaz qasr or should I pray the full namaz? So Misbah, when you travel to your brother's city and someone calls you in your own city, what will your family say? Would they say Misbah went to his other home or would they say he's traveling? I'm not sure because my father sometimes lives with my brother, sometimes lives with me. Now we are all at his house. You're not asking Misbah, you're not asking about your father, you're asking about yourself. You live in Peshawar. If you go to Lahore, when you are in Lahore, when people call your home in Peshawar, no one would say oh he went shopping or he's next door. They would say he traveled to Lahore. So you are a traveler, correct? Yes. In this case, yes, you are a traveler. You pray shortening your four rak'ah into two and you can combine as you have the concession as long as the label a traveler is sticking to you. Maybe after one or two weeks you say Alhamdulillah, I feel settled in my brother's house. I know the masjid. I know the timing. I don't feel like a traveler. I feel like someone who has settled and resided there. In this case Alhamdulillah. Now you complete your prayer and pray them on time."
