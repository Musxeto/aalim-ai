  "transcript": "Ummaimuna from Bangladesh My question is, can I be in an all-female study group on social media where the women have uncovered profile pictures, sometimes share haram and bagbite? If I don't engage in haram, is it okay? As long as this is a study group and you don't chit-chat and you don't go through their chit-chat or socializing and you don't post your picture and you limit it to your own benefits, In Sha Allah, there is nothing haram in that."
