  "title": "She saw her purity at school & made Tayyummum on the stairwell so no one would see her, is it valid?",
  "transcript": "Sumeyya from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So if a woman becomes pure at school and she has to uplift her major ritual impurity, and tayammum is the only way she finds, but then she takes tayammum on the stairways because if she goes outside, she doesn't want the students to look at her. So she performs tayammum on the stairways where people usually walk over. So is that tayammum valid? Tayammum is valid as long as it is earth and the ground. It's something above the ground. It is valid if it has dust on it, which it most likely does. But if a woman reaches or sees her sign of purity, it is mandatory upon her to take ghusl. And most schools have shower rooms, which means that she has to just take a full shower, a ghusl, and moves on. This is possible in most public schools to my knowledge. But if this is not possible and there is no way for her to go home, in this case, she has to perform tayammum. Or if she can, delay dhuhr and combine it to asr when she reaches home. So if she reaches home by asr time, in this case, yes, she waits until she reaches home, takes her ghusl, prays dhuhr, four rak'ahs, and asr, four rak'ahs combined, and Allah knows best.
