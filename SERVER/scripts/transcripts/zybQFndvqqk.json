  "transcript": "Yusuf from Ghana Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Allah bless you Yesterday I asked a question about a person joining Salat and you made it clear that if the first line is completely full, he can start a new line but I was concerned about where should he start the new line, from middle to right, from middle to left, or starting it from where? Okay Sheikh Yusuf, if you pay attention to what I said yesterday and if you go on to the recording, you would say that the first statement I said was he should start exactly behind the imam because I understood your question. Some folks when they enter the masjid they start from the very right of the line leaving the whole area to the middle and to the left empty and this is wrong and this is not right. The right position for you to start a line or a row is right behind the imam so that the row would spread evenly from the right and the left. It is not correct that number 20 on the right is better than number 5 on the left to the imam. No, number 5 is better than number 20. Not only that, number 5 on the left is better than number 6 or 7 because he's closer to the imam. So I hope you go back to the recording and you will find that I mentioned this yesterday's answer and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
