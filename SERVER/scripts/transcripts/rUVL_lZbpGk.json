  "transcript": "Brother Muhammad from Saudi Arabia Shiekh I \nhave a question you know I I'm an expert I'm   an Indian and I work here in Saudi Arabia and \nuh alhamdulillah I've been uh keeping the beard   you know which is kind of uh my wife likes me to \nhave a very big beer long beard and always writes   like you know grow it as long as possible and \nAlhamdulillah but uh I work in a corporate and I   go uh for a you know I visit a lot of customers \nno one cared anything but can I trim and if   keeping a long beard is is it mandatory um if \nif so why people here and tell you that they   all trim and they don't have all wrong Goods \nokay first of all as Muslims we do not take   a country or a people as a role model because they \nare fallible they make mistakes you can't come   and say why do the country of so and so smoke or \nhave nightclubs they're Muslims why do their women   don't cover who cares they're not messengers of \nAllah and this is why Allah has sent us the Quran   and the Sunnah of the Prophet (Peace and Blessing \nupon him) and the favorite three generations so   that we can judge things by and Implement in our \nlives now when it comes to the issue of the beard   there are two respected opinions one is \nthat we must leave the beard as it is   not trim it not shave it not do anything \nbut honor it by brushing it calming it   perfuming it maybe sometimes put some \ncreams on on it no problem in that the other opinion is that it's permissible to \ntake whatever exceeds a fist this is a fist so   you take from the bottom of your fist not from \nthe top as most of the people do no you take   whatever exceeds the bottom of your fist and this \nwas reported by Abdullah and others but the vast   majority of companions did not touch it or trim \nit the vast majority of Scholars say that has   to be kept according to the Hadith of the Prophet \n(Peace and Blessing upon him) where he instructed   us not to grow it some people put medication \nthat would enhance their beard growth and this   is not required Allah did not say to you grow \nit Allah said to you leave it honor it Let It Go all of these just to let your beard go \nso this is the most authentic opinion   now in some cases where a person's beard is \nreally long and it jeopardizes his safety   such as an employee in a factory where there are \nmachines and conveyor belts and it might be caught   in one of the machines or a person who's \ndriving in his beard comes and covers his face   or sometimes as we've seen I've seen this \nwith some brothers when he eats it's too   long that it comes within the food and he eats \nhis own hair might be funny but it's irritating   in this case I personally I'm inclined to say \nthat yes due to the hardship you can trim your   beard to a length that would make it possible \nfor you to live normally and Allah Knows Best"
