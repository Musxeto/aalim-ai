  "transcript": "This is the hadith of the Prophet ï·º who knows what's happening. And, fourthly, these calamities and tests are a chance to contemplate, to reflect, to revise our lives. We live our daily routines unchanged. And we keep on thinking that life is good, life is great. Now I have more money, I have more business, I have more success, I have more children, I have no problems. Look at everyone else, they are falling like flies and I am thriving. What is happening? You get a wake-up call, a slam on the face, a hit on the head from Allah Azza Wa Jal. Why? To get you back on track, to get you to Allah. So many of us were so negligent and ignorant. With a simple calamity, we all started doing tahajjud, we started to pray on time, we started making dua, reading Quran, asking Allah for forgiveness. Isn't this calamity better than a million dollars? Yes, indeed. This calamity made me come back to Allah, made me know Allah, made me reflect on my life and be appreciative of whatever Allah has given me. So it has woken me up from my sleep."
