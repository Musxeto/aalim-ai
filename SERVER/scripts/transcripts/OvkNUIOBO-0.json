  "transcript": "one of them is from zubayr and Zubov says nowadays parents are teaching their kids especially girl children to learn self-defense like MMA to protect themselves from the fitna what's the opinion in the light of Quran and Sunnah first of all MMA mixed martial arts and it is a new form of fighting routine and a set of skills that are developed through extensive training and sports in general our Hallett providing that there is nothing how long included in it for example girls learning such a routine or such a skill if the teacher is male this is haram because this is free mixing if the teacher is a female this is OK providing that they're wearing the proper attire so if they are wearing clothes like the judo uniform this is ok it's all female environment but if they're wearing shorts or tight skin skinny trousers or fittings this is not permissible ma may include includes grappling chokeholds hitting the face kicking and the main reason for such a sport is to inflict as much harm as possible to your opponent in Islam this is not permissible the most prominent feature would be hitting the face and you can see that when your opponent is on the ground you have his legs locked and you're on top of him and you start bashing his face until he faints or surrenders in Islam Islam is the governing power Sharia is the thing that rules our lives we can't go around it in Islam as in as mentioned in sahih al-bukhari the Prophet Allah saw some prohibited striking the face full-stop and he prohibited it when there is an exchange between two while fighting so to initiate it even if the other one is not fighting you is even worse and this is not something of dispute because this is the teaching of the Prophet as Salam even if you're fighting in the cause of Allah or in self-defense you must avoid striking the face it is totally prohibited now what we see in MMA or UFC or whatever kind of martial arts or boxing all of this is Haram Islamically some people make and earn money out of that this is Haram what do you want me to do this is what the Prophet said allosaurus herbs so if girls or boys they go to such classes and segregated and they train for self-defense while if there is a committee they do not strike the face it's and they do not intend to harm so whether it's jiu-jitsu Aikido take one dou kung fu karate whatever type of martial arts they're doing if they avoid hitting the face and intending to harm their opponent and then doing it for the nice and what for the reaction the reflection and that the quick response there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
