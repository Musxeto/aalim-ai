  "title": "Can we narrate a Hadith in our own words? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "his heart from india if a person does not remember who narrated and does not remember the word by word but knows what the hadith talks about is it okay for him to convey to other people in his own words are you referring to hadith or quran okay i will answer from india he says what's the ruling on narrating or reading a hadith by the meaning and not by the actual words it's an issue of dispute some scholars say that this is not permissible because in the hadith of may allah appears with him when he was taught by the prophet islam the dua to say before going to bed after making wudu and sleeping on your right side the prophet told him as some to say at the end i believe in the book you have revealed and in your prophet you had sent now prophet sent so barab repeated the whole dua but at the end he said i believe in the book that you have revealed and by the messenger you had sent because sent is more associated to messengers so the prophet corrected him and said to him no by the uh and in the prophet you had sent not the messenger which led some scholars to say ah we have to stop exactly at the specific word that was used in the hadith and we cannot mention it by the meaning but the vast majority of scholars say that it is permissible for someone who knows the meaning of the hadith truly so if i know the hadith truly and understand it and rephrase it or translate it into english that would be fine insha allah because i have knowledge and i'm conveying what was the intention of the prophet sallam sometimes and this was and i i told this so many times in america i was reading a hadith that was translated by one of the imams there and this is the best that the imam could do but this is wrong the hadith of the seven who are martyred other than those who die on the battlefield among them the word is can mean the one who is stabbed with a knife but also it means and this is what the hadith is referring to the one who dies with the plague so the gentleman translated it to the one who was stabbed imagine me reading this hadith not knowing any better someone comes to mug me with a knife and he says give me a walt or i'll stab you and kill you said no no go ahead stab me i'd like to die as a martyr this is not true well this is what he translated to so saying it with the meaning is permissible if you know the meaning"
