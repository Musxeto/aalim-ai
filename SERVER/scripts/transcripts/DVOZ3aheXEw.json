  "transcript": "you have layla from pakistan my customers have tweeted that okay if a person is already righteous and doing good deeds and when he listens to someone telling him about other good deeds and about islam and after listening at the person who is telling him about islam an emotion arises in this person who is listening to and what i'm talking the next thing already exists in this person like allah says try to increase their thoughts to each other in good deeds so um he has this thing so my question is uh will the person he listened to here what is the same for his predecessor said he listened to him if i understand your question laila you're asking me about someone giving dawah to a christian am i right yeah but this christian did not accept islam yet correct i can't listen to you did this christian accept islam no i'm talking about a person who is already righteous the person who is already righteous doing good things okay and when he listens to someone okay for example um one person was listening to you yes uh yeah and after listening to you um an emotion arises in this person okay and like he he tries to increase in goodness yes so will you write it the same for his fatigue of course why do you think i'm doing this program if i understand your question is whenever i give an advice whenever i give a reminder if the viewers or one of them is reacting to that positively and he may go and say the vicar i just repeated or pray the namaz or the prayers i've just instructed him to do or refrain from haram which i have warned him from would i rewarded most certainly yes and this is why allah says in the quran women allah there is no one better than those there is no one better in rhetoric than those who call others for allah and do righteous deeds and proclaim i am among the muslims there is no one better than them so if you do this to your family then you get the same reward if you share a lecture that's beneficial or a description of how to pray or a warning from a sin a link with others and you manage whether you know it or not succeed in making these people comply you will be automatically rewarded of course i will be rewarded because i've initiated that and my teachers will be rewarded because they taught me this and the prophet saws at the end of the day he's the highly the most highly rewarded person on earth because all goodness goes accredited to him so definitely there's nothing that beats giving da'wah and correcting people's akida and calling them to tawheed and to the quran and to the sunnah you"
