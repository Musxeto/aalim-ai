  "title": "Not recommended to send Salutations on the Prophet in Sujood",
  "transcript": "and from Uganda. You say that it is not recommended for us to send salutations upon the Prophet when we are in sujood. What of the period between adhan and prayers when it is raining and during the last moments of Friday? I did not say it is not recommended to offer salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ when in the state of sujood. I said it is not part of the sunnah. It is not part of the etiquettes of du'a while doing sujood like in normal times. I'm sitting home and I'd like to engage in du'a. So what are the etiquettes? The answer is to face the qiblah, raise my hands, praise Allah Azza Wa Jal by saying, and then offer salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ and after that ask whatever I want from Allah. Whether this is between adhan and iqamah at the last third of the night when it's raining, when I hear the sound of a rooster in the early mornings, all of these are times of answering your du'a that the Prophet instructed us ﷺ and recommended us to make du'a. So if you engage in du'a before that, it is highly recommended to do what I just mentioned. In sujood, it's not the case. You just engage in asking Allah directly and Allah knows best. However, if a person offers salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ, there's no issue in that at all insha'Allah."
