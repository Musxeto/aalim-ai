  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh, I know that it is not permissible to take non-Muslims as close friends. There is a Christian guy who lives in another country and he comes to my country twice a year. Whenever he comes to my country, he sends me a text message asking me if he is welcome to come to my house. I don't do this for Dawah purposes, but just to catch up with him. If I accept him in my house twice a year and I don't have any types of communications with him in the meantime, would I be considered as the one who takes Christians as close friends? The answer is no. There is no problem in entertaining him twice a year, casually, like any other person. This is not taking them as allies or close confidants, and there is no problem in that."
