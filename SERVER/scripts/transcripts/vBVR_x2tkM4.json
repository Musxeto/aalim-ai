  "transcript": "n man from the UK Alum Chef um I'm calling regarding my 9-year-old son alhamdulillah he prays but uh here in the UK when it's summertime therea becomes really late like a 1145 and is around 2:30 so I just wanted to know until when is he allowed to combine with even after he reaches the age of maturity cuz when sometime comes I allow him to to combine but until when am I allowed to keep doing this the people up north when the night is so short and the time between is and F is very minimal to the extent that if they pray F on time they may lose praying F on time or they would introduce a great deal of hardship that is unbearable in this case a Scholars say that alhamdulillah there is a concession there is ease in the Shar for them to pray at the time of with so they can combine so at 9:30 they can combine between and praying and afterwards doing and praying four and going straight to bed not sitting and uh socializing and having a good time until 12 12:00 and then go to bed I might as well pray on time so if this is the case and they'll go straight to bed so that they'll be able to wake up for fer they have the concession to do that there isn't any specific timings okay until it's 9:30 but if it's 9:25 no you have to pray on time no it all depends on the hardship and whether it's genuine and real or Faked and made up so in your case n 11:30 and 2:30 F this is real hardship and Allah Knows Best"
