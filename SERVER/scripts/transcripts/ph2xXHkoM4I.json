  "transcript": "and they who turn away from ill speech so i was wondering does the word ill speech only include the word speeches that are in vain or actions as well for example if i play a video game and it doesn't contain remembrance of allah would it also be considered ill speech el speech means anything that distracts you from allah sin so this includes generally speaking where people are gathered so if you go to a friend's reunion or you gather or hang out with the boys and they chit-chat and speak about things that are if not sinful they're not that permissible this is ill speech what the disbelievers talk about insulting our religion this is ill speech now if you're involved in actions that do not require speech but the actions are bad watching uh uh wrestling this is not ill speech but the action itself is ill so this is wasting time playing video games that include excessive violence or lies or wasting of time or false beliefs all of this is also part of it and the prohibition uh applies you"
