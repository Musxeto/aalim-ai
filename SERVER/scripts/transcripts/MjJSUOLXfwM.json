  "transcript": "sara was asking about the issue of compatibility to a potential suitor and she says if we do not communicate and get to know one another how would we know that we're compatible for one another and the answer is in Islam there isn't such a thing in Islam a man is entitled to meet the woman he's interested in getting married once but before that he has to do his due diligence as well as she so he has to check on the background of the girl he has to ask his mother and sisters to go and check on her to describe her to him whether she fits his requirements and the features he's looking for he checks her background in terms of her moral conduct her religious practice by asking friends relatives those who know her and then she on the other hand her father does the same goes and check checks on the band whether he prays in the Masjid or not whether he has a sound a lead his behavior does he in engages does he engage in fights so often or none is he generous is he stingy does he lie he checks with his friends with his colleagues were all around once there is some form of acceptance from both sides they set a date and then the man goes to the girl's house and there he sits with the girl and her guardian her father her brother and this is the initial interview where they look at each other she's not wearing the hijab he looks at her she's not wearing any makeup as well she looks at him they exchange questions for an hour maybe an hour or more just to see if there is any form of Attraction afterwards if he is okay with that and she's okay with that then they go on and they considered to be engaged they formally proposed they set a date for the marriage the wedding and voila we have touched down but to go and date as Sawa is implying and to get to know one another a lot of similar engagements maybe in half a dozen or more did not work out because the man probably didn't like what he saw and she didn't like what she saw because they were all trying to fake things up they are not that serious they're just dating having a good time and no strings attached in marriage is different 99.9% of marriages in Islam is conducted like I said I stayed in the very beginning and this is how I got married I hummed Allah and all those I know around me got married in the same fashion and they've lived a happy life that and hamdullah is still ongoing why is that because they trusted a large door gel and they followed the Quran and the Sunnah and the correct procedure and this is what it led to while on the other side you find a lot of marriages ending so quickly not lasting too long because it was not based on such trust and dependence on Allah Azza WA JAL and in wanting this to happen and take place she says that if she does not like how the shooter looks but she's attracted to him usually it's not the looks that makes it or breaks it maybe as she's describing he's a bit chubby he's a bit fat but maybe he has a handsome face that relaxing maybe he has a good job maybe he is a real man that one can trust and depend on maybe he is wealthy or coming from a good family so there are a number of factors it's not how handsome or how fit or his symmetric in his body is so if you are attracted to him and you think that he would be a good father to children and a good husband to you then yes this is totally permissible to go ahead with the marriage as for your third question which is could you ask him to lose weight and then decide this is a little bit humiliating this is a little bit too much as if there's only you on on earth that he is obliged to get married to you have to wake up Sara the demand is far less than that than the supply women are so many nowadays and men are less in number and good men are even lesser and practicing good men who would make good husbands are very few so you don't get maybe a second chance if you lose the first one putting such conditions and insisting that he get loses weight maybe he would have his own conditions about you and the way you look or the way you behave or your religious commitment that he would also put conditions that you memorize the Quran you you do this and that this is inappropriate this is a marriage this is not a business transaction that one should put such conditions to analyze OGL knows best"
