  "title": "Deeds Not Accepted if I'm Rude to My Parents? Hadith Authentic? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Shamsul from UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I've heard in a lecture that there is a hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ said that there are three people whose deeds will not be accepted and that one of them is the one who is rude to his parents. So I was wondering if this hadith is true? I don't know the hadith that you're referring to but there are a number of hadiths where the Prophet ﷺ says three, Allah does not talk to them and does not look at them and does not purify them and they have great torment on the Day of Judgment and he mentions three categories. In one of these a hadith, al-aqu liwalidayh, the one who is undutiful, disrespectful to his parents. In another hadith, the Prophet ﷺ says la yadkhulu aljannata aq, a person who is undutiful and disrespectful to his parents will not enter Jannah. The scholars look at these hadiths to indicate that these are major sins but not sins that nullify Islam. So we don't say that a person who does this is out of the fold of Islam and is in Hell for eternity, rather it is one of the major sins in Islam and a person is in great danger and I hope this answers your question. Al-Fatiha."
