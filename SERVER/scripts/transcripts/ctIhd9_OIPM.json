  "transcript": "how could a muslim do what cope with poverty cope with poverty okay i will answer inshallah first of all we have to understand that a universal fact we always reiterate and mention over and over again no one on earth is not being tested every single individual is being tested however the tests of allah azzawajal vary some are tested with wealth some are tested with poverty others are tested with health while others are tested with illness and diseases and weaknesses so each and every one of us is being tested and never think not even for a moment that those who are tested with wealth that they have everything easy going for them you don't know about their depression their worries their overthinking the money was it earned from halal 100 percent or 95 percent or maybe 10 percent and was it spent in halal or not so these people are being tested and unfortunately a lot of them fail the test among the wealthy ones so when you look at those who allah is testing them with poverty this is allah's test it is not something you choose before you were born no angel came to you and said excuse me would you like to be born in africa or in europe would you like to be black or white would you like to be short or tall would you like to be rich or poor nobody asks you this it is what allah pre-ordained and it took place so what to do be happy because allah does not choose accept what is best for you be content because if otherwise would have taken place maybe you would not have been a muslim or maybe you've been forced to do sins and this is why the prophet said in an authentic hadith the poor enter paradise 500 years before the wealthy the wealthy are blocked on the gates of jannah for 500 years not because they had done since but they're being questioned and being held accountable for their wealth where they gained it from and where they had spent it in knowing that these are the righteous ones there are many who have utilized their wealth in haram and gained it from haram those would most likely not end up entering hell rather entering paradise after 500 years rather being thrown in hell to be purified so how do we cope with poverty number one be content that this is allah's test number two by trying to be positive and not sit back and accept what's happening rather work hard try your level best to improve your a level of or status of living try to gain more in through halal earnings with the best of your ability while being happy and content with what allah has preordained upon you and allah azza knows best you"
