  "title": "Following people on Instagram Sinful? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Dima from Germany. So my question is on Instagram, if you follow people, their accounts is in your follow list. And if these people have pictures without hijab on their profile picture, and other people see this picture through looking through my following list, is this sin on me or on them? What is the ruling on following such people Dima? No it's not famous people, it's like friends or like people you know from school. If this is the case and they're not posting anything haram, see it doesn't matter who these people are, if they're posting haram pictures of themselves, whether they're anonymous or famous celebrities or school friends, if they're posting haram photos, it is totally prohibited for you to follow them, or even to check on their accounts. But if they post halal things and they have their photo or someone's else photo in their profile, there's no sin on you for that because it's their sin and you're not advertising it on your page, rather someone snoopy like myself has to go into your followers to check and look this is my sin and not yours and Allah Azzawajal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
