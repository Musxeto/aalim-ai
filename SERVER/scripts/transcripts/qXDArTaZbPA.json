  "transcript": "and say it from singapore so my question is that can a muslim who is serving the military combining their prayers jani zoho [Music] especially when when they do not have enough ample time to do so during their service okay i will answer you insha allah aid from singapore says can we combine due to the fact that we're working in the army this is too generic say it not everyone who works in the army can combine for example if you are guarding a post and you're the only one there and you cannot pray and leave your post in this case you're permitted to combine but if there is someone else with you then you have to pray on time he takes watch until you finish then you take watch and he prays until he finishes so here we can combine if there is a necessity but to combine openly just because you work for the army no this is not uh permissible at all you have to pray on time unless there is hardship unless there is a true islamic legitimate reason not because your uh ceo a commanding officer ordered you not to pray i don't obey him and if he insists who wants to work in an army where they told you when you they tell you not to pray what kind of an army is this i serve allah and this is my priority if it is an islamic country in an islamic army then there is no obedience to other than allah if it's not an islamic army then you shouldn't be there in the first place how would you fight with a cause with a flag that is a kafir flag and allah knows best"
