  "transcript": "hombre Yan says what is the ruling for a lady to work in a supermarket in a non-muslim country if she does not get involved in stocking alcohol or pork she needs the job as a necessity if there's a supermarket that sells pork and alcohol and you work in a department that has nothing to do with such Haram activities your job is hella so if you work in the vegetables section or if you work in the detergents section you don't stock you don't carry you don't pay or receive money for such harm items then there is nothing wrong in working there insha Allah"
