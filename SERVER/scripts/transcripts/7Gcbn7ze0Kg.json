  "title": "Do Muslims have to stand up for the funeral of Non-Muslims? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka. Question, my question is do we have to stand up if we are passing by a funeral, like even if it's a kafir's funeral where we have to respect it, that we stand up while we are seated while driving or something and just quickly sit down? Is there any hadith relating to this? There is a hadith and the Prophet ï·º stood up for a funeral of a Jew and when the companion said this is a funeral of a Jew, he said isn't it a soul? Some say that this is not an authentic hadith and the most authentic opinion is that the instruction and the recommendation of standing up when a funeral passes by was abrogated. So now we don't have to stand up whenever we see a funeral being brought into the masjid or we are in our car and we see them pass in front of us, we don't have to do that because it was abrogated and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
