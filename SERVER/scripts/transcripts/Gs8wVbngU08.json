  "transcript": "Mohsin from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh What is the best way to make up for missed good deeds? For example, if I miss Fajr in congregation, can I post a video on a platform like TikTok or Instagram about the virtues of Fajr in congregation to gain back the missed reward or the missed deeds? Yeah, so the same with the sins, like if I do a sin, can I post a video notifying people that this sin like hardens your heart and stuff, just to make up, a form of making up. Barak Allahu Fikum, May Allah accept your good deeds and multiply them. I mean, first of all, Mohsin, this is something that no one can answer you. Measuring the compensation of a missed Fard or a sin that you have fallen into and compensating it with X, Y, Z, would it suffice or not? This is only known to Allah Azza wa Jal. Allah Azza wa Jal says in the Qur'an to follow sins with good deeds, for good deeds erase the bad deeds. How to quantify it and whether it would suffice or not, this is only in Allah's hands. You do as many good deeds as you wish and can and the rest is with Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala."
