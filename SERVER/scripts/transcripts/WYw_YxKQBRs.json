  "transcript": "RMA from the UK um sir during Ramadan uh in my local Masid they pray with like M uh but there's another mid 30 minutes away that doesn't should I go to the one further away it is best for you to go to the Masjid that follows the Sun and it's higher for your reward providing there is no hardship if driving half an hour to to pray which is not obligatory to begin with upon women to pray in the Masjid and it's best for them to pray in their homes we would say no don't go to such extent of hardship and the Imam that prays wit as M this is according to the hanfi school of thought which is wrong the other schools of thought disagree and follow the Sunnah and follow the Hadith where the Prophet prohibited following or or praying with her as in the m and he told us not to do so but either way they're following a reputable school of thought and this is the best of their knowledge so if you if even if you pray behind them inshallah the prayer is valid and Allah Knows Best"
