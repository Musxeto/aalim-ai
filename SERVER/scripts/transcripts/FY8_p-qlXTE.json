  "transcript": "question is from sister farida if parents do not pray five times don't pray zakat or fulfill any of their religious duties will their children suffer with hardships in this world no they will not insha allah suffer at all because allah is more generous than making someone who has nothing to do with his parents sins suffer accordingly so allah azza would not punish me for my father's sins even if he is the worst of human beings this is not part of allah's fairness and justice"
