  "transcript": "if i completed reciting the quran from cover to cover then what to do next what should i do next recently now pondering upon the quran again it's a way of life it's not just quantity that we're looking for yes quantity is virtuous rewardable we know that reciting one letter allah will grant you a good deed up to 10 deeds up to the fold of 700 and more so the more you read the more reward you get but the quran was revealed to be pondered upon and to be a reminder so just reciting it without pondering and without benefiting is not the ultimate choice so it is highly advisable to have a moment of pondering today so you go about reading your portion of the quran the minimum is one jesus per day which means every lunar month you finish the whole quran and then you start again and again and again every month you finish the quran but this is the minimum a better stage is to recite it twice a month so two jesus a day and some finish it once a week as some of the self used to now if you do this and you manage to recite it a lot without even trying you will be able to ponder upon many verses that come to your mind because it is grown into your heart it is firmly cemented into your heart because of your repetition if you add to that reciting a page or two or maybe more of tafsir it is important that you know when you go through little eyes like what is the meaning of assad i don't know okay if you don't know what are you gonna do i'm gonna stay don't know him no this is wrong go to the tafsir open the book read what the word means hmm this is one of allah's beautiful names it means this and this and this so now when you read it again allah ah now i feel differently when you recite for example that allah said lists the names of the prophets a lot of them 15 20 prophets so and so and so on so and so and so and then allah says to his messenger those whom allah had guided so through their guidance you should follow so you contemplate you ponder what should i do the eye is crystal clear no it's not crystal clear the ayah is so full and rich of meaning that allah is telling you to follow the guidance and not the individuals though they are prophets and messengers why because prophets and messengers are humans and we are supposed to follow the guidance each and every one of us may have shortcomings flaws though we believe that the prophets and messengers are perfect specimen of humanity yet they may have something that we are not supposed to follow the anger and strength of musa peace be upon him we're not allowed to follow this someone speaks to you punch him and kill him even if it was a mistake but no this is something not to be followed so allah is telling us to follow the guidance which means that if i pondered and reflected upon this ayah if i were to see an imam oh sheikh hasan he's a good he's scholar reputable person but he is he has arrogance in him he has anger issues these imams are bad they are evil wait wait wait wait what are you doing he claims to follow the quran and ponders upon him and look at his character it's the worst of people follow his guidance follow his knowledge follow his teachings don't follow his character if there were flaws in them this is what you get from this ayah so brother to recap if you reach the level of completing the quran it doesn't stop here you keep on doing it until the day you die you add to it reading the tafseer so that you understand and then third level is to contemplate of what does allah want to you what does the spirit of the ayah show you so that you can manage and follow that all right you"
