  "transcript": "okay I will use have had three questions and the first question is regarding an a spot in the grand Masjid of Medina the message of the Prophet Isis Aram and it's called real gender the area itself has a different type and color of carpet and people stay there and they fight over praying in that area so his question is what is the origin of this and it is it actually a piece of land from Jenna descended on the earth or not no the Prophet said RA salatu salam ma baina beatty remember I wrote on me religion what the distance between my house my house my home and my pulpit is an area or a garden of Jenna and this is not taken as the gender of the seventh heaven but rather that it would lead you if you sit there and you learn the knowledge and you worship Allah it's in the first straw it would lead you to Jenna now we find that it is not in the first row of the Masjid it is way back maybe fifth of sixth row so is it best to pray there or to pray the first row definitely it is better to pray in the first row behind the imam and people fighting there are wrong indeed"
