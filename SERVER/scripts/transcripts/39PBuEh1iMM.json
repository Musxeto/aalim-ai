  "title": "Congregational Dua after Prayer an Innovation? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abu Rayyan from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I wanted to make a little correction. I realize I made a mistake in my question of last week. I said that the Imam wanted to repeat the prayer. What I meant to say that he said he wanted to make a congregational dua and that he instructed us to say Ameen. That's what I wanted to ask. Is this permissible or not? After the congregational prayer? Yes, after the Hathr prayer, he wanted us to make a congregational dua for the dead person. No, this is not permissible. This is an innovation again. And this is not permissible to make congregational dua after Salat and ask people to say Ameen. As I stated before, if we want to make dua, we make dua in our own prayers. When in sujood or after salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ and before concluding the Salat with salam. These are the two places where the Prophet himself ﷺ recommended us to make dua. So to come and say no, we would like to make dua after the Salat and make it in congregation and say Ameen. That would be an innovation and Allah knows best."
