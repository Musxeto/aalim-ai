  "transcript": "a brother says are gay marriages illegal in islam if yes then any reasons specified in quran or hadith now probably this brother is not a muslim or he is a muslim but he's confused due to the fact that he's living in a kafir country and most kafir countries promote homosexuality lgbt etc i think they've added a cue to that lgbtq or the alphabet in in general i don't know um but homosexuality is prohibited in the bible so jews christians and the muslims all agree that homosexuality is a major sin and it is prohibited so when you ask about gay marriage usually this refers to same-sex marriage so a man marrying a man or a woman marrying a woman and this is an abnormality this is something that is not natural all human humans acknowledge that marriage even in in dictionaries even with atheists and those who do not believe in the existence of religion or anything else they define marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman to have a relationship between a man and a man or a woman and a woman this is not marriage this is homosexuality and it's a major sin in islam why is that because we have rules we have laws we have regulations given to us by the one who created us so allah azza told us that this is prohibited we're told in the bible we're told in the quran that the village of sudom was devastated was totally destroyed and the people annihilated because they used to commit the sin of homosexuality this is what allah tells us in the quran so as a muslim i do not believe in man-made laws so today they legitimize homosexuality 50 years ago it was a sin it was a crime that a person would be thrown in jail because of that so in 50 years things change how would i ensure that in 50 years time they would not legalize incest a man marrying his sister or daughter or mother i don't know maybe they're applying it at the moment how would i know that they would not legalize and give legitimacy to rape or to having illicit relationship with minors children and it goes on and on and this is why as muslims we believe that the rule should be only to allah the almighty the one who created the heavens and the earth who created us and knows what is best for us and i hope this answers your question"
