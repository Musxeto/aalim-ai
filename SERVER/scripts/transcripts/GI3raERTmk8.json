  "title": "Is a husband accountable for Wifeâ€™s  Sins? (wear tight clothes & interact with non-mahram men) Assim",
  "transcript": "have mahesh from the u.s sheikh my question is if a husband allows his wife to wear tight clothes or interact with men does he have the same sin a higher sin or no sin at all says if a man allows his wife to not abide by the hijab so he encourages her or at least is passive about it she wears tight jeans doesn't cover her hair wears makeup and goes out is he a lesser sinner or equal or a superior sinner to her this is something that is in allah's hands to judge that woman herself by no doubt is committing a huge sin that would qualify her to be among the people of hell sheikh but she prays and fasts even though the prophet told us allah that such a description fits the people of hell and rarely you will find such women entering paradise except like a certain description on crows the prophet is telling us which is rare in normal crows the coloring etc so she's sinful without any doubt now he's sinful for allowing her because he's the guardian he's the boss he's the captain of the airplane if the co-pilot does something against the captain's will they will crash his word is the final word that has to be heard and adhered to but when the husband himself is a wimp is not a real man and he sees his wife doing what she's doing and he's not stopping her now i'm not saying that he should divorce her or he should beat her i'm not saying that i say that be a man and act like a man this is your honor you have to have jealousy you have to have the right means and manners to stop her from doing that call the elders try to preach her try to advise her to try to give her counseling sessions whatever it is you need to do that at the end of the day she's your wife and allah stated in the quran in two places oh you who believe protect yourselves and your families from hell fire that's the fire of it is people and stones so allah is ordering you to protect yourself and your family she is your family you have to protect her if she doesn't adhere then you're sinful without any doubt in that but if you encourage her and give her lead way in this case you are as sinful if not more because you are facilitating that sin"
