  "transcript": "Noel from uh Malaysia Alum say my question regarding the Kun PR uh during the uh you know the Palestine War our maid almost all the maid around the Malaysia they conducted the kunut prayer for one month for Palestine and some Maj did stop it but some still continue on and off during the F prayer so what should we do the prayer okay as followers of the Imam when the Imam makes and this is known as the that is performed when a Calamity or catastrophe happens to the Muslims when the IM does it we say a mean whenever he makes the Dua we do not oppose what he's doing however the Sunnah is to do the kunut not only in one prayer rather in the five daily prayers so you do it in in in in and in some people only restrict this to F only and others restrict this to F and M only and this is or was said by some Scholars but the way of the Prophet was to make this kunut throughout the five daily prayers and the majority of Scholars say that it is a good thing to do to show our solidarity with the Muslims and the most authentic opinion is that it is to be done by the instruction and the Order of the Muslim Imam so your Muslim Imam of your country he orders the imams the Muslim ruler of your country orders the imams of the Masjid to make Kun they should comply with that if not then they should not do that my own personal opinion is that this kunut should be done to the area is afflicted by This calamity because if we keep on doing for everything that happens to the Muslims around the world we would never stop doing kunut throughout the whole year whether it's an earthquake in Morocco or floodings in Libya or a volcano in Indonesia or a tornado and flooding in Bangladesh or famine in Somalia or Wars in uh uh Syria or oppression of our brothers of and Sisters of the renja or ogre in in China or a war here and there this is going to continue throughout the whole year for decades and this is not what I personally believe to be logical or part of Islam yes there are calamities that may afflict our area our country our people and those people in that area or these countries may make and nail but others would not do this and Allah Asel Knows Best"
