  "transcript": "uh cd from germany um if a person has a problem with this recitation not only in the signing but also the loud and for him his recitation sounds so defective that it would even change the meaning but he's also able to correct it but with much uh effort and by also repeating it and this would be a burden for him so are such people exempted from reciting correctly so that they can pray with easiness and pray with concentration first of all it is mandatory upon a muslim to learn how to recite the quran properly especially when it comes to al-fatiha especially when it comes to ensuring that the meaning does not change and when a non-arab tries to do this he may find a lot of hardship simply because there are letters that he's unable to pronounce properly the a lot of even the arabs and our brethrens from the arabs this is and this is problematic they can say a lavina elsewhere but when it comes to the fatiha due to their laziness they don't and this according to the majority of scholars when you're able to do it and you refuse to do it or you're lazy to do it may invalidate your prayer but for non-arabs it's difficult to say marbouby so this difficulty and hardship it doubles their reward at the side of allah because they're doing their level best now if a person can rectify this and fix it so if i say him yes you have to repeat it but if it goes beyond recognition and he says and he repeats it like six seven times no this kind of hardship is overburdening him and it's too much and islam does not require you to do this do it to the best of your ability if you're not able move on nevertheless this does not exempt you from practicing and trying your level best outside of the prayer so you can master pronouncing these letters correctly in couple of days few days if you repeat it like a thousand times a day you will with repetition improve dramatically and drastically in illahi as a wajal you"
