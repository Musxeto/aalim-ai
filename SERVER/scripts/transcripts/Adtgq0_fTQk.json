  "transcript": "zid from bangladesh he said he heard the day saying that there are a thousand he can list a thousand thousand things that allah cannot do so he's asking is this blasphemous and should we continue to listen to this diary or not first of all there are things that we should be very selective when talking so for example the arabs say though it's true but the words describing it is not they say that if you say that this sword is sharper and more effective than a stick you would be humiliating the sword you can't compare this to that though the it's true it's more sharp it's sharper and it's more effective and stronger it does more harm but when you compare this to that you are discrediting the sword likewise when you say allah azzawajal cannot be unjust cannot be unfair allah azza cannot create another god all of these things are known by default by the description you saying i know a thousand things that allah cannot do what is understood from it for someone who did not listen to what you've said in the beginning and what uh uh and he did not listen to what you will explain and say at the end if one miscoached you by saying i know a thousand things that allah cannot do they would say oh this guy thinks if allah doesn't can't do a thousand things then he's not a real god then he's incapable blah blah they didn't cut your heart to look what's inside of it they did not know that you love allah azza and you honor allah then you respect allah and you call people to allah that you would never in a thousand years think to discredit allah or to dishonor allah or to mention anything bad about allah but this is what people perceive especially those who have illness in their hearts when people want to discredit you they will find any word they'll highlight it the put it in font double a bold font they will do everything to tarnish your reputation so you have to be very careful so the way it was said definitely it is not appropriate and it's not uh um accepted is it cover no of course not it's not definitely it's not kufur and we can't jump to conclusions by quoting people one phrase and say oh go for because we can give kuffer to everybody take fear to everybody but this is the trend of the hawari who jumped the gun anything you say ah kufr and they make everybody talk and they take everybody out of the fault of islam this is not the way of ali sunnah with jamaa and allah knows best"
