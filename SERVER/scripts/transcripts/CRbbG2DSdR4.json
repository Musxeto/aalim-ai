  "title": "Forgive Sorcerers or ones who did Black Magic? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Halima from France. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Okay sir, thank you very much sir. I have a problem of black magic which is sometimes very scary. So I read inside the Quran that Allah says all prophets tell the believers to forgive those that do not fear the Day of Torment so that it will reward each group for what they used to commit. So my question is, does this apply to the sorcerers and jinns too? No, no it does not apply to the sorcerers from your side, but it applies to any mushrik, any sorcerer, any soothsayer, that Allah is giving them a way out of their evil, and if they were to abandon these major kufr and shirk and return to Allah with repentance and remorse, Allah will forgive their previous sins. Not that we have to forgive them, this is not mandatory upon us to forgive them, but this is a call for them to repent to Allah and to rectify their affairs and Allah knows best."
