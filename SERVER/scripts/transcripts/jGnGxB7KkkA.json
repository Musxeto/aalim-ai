  "transcript": "so okay maybe perhaps on the topic of marriage as well on the side of the ones who do want to get married so i i guess uh for the practicing brothers and sisters out there who genuinely want to look for partners they recognize that you know that marriage is perhaps a lifetime commitment it's gonna be somebody who's gonna be the mother of your children the father of your children and so kind of people have this um this idea that you need to find that ideal righteous spouse but it's also kind of difficult because like how how do you pass over like you said like when people pass away these wedding invitations or wedding proposals because they feel that maybe they don't quite meet the standards of what they feel meets that righteous criteria so maybe can you advise some guidelines on how our brothers and sisters out there can you know maybe to address this issue between ocd and quality for example but if i can put it that way okay this is a very long topic and on youtube i did a course about 10 years ago in chennai madras in india it's called half deen hd and it talks about the qualities of marriage and how things are happening but in a nutshell no one is perfect and the thing that makes you turn down so many proposals is that you did not look in the mirror lately so when a woman says no no no he's a little bit short he's a little bit fat he's is bald he doesn't look good he's white he's dark he's this he's that i want him to be uh muscular i want him to be rich i want him to be sister take a good look in the mirror you're not miss universe 2015 not even 1880 you're not miss universe you yourself have so many flaws so you have to lower your bar a little bit so you have to look in the general tendency i get many questions on my website someone who's very very religious a well-dec high decorated student of knowledge he has a good job and he comes from a good family he's the best in moral conduct and ethics but i don't like how he looks should i uh accept the proposal i said no let him marry someone who's much beautiful younger and more religious because women don't see and also men don't see when i when someone comes to me from the family and says i want you to get married okay what do you want in your uh future wife oh she has to be white and her hair is silk and she has to be thin and she has to be highly educated preferably speaking two or three languages and if she memorizes the quran and the six hadith books and before uh committing to islam she was a ballerina and she knows how to play the violin and she has six dan uh cylinder what look at you you're short fat ugly and you want this uh beauty queen and what do you have you want her a highly decorated student of knowledge do you remember as the quran no do you preach in the masjid wallahi once every month but i want a good mother for my kids it's torture this is not fair it's not balanced so my advice in in in in a nutshell when you look at a future potential spouse look generally right things that you cannot live with is a man or husband who is angry has rage problems abusive no no this is totally out of the question even is a billionaire totally out of the question if a woman is known to be loud shouting in the market uh cursing her parents i know people like this you stay away from her if someone is not practicing you're a muslim practicing man and she's not wearing the hijab or not praying on time and you say inshallah i will pray to allah that no no no this is gambling okay because tomorrow she's pregnant you have three kids and she's still not abiding by the hijab and not praying on time what are you gonna do you've wasted your life and the life of the your children so look at the general tendency if your suitor is well known among his relatives and friends that he's stingy he doesn't give he keeps hoarding the money don't ever marry him marry someone who's generous not a spent theft but someone who's known to be generous to be kind someone who's loving and caring to his sister and mother because he will take care of you and so on okay so thanks for clarifying that you're not available so i think you want to appreciate that in the comment section thank you good luck to remind all of you if you have any pearls of wisdom any brilliant nuggets of wisdom that you caught throughout these talks please do share them at the comment section and also in your personal social media posts uh put a hashtag tsp2021 and put a hashtag be steadfast i've already uploaded one at least so i'm gonna try and upload more mashallah a lot of brilliant points of wisdom so far even from these two talks masha'allah"
