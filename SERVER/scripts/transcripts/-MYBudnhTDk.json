  "title": "Can we give haram items to charity or must we destroy it Books with haram pics or clothes",
  "transcript": "from australia if we buy something that is haram let's assume we bought books that had haram drawings this is not how we look at things because we buy diapers and it has haram pictures on it so we should refrain from buying diapers no if the book as a whole is something that's beneficial so it's a book on biology and we know books of biology contain a lot of pictures and maybe sometimes private parts etc but it is a scientific book there's no problem in that this is different from buying a novel or a book which has photos of nudity while talking about the book or the content of the novel is haram in this case yes you may not give it to charity you have to dispose of it if you have clothes with drawings on them of humans or animals which is haram you cannot give it to charity because this picture or drawing has to be removed either by putting paint on the head or tearing it all apart and allah knows best this"
