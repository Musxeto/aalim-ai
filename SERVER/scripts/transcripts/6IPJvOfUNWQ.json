  "transcript": "second question of consumers can we supplicate to someone without mentioning his name the answer is yes but when I hear such questions what comes up to my mind is how lazy we are when it comes to things that we beg from a large soldier for example people come and say I'm a croupier so I recite the freakin bull who Allahu Ahad cool are adorable fella pool are all Dubrow business do I have to say bismillah in the beginning subhanAllah the guy has jinn he's got black magic he's at envy or an evil eye he wants and he needs a larger will to save him and cure him yet he's lazy to do the simple task of saying bismillah alrahman alraheem and you want to make dua for a dear friend or a relative or someone you love and care about you find it difficult and time-consuming to say o allah guide abdullah to do whatever you you like or guide abdullah to pray five times a day you just want to say guide him this is not logical but because the question is as you had heard the answer is yes if you use a pronoun and you refer to him by him or whatever this is permissible yet it is not as best"
