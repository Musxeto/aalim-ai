  "transcript": "my question is i am suffering from urine incontinence so it is very difficult for me to wash the affected area undergarment every time so if i pray on impure clothes without washing do i consider as kafir as i'm offering prayer in impure clothes so if i watch in second scenario if i watch the undergarment it will become it will not become dry till the next prayer it will be wet between the time if i go to the toilet and pass the urine and drop of hearing aid on the white garment i will answer inshallah i will answer you hidden from india says i have a urine incontinence and when i wash my private part and uh sprinkle water on my uh underwear it remains damp and wet until the other prayer so i don't know whether there is drops of urine or not the issues of your incontinence is a long topic and i would highly advise you to book a counseling session with me if you can afford it so that we can talk about it and open your eyes about the reality if you cannot afford it still give it a try we may assign a free session for you insha allah but this is essential because most of those who think they have your incontinence do not have it i'm saying most like 95 98 and it is easily cured alhamdulillah and i have the track record to prove that so many people have been cured with it with the grace of allah and they don't suffer from it anymore why because all what they need to know is to understand how shaytan messes up with their head and confuses them though the issues of purity is so easy that people have been urinating since the time of adam and if you look around you if you ask your relatives and your friends nobody faces the same doubts and whispers that you're suffering from so are you more righteous are you more favored to allah that you're so careful about these things or you are doomed through listening and adhering to whispers of shaytaan everybody urinates in two to three minutes and they don't suffer from anything afterwards why do you spend 10 to 15 minutes urinating or half an hour at some point why do you repeat the waldo over and over and over and over again and clean the floors and the walls of the toilet and the faucets and toilet seat and maybe have a shower is this part of the sunnah do you know more than the prophet hassam or the taberine or the sahaba or tavere tabbing of course not then the problem is in here and once you know how to see this problem and understand it it will go away inshallah you"
