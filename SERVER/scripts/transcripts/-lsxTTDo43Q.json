  "transcript": "um on to the next question regards with marriage a muslim man married a non-muslim woman and she still practices her previous lifestyle so how should the husband advise her and what is considered permissible of course we know that most men must must not marry except a jew a christian or a muslim woman so they cannot marry hindu or seek or atheists or buddhists etc this is totally prohibited in islam if she is a christian this is mainly uh the case um and she still practices her old ways if you mean that she is flirting with other men this is not permissible because you cannot marry someone who is not chased in order for you to marry a christian woman she has to be chased not having boyfriends that partying not doing haram activities and this is rare but it's found you can find this and if you mean by her old ways that she's not abiding by the proper uh clothes clothes and dress code again this is your mistake you chose her you left more than 1.2 billion women muslims available and you chose this disbeliever now you're crying now you are complaining that you were walking uh uh in the mall and she saw a stranger and she hugged him and kissed him and she said he's my schoolmate and we were in he was uh uh with me in this and that and as a civilized muslim of course yes i will also kiss him what are you doing you brought this to yourself then why are you complaining so my idea or my point is that i'm making before you make a choice this is a life choice even taking a bad muslim woman is not something that is recommended because a bad muslim woman may be as bad as a that disbeliever choose the mother of your children choose the one who you would love to come back home to every single day rather than suffer for the rest of your life subhan allah we have reached the end of our third session of the conference please keep on sharing any pearls of wisdom that you have gained throughout the session on your social media with the hashtag tsp2021 be steadfast uh we do have some live polling uh session going on in our telegram uh group chat so if you are in it please do um participate in our polls our fourth and final session tomorrow uh which is on the 28th of march 2021 will begin at 2 30 p.m malaysian time inshallah"
