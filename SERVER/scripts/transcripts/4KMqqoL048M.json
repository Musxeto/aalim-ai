  "transcript": "Hania says, if I give my shop for rent to a barber, will his rent money? Will be haram for me? As many barbers do haram haircuts, shave beards, etc. Allah Azza Wa Jal mentioned in the beginning of Surah Al-Ma'idah, وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالْتَقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ Collaborate upon righteousness and virtue, and do not collaborate upon sin and transgression. So when I assist someone in doing haram, I have a portion of that haram that was committed due to my assistance. And if I rent my shop to a bank that deals with riba, an interest bank, a conventional bank, or if I give my shop or premises to a place that is used in haram, a bar, a brothel, and the likes, then my rent is haram. Likewise, if those working in this barber shop do haram things, haram haircut, they shave beards, they maybe do facial, I don't know what they call it, makeup or whatever, you know, pluck eyebrows and the likes, then definitely what they're earning is haram, and the rent they're paying me is haram for me for collaborating with them on such a sin."
