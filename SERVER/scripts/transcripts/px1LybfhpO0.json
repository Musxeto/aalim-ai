  "title": "How much Zamzam to add to NORMAL water to make it Zamzam?",
  "transcript": "finally Arif says how much zamzam water do we have to add to normal water for it to also become zamzam water this is a concept A misconception that a lot of the Muslims believe that they can keep on adding water to little amount of Zam Zam and the whole thing would become zamzam this is not true adding normal water to zamzam water would give it some of the blessing of zamzam and yes it can be also used to heal and cure illnesses like zamzam but it depends on the amount so if one has a liter of zamzam and another person has 100 milliliters of zamzam and adds 900 milliliters of normal water would they be the same of course not the one one with the one liter pure Zam zum has more benefits and healing powers and answering of the Dua and Bara than the one that has 100 milliliters and added 900 mL of normal water to it nevertheless this is better than normal water at all because it has this little amount of Zam Zam so the scholars say it all depends on the ratio the more the zamzam water is the more blessing and healing power it has with the grace of Allah and hence if someone were to make an oath and says if I drink other than zamzam I will nullify my uh oath and he drinks this water that has 900 Mill of normal water and 100 milliters of zamzam Scholars say he has to exate his oath because he did not fulfill it and Allah Knows Best"
