  "transcript": "In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah and his family and companions and those who are guided by his guidance. My name is Asim Al-Hakeem and I'm honoured to be teaching you this first semester the seerah of our Prophet ï·º or the biography of our Prophet ï·º. It is one of the important subjects that students of knowledge must study and know because it deals with the life of our Prophet ï·º, our role model, the example that we are told to follow. So it talks, Inshallah, briefly about his life since his birth till when he was 40 years of age, how he grew up in Mecca. And then it talks about the Mecca period which is from him being 40 years of age till 53, 13 years he spent in Mecca, how the revelation started, how he became a prophet, then how he became a messenger and how he started his da'wah for three years secretly, then went public. And some of the events that took place in this Mecca period including migrating to Abyssinia, the hardship, the persecution he and his companions had faced. Then we speak about the Madani period or the period of Medina when the Prophet migrated ï·º and this was a 10 year period from when he was 53 years of age till he died when he was 63 years of age, which we will speak also about his wives. This is a combination between the Mecca and the Medina period. We will speak about his expeditions, about the battles, we will speak about his life, the covenants he had with the different tribes, with the Jews, the Muhajireen and the Ansar and how the Prophet ï·º travelled in different battles. And in different endeavours, how the Prophet ï·º met the different delegations coming to him from all over Arabia, the conquest of Mecca, the battles that he went through himself ï·º. And we will conclude that with the last chapter, the death of our Prophet ï·º which concludes his biography but definitely does not conclude the glorious spread of this beautiful religion that you and I are finding the fruits of and enjoying with the grace of Allah. This is a journey that we hope we would go together through and that we would benefit in our lives and that would hopefully benefit us in the hereafter. So waiting eagerly and anxiously to see you there bi-idhnillah. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Al Fatiha."
