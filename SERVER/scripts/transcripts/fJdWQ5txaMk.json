  "transcript": "Ibrahim from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Um, like, uh, must we say salutations on the Prophet ﷺ? Like, uh, in Hadith where it's not mentioned, like in Hadith Jibreel, uh, it says, uh, And also, like, in the Khutbah, Du'a, like, at the beginning, uh, in Alhamdulillah and so on. So, do we have to say Salatu Salam? Wa Fikum Baraka Allah. The salutation upon the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is a highly recommended thing when you hear his name. And the Prophet said, The most stingy of all people are those who hear my name and do not offer salutation upon me. And in Surah Al-Ahzab, Chapter 33, Allah mentions to us that he himself, Subhanahu wa ta'ala, and the angels offer salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ. Therefore, you, believers, offer salutation upon him ﷺ. So, if your love is genuine to him ﷺ, whenever you hear his name, you would mention this salutation, the short one, not the Ibrahimi long one, rather than Allahumma Salli wa Sallim ala Muhammad and that is about it."
