  "title": "Washing Hands 3 Times After Waking Up but what if I touch something before washing, is it Najis?",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Cyprus.   I have a question about a hadith I learned about \nrecently saying that when you wake up you must   wash your hands instead of putting your hands \ninside a bucket because it might get contaminated.   So what if for example you touch - if I didn't \nknow that if I forgot about the hadith then   I wake up then maybe touch a wet substance does \nthat mean that it can contaminate somewhere else? The hadith does not say because \nit was contaminated does it?   As in you don't know where your hands have \nbeen. Okay, so it does not say anything about   contamination it simply says you don't know where \nyour hands have been. So the hadith is definitely   authentic the Prophet ﷺ when someone of you \nwakes up from night or from sleeping he must   wash his hands three times before inserting them \nin the bucket because he does not know where his   hands were, he doesn't know where his hands were \nmeaning while sleeping. Remember that they did   not have any faucets so in order for them to scoop \nwater in these days they used to put their hands   in the bucket and wash their faces or use it for \nany other purposes. Now this hadith is as it is.   So some scholars said okay what about \nthe ruling if I were to wear gloves   and go to bed and when I wake up I take off \nmy gloves can I put my hands? The answer is no   because again the hadith does not insinuate that \nyou touch your private part or in an impurity   it can mean that you don't know what Satan \ndid to your hands, something that you cannot   visibly see. So we take the hadith and we \nexecute it as a form of worship not due to   a logical reason that stands behind it. Simply we \nwash our hands why? Because the Prophet ﷺ said so   and this is very simple likewise when we wake \nup the Prophet ﷺ told us to blow our nose   three times. So we inhale water up our nostrils \nand blow the water three times why? Here the   Prophet ﷺ says because Satan slept on the opening \nof your nostrils so we are cleansing it through   this action. We did not see Satan we did not \nsee any leftovers of Satan we simply believe   in the unseen which the Prophet ﷺ had told us \nabout and I hope this answers your question."
