  "transcript": "Abdul Hameed from South Africa Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I have a question with regards to a husband gifting all his belongings to his wife in his lifetime Without the knowledge of any of his years or siblings So and since he's passed on does this gift still count as The only evidence of this gift is the word of mouth of his wife No, the answer is no the wife gets nothing but the share of Sharia Allocated for her if the man had a Child or more she gets one-eighth if the man was childish Well, this is not the right Adjective to be used if he was without any children Then she gets one-quarter of his wealth the gift to a spouse in the lifetime of the one giving has to be actual and real where the spouse possesses the gift and Owns it and the deeds are transferred in the spouse's name a promise That has no witnesses or proof is Not binding and it is invalid after the death of the giver and Allah knows best"
