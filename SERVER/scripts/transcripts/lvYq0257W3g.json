  "transcript": "fatima says can you pray nephil salat with the knee of thanking shukrana to allah between brackets salah to sugar to answer your questions specifically fatima salatu or what's known as shokrana is an issue of dispute and the prayer to express your gratitude specifically for a blessing or a favor from allah azzawajal is an issue of dispute once we go and check all the hadiths related to it we find that they are all weak and it is not authentic the prophet salallahu salaam whenever he had a favor or of or a blessing from allah that is totally new and genuine he would offer one prostration for expressing his gratitude so if he hears of an army of the muslims that won a battle he prostrates for gratitude the murder of one of the enemies of islam he offers such a prostration to express his thanks and gratitude to allah azzawajal likewise if we hear that an uncle or a loved one was in the icu then went uh uh or under went uh a surgery and then we heard the news that alhamdulillah now he's safe and sound we offer such a prostration one prostration then what about salatu all the hadiths are not authentic so we do not offer them however the concept of offering good deeds for a specific or blessing or favor from allah azzawajal to us this is not part of islam and it would be an innovation so i want to fast a day because allah azzawajal made my daughter pass the final exams this is an innovation when we look at allah's favors upon us we find that allah has blessed us with health with wealth with safety and security with a family and relatives and above all allah's favors and blessings is indeed the blessing of islam and this is why allah says today i have completed your religion that is islam and also perfected my favor upon you and came to a conclusion with my favors by presenting you this nirma this deen this religion so in order to be grateful for allah's favors and blessings your belief and conviction that allah is the only god worthy of being worshiped your devotion your sincerity your belief in the messengers and the hereafter and the angels and the holy scriptures in the predestiny whether good or bad all of this is part of your expression of gratitude your prayers your fasting whatever you do of good deeds complying to what allah has told you to do and whenever you refrain from haram all of these are part of showing allah azza your gratitude and this is why allah says in the quran o family of david that would peace be upon him act and offer good deeds as part of your gratitude and seldom of my servants would be thankful and grateful so this is the best way of expressing your gratitude to allah azzawajal generally speaking not on a particular blessing that he had given you because this is not part of islam and allah knows best"
