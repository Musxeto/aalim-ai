  "transcript": "muhammad from canada yes so i have a question uh so i want to sell something so before i sell the product i want to know if there is a demand for it so can i put this product for sale but not actually sell it to see if there's a demand and then maybe sell it later on okay i will answer inshallah from canada says he has a an item to be sold but he doesn't know how much it will get so he wanted to display it on the internet to see the response of people but he doesn't want to sell it anyhow is this permissible there's no problem in that because between the buyer and the seller there has to be agreement so if i display this pen for sale someone gives me ten dollars i said no i'm not interested another gives me a hundred dollars and it's only 50 cent so i said no i don't want it and i decline there's no sin on me because i wanted to know how much it would get me and there's nothing wrong you"
