  "title": "Family - The Fortified Shield | The Straight Path Convention 2023 Sh. Assim Al Hakeem (long lecture)",
  "transcript": "my name is Alim I am from Saudi Arabia and I've been with the straight path convention for the past let's say 40 years 5 years who's counting it is alhamdulillah a very successful event it is beneficial where we get to meet and listen to brothers from all over the world who are are joined on the correct AA and on calling people to Quran and to the Sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors of the salf with moderation with a lot of hikma and wisdom in their preaching so I call my brothers and sisters to join us inshallah if we get to live inshallah that long so I hope to see you there and until then I leave you [Music] alhamdulillah wasallam [Music] first of all a disclaimer these topics are not my cup of tea so you know me you know my topics Halal Haram go to hell go to Jenna this is what I do best but when it comes to social aspects and deep things this is way above my pay grade my thinking yeah I'm I'm not an academic okay so yeah bear with me after lunch you may fall asleep I completely forgive you you have no problem I didn't have lunch so yeah I would understand inshallah and I'll try my level best to be as informative because this is why we're here why are we here we are here to learn we are here to improve and we are here to fix something that is broken and without a doubt a lot of our families unfortunately are broken and they need fixing the problem is that once they saw a camel and the camel was laughing his head off so they said to the camel why are you laughing he said look at all these camels they have a strange hump on their back nobody's laughing okay now now now you understand why was the camel laughing because it could not see see even if I get closer it's not working now okay so the camel was laughing because it could not see its own hump and unfortunately our problems come from the fact that we are unable to see our own shortcomings and faults this is why why am I having problems with my spouse why am I not being able to communicate with my children and when you sit with an elder in the family or an outsider he opens your eyes you say I didn't see that I didn't know that so this Gathering is in a way something to help you open your eyes and if you are unable to open your eyes you need to check the doctor first of all marriage is a beautiful miracle from Allah it's a sign of Allah's one subhanahu waala Allah says and of his signs is that he created for you from yourselves mates that you may find Tranquility in them and he placed between you that is The spouse's affection and mercy indeed in that are signs for people who give thought so this is a sign from Allah that we have spouse houses and this is the nucleus of the society the family and family in legislative terminology is the social unit which preserves Mankind and it's composed of a man and a woman what about transgenders we're not going there there is only only a man and a woman not no third gender nothing else and they are affiliated Associated through marriage not through illicit relationships and from that marriage we have children that would make a family a society a country a nation and so forth and because this family is the last line of defense enemies of Islam Target it big time whether you can see that or not and hence there are many many and I mean many threats that face our family we're talking about Muslims we don't talk about other religions they have their own gurus and their own teachers and uh uh social workers we talk about our own religion as Muslims what are the greatest dangers some because we don't have enough time what are the greatest dangers that face the Muslim family there are external dangers and there are dangers where with from within internally dangers so among the internal dangers and this is on the top of the food chain is the weakness of Iman and if there is weakness of Iman in the family say bye-bye to the family the family has gone down the drain don't be fooled by how they look how beautiful how modern how rich how well educated this is all superficial not real if you just go inside the house and sit for five minutes you will see the reality don't be impressed by Instagram oh this family is so gorgeous they have fast cars they have a beautiful house the children are very nicely dressed no without IM everything is down the drain the prophet wasam told us that a woman may be married for four things she's sought after why would a man marry a woman for four things her wealth her lineage her beauty and her religious commitment so seek the one who is religiously committed may your hands be rubbed with dust meaning that may you prosper if you do so may you prosper inshallah go for the religious commitment okay Sheik why what would I do with a religious woman who's ugly and from a poor from a a poor family and doesn't have any lineage the prophet didn't say that but he said your priority is to be what religiously committed what is the use of marrying Miss Universe when she is a slot excuse my French I want a mother for my children I want someone to teach my children how to read the fa to teach my daughter how to wear the hijab to teach my son how to observe Salat on time what is the use of her wealth if she is the daughter of Ellen Musk the good one not the homo what is the use if I marry her and every day she says didn't guy give you a Tesla didn't I do didn't I take you to the space every single day she's reminding me of her wealth but when you marry someone who's religious this overwhelms all her shortcomings and when you choose the one with religion this reflects in your family family how Allah says and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed and difficult life why do we have depression many children come to me Teenage I have depression I take anti-depressants I have counseling sessions I go to therapies this is in the Muslim World children in their tens and 11 years of age go to therapy s why because they have no IM they don't know Allah and this is the house that we're talking about how is your house does it have these threats or it's a house filled with Ean go to in Muslim house what do you see I go to Muslim houses a lot I'm talking about 95% what do I see mashallah a piano a guitar what is this no no no this is the decoration she but it works if you want to you see statues of an elephant of ducks of uh uh um Crystal Dolphins this prevents angels from entering this is that was in stone stone cold ages nowadays alhamdulillah we're modern we don't we're not going to worship this but still it's Haram so people's perception of Islam totally changed you go to the living room and you see portraits of the man and his wife and daughters I look down say she this is my wife and he's giv me a tour guide fear Allah this is Haram I cannot see this no no she it's okay you're a Sheikh I am a male yeah yeah but you're sheh it's what is this there is something wrong in people's thinking because they're far away from Islam they don't have Islam as their Beacon that shows them where to go and where not to go so Iman is the first internal threat for our houses for our not Iman let me rephrase that this thing works by itself so that's good I can speak freely of Iman is what we are threatened by and if we have Iman in our homes then it's a fortress what does the prophet say he says the best treasure a person could have is a grateful heart a remembering tongue and a righteous woman that supports him on his religious Affairs this is the best Fortune no money and no Tesla for sure but what a remembering tongue you always remember Subhan Allah alhamdulillah and a grateful heart you never look at things that you don't have and say why they gave me this cup of coffee I've seen people having big classes why this small small cup for a small man I'm not a small man no I say people can't even get a drink of water people pay for this I get it for free it's recycled I look at the positive side this is a grateful heart and a righteous spouse a righteous spouse who helps you Salam alaykum honey did you pray fjer today oh don't forget to do your Witter did you read your J of Quran by the way tomorrow is U Sunday Monday or whatever you you fast you do this you do she helps you to do good things this is the best treasure in life this is the first threat of internal threats like this I think I think we'll finish by m that was easier than I thought number two the biggest of of the biggest threats neglecting your marital responsibilities every marriage has rights and responsibilities the moment we focus only on on our rights we lose because when we focus on our rights we neglect our our responsibilities so many husbands are so uptight so rough and tough and strict without any Islamic justification and on the opposite side so many wives are rebellious are disobedient are disrespectful and not doing their duties without any Justus if iable Islamic reason this divides and not unite this destroys and demolishes and does not build if each of the spouses knew their responsibilities life would go on easily and if every spouse does what he has to do with cont sent and with pleasure and he's kind or she's kind when they request their rights and they're patient and they are realistic in this atmosphere the man respects his wife and the woman respects her husband among ignoring the marital rights in some joint family I did not see here in Malaysia alhamdulillah but in the subcontinent for example they have joint families and it's a customs the son gets married he has to live with his wife in the parents' house his parents and she becomes the new servant so she serves the parents she serves the brothers and sisters-in-law and their children she cooks she cleans and she cannot complain she does not have her privacy this definitely is one of the greatest threats because it deprives deprives a woman from her god-given right you did not marry a mate you married a woman and in Islam she's oblig you're obliged to provide her with an adequate place to live with a private kitchen and a bathroom or a toilet where she can lock herself in her quarters nobody can come in or out without her permission unlike what's happening and this is something that in dangers the safety or of our families number three the imbalance in the natural roles of the man and the wife in the family if the man spends most of his time working studying playing social activities even dawa work neglecting the children neglecting the wife neglecting his responsibilities he comes late at night to eat and sleep wake up early to go when is he going to take care of his family to teach them to guide them to me Mentor them if he doesn't do this job who fills in his shoes his wife but his wife is not qualified to do all of this and this is why Allah has given each of the man and the woman their roles there are there is no equ equality between man and woman there is fairness there is justice but there is no equality otherwise I will become pregnant next year she says this is not fair I gave you so many kids next year you become pregnant okay no it's it doesn't work this way I have to provide I have to work I have to discipline I am the captain of the airplane and you my wife you are the queen of the house you take care of it you clean it you fix the food you take care of my children but you're a co-pilot and I'm the captain I am in command if I say descend to 2,000 ft you obey if I say let's go right bearing 250 or this or you obey imagine if the captain says descend and the copile says I don't think so I like to see the sunset it's it's not time for emotional moments and and no no I'd like to see it the the airplane will fall the same thing with the house so this guardianship this role of the protector in Arabic is called this is mentioned in the Quran in verse 34 Allah in chapter 4 men are guardian and Protectors of women so the role of man cannot be neglected even with all the feminist calls no you're equal you can do this you don't have to listen to a man you don't lots of women who have these feminist ideas are not married and they will still be to be unmarried until they want to get married they change don't listen to them listen to The Prophet Alat wasam who said if I were to order someone to prostrate to someone else I would ordered a wife to prostrate to her husband whoa what is this this is Islam and also the Prophet saidat by the one who my soul is in his hand who's he Allah the prophet is is swearing is is saying that wall the one who has my soul in his hand a woman will not fulfill her Lord's rights until she fulfills her husband's right what does this tell you it tells you that we have a big huge problem in our homes I do counseling sessions when I sit and listen to the men and women complaining I can see where women are coming from but no you are making a huge mistake by treating your husband in such a fashion this is why when the the the Ki the guardianship of man is absent and the woman takes the responsibility you are overloading her far more than what she is equipped to handle and this is transgression this is and this is Injustice to the whole community and Allah asael stated that even when a woman is unable to get her rights from her husband we have to reconcile we have to bring Med uh someone to Med mediate mediate yes and to arbitrate between them to fix it but at the end of the day it's the man who's in control fourthly one of the threats the internal threats that threaten our families is the lack of respect and this is visible between the spouses a man doesn't resp respect his wife he belittles her he makes fun of her he criticizes the way she looks mashallah what is this when I married you were not this fat you come in a compact economical size what is this family size look do something go to the gym hit your gym look at your hair you never do your hair you never we wear makeup and weren't you lighter than this you became darker this is this is actual this is happening men are complaining to their wives with such harsh remarks and the women are poor they don't speak back well not all of them but she could have easily said look in the mirror schmu if you look in the mirror look at your belly mashallah you don't even see your toes if you look down you can't see your toes anymore because of your big fat belly and look at your mouth how it smells and your teeth and the way you we can do this all day long this kind of disrespect is ruining the homes and especially if this disrespect happens in front of the children then your children are going to grow up to be violent to be criminals to be rude to have a very bad marriage and relationships because of you how many of you when they have a dispute with the children with with the wife or with the spouse they take their dirty laundry in front of the children shouting and screaming and calling names most of us why because we are irresponsible we don't look beyond the tip of our noses and we don't weigh the gravity of such Behavior Behavior also the disrespect between the siblings when youngsters don't respect the elders this is problematic and especially in male dominated families when the youngster 16 17 years of age because he's a male disrespects his 30-year-old sister because she's a female don't do this don't do that no you do this go and cook me some food where did he see this Behavior coming from from his father this is how his father speaks to his mother to his sisters to any female and this is what we find us some of us Arabs when we go to a grocery shop and the man selling behind the counter is not a local he's not a native he's from this country he's a a foreigner so we we see the child with his father coming in and the child says hey hey hey give me uh Cola he's talking to a man who is 30 40 50 years of age like this and I look at the father waiting for him to reprimand his son and the father thankfully says hey hey don't you listen what to says what do you expect like Father Subhan Allah so this is something we have to instill in our children the respect of age when my elder brother comes in I stand up and I give him my chair I don't let him serve he's my elder brother he has the respect when he speaks I of course nowadays when I go to places because I'm the Sheikh all my Elder Brothers don't speak in my presence but I try my level best not to correct them not to say anything to be respectful because they're my Elder Brothers still yes so okay I'm in my mid 60s but still they're older than me and we have a saying in Arabic one day older than you one year more knowledgeable than you so age has respect what how much time do we have 10 minutes three seriously this is all internal uh uh number what okay five lack of communication the biggest threat 1 two three four all biggest biggest it's this is what's written so yeah so it's one of the biggest threats lack of communication when we fail to communicate as a man and a wife she speaks gibberish and I speak a different language and we speak speak speak but none of us can understand the other this is problematic then what would would be the best solution is to listen so many times siblings communicate but they don't they shout you give me this you give me that you do do this and they don't listen to one another in order to be heard you have to listen so let them speak and show some compassion when someone speaks to you say h oh yeah oh really I didn't know ah I see where you're coming from but let me explain to you my point of view how would you feel just saying that I see where you're coming from and I understand your point of view you diffused 50% of the problem our problem is the moment you speak no no no no no I know I know no no no no I know no let me explain but let me finish my point I do this a lot unfortunately because sometimes Shan makes me think I'm smart so when someone says sheh I have a problem I know I know I know your problem see she this is not can you name this tune no no I didn't say my problem no no I know I know sometimes they say the beginning of the question 95% I know the rest of the question but it is impolite wait for them and say m sometimes I do this with my kids and with my wife a lot the poor thing the poor thing she starts to say a story story or a joke or says once and I know the story I say yeah I know the story no it was not like this even before she completes this is totally impolite now I do it out of fun out of making people laugh the one Speaking is not laughing they're offended now okay after 40 Years of uh um life sentence and no parole alhamdulillah my my wife understands me she knows me but she begs me don't do this in front of the grandchildren they will understand and she's right my my daughters understand me and they know so they are reserved you know instead of being tensed of feeling that there's a fight going to happen they know that we're just mocking around and the guns are they don't have any bullets is planks so but you have to put yourself in other people's shoes to understand finally among the internal threats is selfishness and this is prevailing in all of our homes me the whole family revolves around me and this is an extremely dangerous thing we revolve around the family and as the Three Musketeers used to say one for allall they're all French and English literature major so we revolve around the family we live to our family to prosperous and to progress and to move forward not the opposite now children the moment they are a little bit independent I'm moving out where you're still young you're a teenager no no I'm moving out with my friends unfortunately even girls they move out alone not married they just want to move out from the it's too toxic here this is Haram and thinking like this endangers the family Big Time make the family your Center and you serve it not the opposite uh uh way so external threats how much s minutes seven minutes now this is not fair and I think next time I'm going to sit down because because I'm getting drowsy no seriously I'm getting drowsy um external threats plenty even if I just mentioned to you the name you can make a lecture out of it real lecture number one Bad Company agree the worst of all threats is Bad Company your husband has a bad friend your wife has an evil friend your children have bad company what will happen brainwash the prophet saidat wasam the likeness of a good companion is that of one who carries perfume so the prophet is telling us a good companion is like someone who's carrying or selling perfume how much is it it says this is so and so and he gives you a test okay thank you that's a good companion what did I gain a good scent either I buy either he gives me or at least just going inside the the the shop and coming out I smell Beautiful the bad companion is like someone who's a blacksmith blowing working the Bellows so if I go inside if the sparks don't burn my clothes the least is when I go home my my wife says o what is this smell this is the bad companion and this is why aliali may Allah be pleased with him said do not accompany or bef friend with a bad person because he would always wish you are like him and those who don't smoke know this when you s when you sit with a smoker how does he feel don't you like to try yeah he smokes and he feels embarrassed because you don't smoke likewise a woman who doesn't wear the hijab when she goes out with a woman who wears the hijab she's embarrassed I wish she takes off her hijab or maybe a little bit of her hair comes out or she does something Haram this is human nature I don't like to see you better than me if you're like me in sin you're good you're BOS but if you're not then I'm hesitant this is the bad influence and we have a lot of this but time does not permit external threats social media platforms the worst of all companions how much time do you spend on your social media platforms a day six days six hours five hours average of five hours a day and I said this in my lecture on Thursday if you spend 10% of this time every day on seeking knowledge in six months you will be a Sheikh seriously if you spend an hour a day seeking knowledge proper knowledge W in six month you'll be a Sheikh how do you think I became a Sheikh a little bit more but seriously I'm I'm not joking it doesn't take much people say sh please I'd like to be faith I'd like to be a scholar how can I do this say knowledge but if you don't have it in you it won't happen and social uh media platforms are the main cause for brainwashing the main cause for dismantling families the main cause of diluting your religion this is why everything is halal now sisters come to me after lectures here in Malaysia after giving a lecture for an hour about uh um free mixing and Haram and men and women should be segregated W two sisters came to me youngsters the age of my daughters uh sheh can we have a selfie I said daughters what did I just preach for an hour they said no no no no no I know seclusion is Haram no to both of us oh Mahome what is this diluting the religion she so many diis do this well you came to the wrong dii this is Haram you have to stay steadfast on Islam have red lines you never cross otherwise the religion goes among the external internal external okay alhamd they're awake among the external threats is widening the gap of differences and dispute how is that small issues between us in the family we tend to inflate it enlarge it it's trivial it's silly just give it away no he took my bed we have another bed he took my toy I'll give you five toys he did this he did that this is problematic the wife is also making a fuss of out of nothing the husband is complaining no no no no she did not put enough salt in the food I've had enough you have high blood pressure you put you're gonna die what is this no no no I've told her so many times it doesn't taste good and not only that they introduce the parents the father and the mother and this is the Cardinal sin how when you you stupid husband go to your mom like a child sucking your thumb Mama yesterday she did this she did that she made me sleep on the couch how would your mother feel if she had a shotgun she would shoot her the following day you go home she makes you a good dinner you do some hky Panky and you're so happy with her so pleased you go to your mom mom she's the best woman on earth she's so kind she's so beautiful she's so loving I don't know what I did so Allah grants me this woman does your mom change her mind 10 years she will always remember you did this to my son you made him on November 25th sleep on the couch I'm telling you this out of reality out of experience I know this and I've seen it in so many counseling sessions that I had the biggest problem and threat is when you involve the parents the woman goes and says to her father he did this he did that and if you ask her out of a 100 how would you rate him as a husband she says 99.9 so for this 01 percent mistake you ruin his relationship with your parents this is stupid so again uh one of the threats that threatens are not the biggest huh a little bit small this time is I don't know what they call it in in English because material I have is in Arabic uh what two minutes I don't read English but um trying to limit population among the Muslims so I don't know what they call it birth control yes that's good that's good birth control this is prevailing in the Muslim world and that's why you find Families mallah how many children do you have I have one sheh mallah how long you've been married the 20 years she why so it's good Sheik we you know tried our level best to control the the the quality okay where is your son he's in jail she where is the quality control this is not logical this is not Islamic the prophet saidat to the men he said marry the kind fertile woman she has to be kind because if she she's fertile and she's wild and and and rude nobody marries her and she is kind but she's not fertile the prophet did not recommend this why he said because on the day of judgment I will boast other Messengers with my followers this is why you have to have as many children as you can people say she but you know quality control the quality is not in your hand even if you have one child it's not in your hand the guidance is in Allah's hands no peace be upon him had a son 950 years he's giving da his son died as a cfir does anybody think that no did not do a good job of course not he did the best job but it is in Allah's hand sometimes you could have 50 Children and they all become leaders and diis and imams and someone who you are proud with so don't do that mistake the one before the last is westernization it's a threat we're losing our identity as Malay as Muslims as Arabs we have our identity why because the media is brainwashing us so we tend to think that eating with a fork in the left and the knife in their hand and yeah this is eate we think that doing this and doing that is eate we think that sending our girls abroad alone to study is good is eate education and we've left the religion behind us all of this is Haram westernization is an ideology when you think that what you have is old archaic is not not modern is not good and all that comes from the West is what we should follow and finally among the biggest threats is the social conditions when people build their families on social Concepts so what counts is how much you have in your bank account and as a good husband you're not a good husband until you can provide me with a new car every couple of years and change the furniture every Eid and take us to uh uh Bali every summer and do this and do that and you're not a good wife until you start a job and you start contributing and paying the bills I don't understand how can a man be a real man with all do respect to the men huh who ask their wives to contribute buy one ringot in the house you're not a real man excuse me if you ask your wife to share the rent or the electricity bill or to buy the groceries this month or to pay for the car insurance you're not a real man a real man is the one who takes care of his wife 24 hours seven days a week financially and he is her Rock how many of the husbands is a rock talk to his wife few most of them are small pibbles no rocks this is a problem and not only that the problem is In some cultures it's the opposite men do not pay Dowry men receive so they go to marry the woman gives the family gives him a car they rent they buy him a house they give him money and if they don't do this the in-laws keep on taunting the poor woman y your your your family did not pay us anything pay you for what to buy a monkey this is a husband I'm I'm I'm getting into this is a monkey who wants money so this is all the time we have but there are so many threats this was intended for you to open your eyes and see do I have any of those in my home if yes how can I Rectify and correct it and I pray to Allah that he saves our families and our homes from such things"
