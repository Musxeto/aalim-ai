  "transcript": "me from Sweden uh my question is that uh my my mom asked there's a teacher who she asked to recite Quran for us and make Dua for us and there there's a people in our life who like my mom give a hard time to from to my mom so she wanted someone to recite Quran for us but weirdly the teacher asked us their names and we thought that was Weir and there's a lot of things going on in our home country there fun tell us and Magic so we didn't want to be involved in those things is it normal that people ask uh names those people they uh make the for okay I will answer me from Sweden now she's asking about her mother asking a teacher of Yasmine to recite the Quran for a particular reason most likely someone is sick or the business of her husband is not going as they wish so a lot of the people from the subcontinent especially unfortunately have these um Innovations so they think that there is a wasifa as they call it or they pay an Imam to recite the Quran or to do uh uh something or to say something for them so this by itself is an innovation it it's not permissible so you have to get this out of your uh uh wish list yes mean and tell your mom that this is totally prohibited and in Innovation now what worries yes mean is that this teacher wants a list with the name of the people that want this Quran for so you go to the sister and she says uh you tell her that I'd like you to do wasifa and recite the Quran because I have few of my relatives who are sick or they have problems with their Visa Etc so the teacher says to them okay would you like this to be with fries or without and you would like it to have mayo or not it's like fast food chains so she said I need a list of the people so that when I recite the Quran I can make whatever and she says yes mean is this some kind of black magic it can be and if we think well of such a teacher it's not it's just her other innovations that are piling up where they where she thinks that yes she is entitled to recite Quran on behalf of others not only that she needs to name them so that the reward would get to them uh uh quicker and this is all not from Islam"
