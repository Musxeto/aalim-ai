  "title": "Taraweeh behind an Imam who recites too fast | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sakip says is it permissible to pray taraweeh behind an imam who recites very fast now this again is a problem and it reminds us of the beginning of today's episode the people have lost their compass they are more interested in quantity rather than quality and this is not the best thing to do as per Islam therefore if a person had the choice whether to pray behind an imam who prays fast or to pray home because there isn't any other message around him what to do I would personally direct the brother to pray behind the Imam though the Imam is not doing the right thing or not following the Sunnah and he's definitely wrong yet by praying behind him until he finishes his Torah we would give you the credit of praying the whole night and nothing can beat that if you want do like Ana's go back home and offer a few more records with pondering accompany with an her sure that would be in Charla a win-win situation"
