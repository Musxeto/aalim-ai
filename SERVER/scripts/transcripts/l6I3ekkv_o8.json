  "transcript": "Munira from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, if a person make a vow, like if two person fight, one win, I will fight. Is it obligatory to make this vow? I did not understand your voice because it's not clear, but if I may try to do my best, if a person makes a vow and if he says if my team wins, I will fast or I will give this charity and the team wins, he's obliged to fulfill his vow because it's a vow. He made a condition and he made this hardship upon himself, which Allah did not ask him to do it. He took it upon himself. However, this is something that is mandatory upon the people to fulfill, though it is not recommended to initiate it in the first place. The Prophet said, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, do not take vows upon yourself because a vow does not bring goodness. And it's only something that is used to extract wealth from a stingy person, someone who doesn't give charity. He said, oh, Allah, if you cure my child, I will give a sacrifice of three rams for your sake. And the child is cured, so he slaughters three rams and gives it to the poor. If his child did not become sick, he would never have given anything to charity. And Allah knows best."
