  "transcript": "Gule from Turkey Assalamu Alaikum Wassalamu Alaikum So if one said that the husband is a mahram because a woman cannot marry somebody she's already married to and he said this in class at school and he said this to a non-mahram and also the teacher who's a quite old lady here heard that and his male friend also I think he thinks I mean heard this is this considered talking about religion without knowledge? Of course of course it is it is talking about religion without knowledge and most likely that individual and those who heard them are confused so they think that because my sister-in-law is married my wife's sister she's married and I cannot marry her this means that she's mahram to me logically not knowing that yes but if her husband dies or she's divorced I can marry her if I'm not married to her sister they don't think about this way because if they thought in expanding it every single woman who's married should be mahram to me I can't marry someone who's married so does that make her mahram? Of course not but they're not thinking straight they're confused so this ignorance of theirs has to be explained to them and then they will find out the answer inshallah"
