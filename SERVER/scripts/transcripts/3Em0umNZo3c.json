  "transcript": "Wasim he says can we put rakia water at the corners of our house if there's gin possession or evil eye or black magic done on one of the members of the house the concept of rakia is there and we all agree that it is part of our religion the Prophet said that stated eyes some aerial blue alia Rock'em and he also recommended this he said show me what you recite as rakia and he said whoever is capable of helping and assisting his brother by doing rakia he should do so so the concept is there the rakia is either done by reciting the Quran and the prophetic doors and the doors in general and dry blowing on a person and it can be also done on water you dry blow on water or on the palms of your hands and you wipe over the affected areas about the wood in his sunan reported that the Prophet Isis Salam recited rakia on water and poured it on someone so this the concept is there now the scholars say that there isn't anything to prevent using this water that we've recited rakia upon a bit further so we can drink from it no problem we can wash from it no problem and we can also put it in the corners of the house if we suspect that there are tough jinn who are not willing to leave after reciting the car in the house and it seems that this is insha'Allah permissible"
