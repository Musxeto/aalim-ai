  "transcript": "so we stopped at the prophet s's prayer he prayed and whenever there was the need he would give a reminder he would give a he would give something of importance as in the case of those from the tribes of mud also in one incident for example the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to send his Representatives across Arabia to collect the zakat so we know that zakat is divided into two types hidden and visible what is meant by hidden is your own savings so your cash your gold your silver these are hidden you are responsible for giving zakat on it nobody knows how much I have under my mattress this is mine but the visible zakat is the one that you have visible such as the crops such as the livestock such as stocks for example or businesses that the W the the Muslim ruler can see and he's obliged to go and collect the zakat for the Muslim treasury so the prophet used to send his representatives to different parts of Arabia they go to farm from Farm to farm from life stock uh uh breeder to another and collect the zakat and bring it back to Medina one of them was known [Music] as he came back one day and said to the Prophet alham this is your zakat that I've collected and this was given to me as a gift so the prophet prayed and after prayer he started to give a reminder he says why or how come I employ representatives to go and collect zakat and they come he did not mention the name and this is one of the ways of advising people discreetly but it's a public issue that people have to know the ruling of that's why he had to make it public but they did not know who was intended by this so he said why do I send people to collect zakat and they come to me and say this is yours meaning zakat and this was given to me wouldn't they sit in their father and mother's house and see how many people would give them gifts as a public figure or as a public uh servant if you did not have this job would anyone give you a gift if you were not a medical doctor pharmaceutical companies would they ever give you a ticket to shash or to Dubai to attend a three-day conference in first class ticket in a five star hotel and they give you medicine they give you laptops they give you iPhones and they give you uh expensive watches why they gave you all of this as a bribe because if you did not have this position in that hospital or in that government facility if you're me nobody gives me gifts the poor me because I don't have anything that I can serve you with except of course those who come and they've divorced their wives 15 times and they say she I'd like you to look into into my case and I brought you this gift you know 5,000 KD you can marry her 10 times go ahead I'll give you a stample so this is a clear bribe and those who bribe are cursed by Allah and the prophet said may Allah curse the one who gives bribe and May and and may Allah curse the one who receives the bribe and unfortunately the Muslim world world is notorious and famous for accepting bribes and this is why we have corruption everywhere and if people feared Allah and if we were through practicing Muslims we would not have accepted bribes and everything in our lives would be perfect our buildings would be perfect we would not see any cracks our roads would be perfect the system itself of having paperwork whenever we want to do something it goes smoothly no need for me to make a phone call to someone who knows someone who knows someone no need to put something under the table but unfortunately the Muslim world or the countries that are from the banana countries are used to these uh uh forms of corruption after finishing dhar prayer and whatever reminder he had sallallahu alaihi wasallam went back home to pray the Sunnah of which is two after he finishes his he goes back to the Masjid and sits in the Masjid until time or would go and do things that needs to be done so sometimes he would stay in the Masid from till like when the uh uh tribe of ab came to accept Islam and at the same time they have questions so he sat with them in the Masjid entertained them until it was he prayed ass went home and prayed two R of and the mother of the believer said prophet of Allah you prohibited us from praying after and now you're praying two raas how is that he said well the tribe of came and they sat with me from till and I did not pray mynah so now I am making it up which means that making up missed Sunnah at the time of prohibition is valid what type of sunnas for example the two of if I woke up and it's I made and I went to the Masid to pray with the JAMA after the jam is over it's time of prohibition can I pray my two yes because I've missed it it's a legitimate reason I can pray it at the prohibition time so the prophet between and would stay in the Masjid to serve the Muslims or he would leave the Masjid and go to solve people problems once in Kuba his Masjid is here Kuba is here he left the M after and told B the tribe of they had a dispute and they fought among themselves to the extent that they threw rocks on one another they were fighting and almost rocks after rocks what swords so he went to arbitrate and try to reconcile between them but because it's far he told B may Allah be peace with him if I'm late for ask Abu Bakr to lead the prayer so he deputized Abu Bakr which is an indication that when he dies who would be the Khalifa Abu Bakr also the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam once after when died he went to divide his inheritance because s had only daughters and they were the first daughters to inherit in Islam if we have sons and daughters The Inheritance is easy but if we have only daughters then the daughters would get two3 and the rest would go to the siblings of the deceased if he had siblings if he had a father then it would all be consumed by the father and the so uh and the likes does anyone know ever heard this name he was the one whom the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam made a brother of to ABD Rahman when ABD migrated to Medina the prophet divided the muhajirin the migrants with the people from Medina each one was allocated one to be his brother ABD was one of the richest men but he came to Medina broke so said I'm the richest man in Medina half of my wealth is yours and I have two beautiful wives I'll divorce one of them and you can marry her ABD would have said who okay okay I'm I'm okay for that well freebies are good nobody hates freebies but ABD rman said may Allah bless your wealth and family show me where the market is and he went to the market with nothing and in few months he became one of the richest men in Medina through credit he buys something through credit tells a man I'll pay you tomorrow and he sells it for double the price takes half of it and give the credit back to the man and started to invest invest invest until he became one of the richest men of Medina and of course abdan was one of the 10 heavenbound yeah he was one of the 10 whom the prophet died while he was pleased with so being rich being a multibillionaire does not impact your Iman because this wealth is not in your heart it's in your hand you give it toss it right left and center for the sake of Allah so when was called The Prophet would wait until the people came and he used to pray it at the beginning of the time he would not delay it and the Hadith of anas he says no one was so haste to to pray in the beginning of the time more than the prophet Alat which meant that is like 10 minutes after the aan unlike what thef the Hani school of thought does where they delay the 1 hour after thean and they pray it late this is wrong the the school of thought of Malik of Shafi of Ahmed they all agree that the time of ass is different than the time of the school of Hani school of thought and was different than and F the prophet would not give them reminders after he would not teach them things because this is a limited time between and and people had to go back home to prepare their dinner or had to finish up before it Sunset there are not no lights so if they had work at the farm they had work at the market they have to wrap things up to close for the day so therefore this time the prophet would prayam and not stay in the Masjid rather go to his house and usually he used to like fer visit each and every one of his wives in her home sit for a small while give Salam check up on them and then leave and sometimes you know is very short so in times of winter for example when between and is is very limited he could not accompany nine of them at the same time so what would he do he would go to the woman he's staying the night with and they will all come and visit him in her house and they would gather and uh uh chitchat uh uh during that time this time between and the prophet used to utilize for quality time with the wives so his wives would maybe ask him about things they do not know like the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her when she said oh prophet of Allah was the most difficult time for you the Battle of when you lost your uncle when you lost 70 of your companions he said no the most difficult time was when I was in Mecca and the people of Mecca forced me to go to T so I went to T and displayed myself over the tribes so that they would take me in and give me shelter instead they said you're a liar and they made fun of me and they told their children and their slaves to Stone me so they started stoning me and till my feet started to bleed so I went down from T on foot and I only woke up in an area in between and I did not recognize what was happening I was so depressed I did I don't remember anything walk walking down the road until I saw jiel and the angel of the mountains coming to me jiel said this is the Angel of the mountain Allah sent him to you and the angel of the mountain said oh Muhammad Allah had seen what the people of T and the people of Mecca have done to you if you wish order me and I shall collapse all the mountains on their heads and Destroy them if I was in his place I said take the hell out of them and the people up north and the people up East the whole thing annihilate them but the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam was not like that he said no by Allah I am hopeful and Wishful that Allah will get from their offspring those who hurt me who stoned me I pray that Allah will get from their offspring people who would honor ill and would spread it and would serve it this is the mercy sent to Mankind and sometimes he would entertain ha's questions when ha had a confusion of two conflicting verses and she said how is it possible that people are not held accountable when Allah Asel said that everyone would pass by hell and the prophet explained to her that this passing is not ending entering it and being tortured because some would pass in Hell over the bridge like lightning may Allah make you and me among them so they would not even sense or smell Hellfire on the bridge they just as fast as Lightning and some would be like a tornado very fast and some would be like a person riding a fast horse very fast and some would be running some would be walking some would be tripping and standing and tripping and standing and some would walk and then fall into Hell Fire may Allah protect us and sometimes between and people would invite him so some of the companions would say oh prophet of Allah we slaughtering our camel at this time so can you entertain us and come so the prophet comes and sometimes he brings his wives because slaughtering a c camel is is a nice thing to see and what is more nice is what follows that when you slaughter a camel what will happen e it so the prophet goes and they slaughter the camel and they cook it and they feed the prophet so he used to utilize this time for easy things once the sun sets and the aan is cold he immediately goes to Salat this is the fastest of the day between and there is a very small and short Gap and usually usually is very quick but sometimes the prophet would prolong it so there are narrations that once he prayed and he prayed with that's a very very long Surah and once he prayed M and he used he recited and in another one he recited and this is not not very long but still it's not like it's a little bit long but usually yes was very short and the was very close to Sunset so that when they finished Salat you can still see there's still light you can recognize people and immediately afterwards he would go back to home to pray the two ra of and you notice all the Sun the prophet used to pray where at home and this is the best the more rewarding unless you have some errands like us we're staying here so between and we're saying the Masid so you pray the Sunnah here okay why don't you pray the Sunnah none of your business who's the she I'm a traveler and the Sunnah for a traveler that he skips the of and the prophet never ever prayed M andah when he traveled never so I'm following the Sunnah okay and then after he finishes his two he would sit home and just have supper this is the time of eating and if he was fasting he would order his companions to eat first and then go for prayer the prophet said Alam when food is served begin to eat before you pray M and don't rush take your time time eat so that when you come to pray you come with an attentive mind unfortunately some countries don't do this immediately after aan 5 minutes and and this is wrong if it's time for fasting give 10 15 minutes for people to eat and come to the Masjid relaxed but not to eat for an hour and then all eat sweets and then have some you know espresso afterwards and what are you doing so I'm eating enjoying it's time you've missed M no be moderate eat and and and until you are satisfied and then go for prayer if he's not fasting immediately after M he goes home to eat one of the etiquettes of all companions not only the prophet is to eat with others the prophet saidat Whoever has the food of two in his home should accompany a third meaning while going to eat you have the food for two no you see some poor people come and if you had the food of three accompany a fourth and this is the etiquette in Islam don't don't leave any man behind starvation is not good the norm of the Prophet is he used to accompany sometimes 10 he would select 10 poor people come follow me home and they go home and he asks his wives do you have any food sometimes they say sorry nothing so he says to them I'm sorry we don't have anything and if they have whatever they have he says BM join this was the normar Omar AB they would not eat alone they would invite anyone random not their friends not their relatives or neighbors any poor people they see come and follow me and join me on the food and during eating he would notam remain silent like many people do a lot of the people when they eat they don't speak why they think that this is eate others think that if they speak the food will finish so I'm going to eat as much as I can no the prophet wasam while eating he used to speak he used to teach he used to joke with his companions and this gives food flavor if he finds one of of the children eating with his left he would say oh boy say eat with your right hand and eat from what's in front of you so he teaches and if he's eating with uh others or alone when he finishes what does he do he licks his fingers and this is why Kentucky Fried Chicken say h Finger Licking Good so they took this from the Hadith maybe I don't know maybe I don't know so this is part of Islam unfortunately we are so ashamed of our religion so even when we eat we try to eat with the fork and the knife which is but if there is some food on your fingers what's the problem I love it when I go and eat with the people from the subcontinent they immediately dig in with the fingers there are spoons masallah and everything's normal this is the Sunnah and after you finish you lick it your plate after you finish you lick it come on sh dishwasher this is a why do we do this by the way the prophet said said do this because you don't know where the Baraka is looking for the Baraka you don't know what's your healing what's your health what's your uh uh nutritions is going to be and this is what the prophet is telling you when something falls down pick it up remove the dirt say bmah and eat it the prophet says you don't know where the Baraka is don't leave it for the Shan so all of this yeah beautiful teachings of the Prophet we've abandoned what will the people say go to any restaurant now you see Muslims masallah the fork with the left and they eat with the left what are you doing oh this is the eate cut and then change no no people will laugh who's watching you Mah who are you an influencer everybody's watching to take a picture the hell with everybody else do what the is and seek Allah's pleasure and the prophet while eating he would inject beautiful beautiful love messages while eating he will inject beautiful love messages says whenever the prophet sallai wasallam ate with me if I had a piece of of meat and I took a bite of it he would grab it from my hand and look where I put my teeth and he would eat from it what Woulda feel whenever I drink from a cup the prophet would take it from me and put his lips on the same place where I've placed my lips on and drinks from it this is a sign of love what we do what do we we do with our wives M honey bring me a spoon please she says take my spoon I said okay just wash it seven times and one with soil pleas or please wash it with dto and just what kind of message are you giving some spouses tell their spouses no no I don't eat behind you or after you I have to have clean utensils this is wrong you have to inject love in your life this is a huge deficiency in our love life with our spouses we fail to say I love you we say we fail I say I care for you when I travel here I message my wife you know love messages she returns back say what's wrong what have you done wrong nothing I'm just I'm just trying to any do what I preach okay I send her a you know a red lipstick Emoji she sends me the same Emoji what is this don't you improvise don't you innovate not that everything I do you do the same this is not love this is duplicating we have to do what the prophet used to doat if we would love to have this uh uh beautiful relationship and the prophet would wait in his house between M and he had his meal he had some nice time with his uh wife and guests until it's is time once thean is given he goes to the Masjid and he prays isaa is different because sometimes he used to delay between and until it was the first third of the night yeah not 5 minutes 10 minutes maybe an hour imagine until Omar would come to the prophet's house and knock the door oh prophet of Allah the people are asleep because they've been working since F and the prophet would come out and say mashallah mashallah no one on earth is waiting for prayer other than you and the companions would feel proud of it and the prophet would also say this is the preferred time of it if there was no heart hardship so he would delay it as much as possible so that everybody would come and conclude their day with this beautiful ritual and then go back and disperse how would he pray Isa now imagine the people are what Dead Tired they've been working 10 hours 12 hours in the sun farming plowing the ground or uh carrying things in the market so they're feet they're dead so the prophet would make Isa very light very short and he would not and he would be angry if someone prolongs it in another Hadith mu jabal used to pray with the prophet Alam and go to his tribe because he was a learned man and His companion and a scholar he used to lead prayer for them for him it's voluntary but one day he recited Surah Al bak and the people were whoa come on so one of the companions said too much he retreated completed Isa on his own and left after the prayer was over you know the Good Samaritans as usual went to him hey mu mu do you know what so and so did while you were in the first raak he retreated and finished his raak and left M what is this He's a hypocrite The Good Samaritans went to the man said did you know what M said he said you're a hypocrite these are the gossipers that feued the fire and and fuel it so mu said when the man heard this that mu said he's a hypocrite he said I will show mu who the hypocrite is and went to the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah mu does this and that and we have work to do we're tired we want to go and and sleep so the prophet was Furious and angry and he said mu are you a fatan are you trying to cause FNA no when you lead the prayer you should take it easy because behind you there are the sick there are the elders there are those who have errands to finish so make it short When you pray for yourself prolong the prayer as much as you want and the prophet Sall wasallam after finishing Isa would not give reminders ever rarely if there is a need but usually no he used to hate sleeping between and and he used to hate speaking after is unlike us when is the night yeah when does the night begin after this is the night nice time you guys here sleep early Not Like Us in jida people start their day at 10:00 p.m. unfortunately which is very wrong because then you go to the Masjid nobody's praying faer where is everybody asleep but the prophet used to go to bed usually after is unless there is something of importance so if there is a an important issue to discuss he would stay aftera to discuss it with Abu Bakr and Omar because this is in the interest of the Muslim umah and the country so he would dedicate this time to do this otherwise he would go and sleep and may Allah have mercy on his soul mentioned in his he says the prophet manners was that he was nice to live around nice to be around he was always smiling he was always joyful and playful with his family kind to them try to give them as much provision as possible he would laugh with them they all gather every night with him at the day at at the house of whom he's sleeping uh at and they after they will all go go and disperse to their houses he used to sleep with his wife in one bed under one blanket and he used to take off his garments two pieces like the one we wear for this is called and and he would only wear a waist wrapper and he would uh uh speak with his wives and try to uh chitchat with them until he goes to bed this is his way this was his day and throughout the day whenever he went and walked in the markets he would always put Allah in his mind and preach the religion so if he walks in the market and he sees a pile of food you know uh uh wheat or barley he would insert his hand into it and the outside is dry and the inside he finds it moist and wet and he would say what is this and the man says oh yesterday prophet of Allah it trained so I turned it over so the wet part is inside and the dry part is outside what is this cheating so many of us when they sell their cars what they do what do do they do they wash the engine they put some uh diesel on it they bring some tea and they you wipe the tires so it becomes black they Shine the Chrome and and they sell it as if it's brand new and they know that it has defects something wrong with it but they don't disclose it this is Haram this is cheating you know your car has defects that I cannot detect you must tell me about it you must tell me that the engine has this it was rebuilt it was this and that and also the prophet Alam used to visit those who are sick used to uh uh mourn the dead and give condolences to the family and sallallahu alaihi wasallam would not hesitate to help a widow or an orphan or someone is in need with whatever he can using his reputation using his name using his authority and after is it is time to go to bed and sleeping is a gift from Allah and this is a defect in humans if they don't sleep when they say oh masallah so and so he doesn't sleep this is a defect wrong but it is not a defect at all when it comes to Allah because Allah is the most independent he does not sleep at all because he does not need to sleep he is Allah if he had sleep or doses the whole universe would collapse so subhanahu wa ta'ala never sleeps and the prophet as a human being he used to sleep like humans but the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam did not deal with sleep as a luxury as something nice to do it was a necessity unlike what people do today they deal with sleep as a something of luxury you go to their bedrooms and you find that it costs thousands and thousands of dollars over a bed over the over the furniture what what is this sleep is sleep you just need to re-energize and rest but what you're doing is extravagance the prophet's bedat was of tanned height filled with palm fibers very very basic and his pillow was the same sometimes he pray he slept over a mattress made of straw sometimes he slept on the ground itself so it wasn't a comfortable bed that he would sleep over he would sleep on his right hand side most of the time and this is the Sunnah he ordered Al when you want to sleep perform your W and lie down on your right hand side and say the Dua but it was reported that he used to sometime lie down on his back so there's nothing wrong in lying down on your back what about lying on your left there's no prohibition so there is also permissible so right back left is okay then what's left on the stomach it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion that I follow is that it is permissible IM Al bukari the IM that compiled sah alkari said no Hadith is authentic in prohibiting sleeping on your belly there's no Hadith authentic some Scholars authenticate a Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam came to the Masjid and saw a man sleeping on his belly and the prophet kicked him to wake him up and said that this is how the people of Hell sleep some Scholars authenticate personally I don't think it's authentic because Imam bukari said it's not number two it's illogical the man is asleep and the prophet would never kick someone for doing something unintentionally while asleep yes if you he was awake with his eyes open you would kick him but the guy is asleep how would I control my sleep to know whether I'm sleeping on my side or on my back or on my my my belly so the Hadith is not authentic but it's safe for you not to take it as a habit and sleep to begin with while yeah awake on your stomach just to be safe rather than to be sorry the prophet used to sleep at the beginning of the night and he used to wake up at the end to offer night prayer and did I say someone okay sorry um and sleep was not disconnecting from life like we do when we sleep sleep we're disconnected the prophet's sleep was not like this he slept only to be able to wake up and offer night prayer and the Dua that he had Alat before sleeping was mindblowing it teaches you that the prophet dealt with sleep as a form of worship we go to bed and you ask what did you say before going to bed well I don't remember I just you know phased out power is off okay what about thear what about the Quran Allah I don't see anything I just went and crashed the prophet s wasallam used to say to Al when you want to sleep make wo and put your right hand and and lie on your right and you say he oh Allah I've submitted myself to you I've turned myself to you committed my Affairs to you and sought your refuge for protection out of desire for you and out of fear for you expecting your reward and fearing your punishment there is no refuge and no place of safety from you but with you I believe in the book you have revealed and in the prophet you have sent what is this this this is Dua before going to bed what do we do before going to bed oh check the last Instagram posts oh check my WhatsApp oh check my emails oh check anything the news maybe what happened here and there and then crash the prophet used to have a huge amount ofar he used to say oh Allah in thy name I die and live and he used to say when you go to bed what's the first thing you do before you lie down your your bed you dust it with your garment if you can if you don't have a garment it's you have a a pajama of pages what what are you going to do and take it off no take a pillow take anything and just dust it because you don't know what uh bed bugs or what anything is in there or Shan you're just kicking away and cleaning it and then he used to sayat with your name y i Place my side upon the bed and with your grace I will raise it up if you withhold it then uh uh or and cause it to die have mercy on it and if you release it make me live guard it against which you uh guarded your Pious slaves all of these is just a warming session then he used to cup his hands then blow in them then recite and then wipe his front uh uh area and and part of body repeat this twice repeat this Thrice and this is your protection then after that you sayar of the BET Subhan Allah alhamdulillah Allah abbar 33 times this is 99 and Allah abbar to complete 9 uh the 100 so 33 Subhan Allah 33 uh uh alhamdulillah 34 Allah abbar and the prophet taught this to Fatima and Ali and told them saying this would give you energy more better than a servant in the house and every Muslim says this then he would read Surah tabarak and tabarak protects you from the punishment of the Grave 30 Ayah if you memorize it Surah mul if you recite it every single night it will protect you from the torment of the Grave with the grace of Allah and he used to also recite Surah and he used to also recite and he used to also recite is we're talking about a good half an hour of reciting the Quran before you go to bed I've been snoring since an hour what I can't do this this shows you how connected was the prophet to Allah through Hisar and also he used to say reported by Muslim praise is to Allah who has provided us with food and with drink sufficed us and gave us an abode for how many are there with no provision and no home all of this before going to bed then he would sleep and then he would go to wake up in the middle of the night any by 12:00 by 1:00 he would wake up and then he would say thear of waking up and this is a whole bundle which we've mentioned in Muslim in our last Workshop it's on YouTube you can also watch it and he would pray whatever Allah allows him to pray until B call calls the aan for f and he would go and uh answer the call uh of the aan generally speaking again the prophet's routine was not a routine like we have it was a lifestyle that two minutes okay it was a lifestyle dedicated from the beginning to the end for one purpose is to worship Allah even entertaining himself was with the intention of worshiping Allah even being kind with his wives with the intention of worshiping Allah waking up sleeping eating answering the call of nature reconciling between the factions that were fighting or disputing everything was for the sake of Allah and this is why when mother was asked what was the of the Prophet Alam what were his manners what was his attitude and moral conduct she said don't you read the Quran he said yes he said she said to him his was the Quran everything manifest in his life was coming from the Quran whatever Allah commanded whatever Allah recommended he implemented on the spot whatever Allah prohibited whatever Allah disliked he stayed away from and Allah knows best now I think we will conclude um by this inshallah our Workshop one last point it is obvious through today and yesterday that the prophet's lifeam was radiant transparent Crystal Clear nothing was hidden there wasn't a time in his day that I don't know what the prophet did oh the prophet Sall wasallam left for 6 hours and we don't know what was happening there wasn't anything throughout his life it was an open book unlike any other Prophet or messenger that we don't have data about the prophet everything he did from morning till night time was there documented not that alone even the sound he made when he was asleep yeah his snoring his hissing sound whatever he made when reading the Quran when he breathed this was documented his most intimate moments were documented how he answered the call of nature was documented what does this tell you it tells you that this is the only perfect religion on Earth where we have the teacher the mentor the MU sahu alaihi wasallam life in front of us like an open book nothing is hidden W I said it yesterday and I said it today we know of the Prophet Alat more than we know about our own parents our father and mother we know more of the Prophet then we know about them there are so many things in our parents' lives we don't know our siblings our loved ones our friends but the prophet we know every single thing for"
