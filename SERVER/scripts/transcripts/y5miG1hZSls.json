  "title": "Ep. 6  The Prophetic way of Dealing with Mistakes assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على المبعوث رحمة للعالمين نبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين أما بعد dear brothers and sisters in islam all what we have studied in the past few days were tips of how to deal with those who make mistakes errors or sins and we have not yet gone deep into the way the prophet used to deal with mistakes so among these tips that being careful less correcting one mistakes leads to a bigger mistake and this is known from the rules set by sharia what do we mean by that it is a well-established fact that islam allows the lesser of the two evils in order to repel a greater evil and this is according to the judgment of the day of the scholar so a scholar may keep quiet and he may look the other way about one mistake about one mistake less saying something that leads to a more serious mistake so what's the point in finding someone who's totally wasted intoxicated red eyes playing with his revolver and you want to give him advice knowing that he's going to put a bullet between your eyes doesn't make any sense so in such a situation it would be wiser to refrain and to wait until the time is right now this is not considered to be a form of shortcoming or negligence as long as your intention is to honour islam as long as you're sincere so that you do not fear anyone except allah and it was only concerned for the best interests of islam and this is not a form of cowardice that stopped you from saying anything this is only common sense backed by verses from the quran authentic hadiths from the way of the prophet and this is logical why would you do something just to prove a point and lose many things in exchange some people would even go further and say that you have to say this or do that you have to stand up and speak against a tyrant ruler and say the truth be logical when you give a friday speech to two or three thousand individuals and you do this the ruler is not in front of you to give him advice allah ordered musa and harun peace be upon them to be lenient with pharaoh when they give him advice so that he may remember and you're standing and giving a fiery speech and the guy is not there all what you're doing is provoking the public and this is against the sunnah this is against sharia and there's no benefit of it and what is the result you'll be incarcerated you'll be wasted you'll be gone for 10 20 years or maybe forever and the benefits that you could have given to the public teaching them their religion getting them closer to allah making them know who allah is would have been much much better than this remark that you had made which had no benefit at all so this is part of the wisdom that a lot of the youth let alone the layman and the public among these hooligans must know we've seen what impulsive reactions had done not only to individuals but even to countries devastated by rebellions and demonstrations and protests causing the whole country to collapse causing bloodshed causing a lot of evil and 10 15 years down the line they reflect and look back and say hmm that was a mistake now you know it's a mistake it's a mistake al-hassan al-basri says when the calamity takes place no one sees it except the scholars they are the one who warns against it be careful don't cause chaos among the muslims don't cause bloodshed the hooligans and the layman and the public don't see it once it subsides and goes away everybody can see the results it was too late the destruction had taken place and we can see this in countries around us all over the world people who used to travel who used to have medical care who used to have education who used to live like normal people yes there is oppression there is transgression but they were alive after all this chaos that took place and the calls for liberty and the likes look what happened to them they can't even travel from one neighborhood to the other they can't even eat they cannot travel they're rejected in all countries why because they listened to those who did not have knowledge go to the quran go to the sunnah consult the real scholars and they will tell you they will guide you look at the seerah for example the prophet alayhis salatu wasalam had many hypocrites in medina doing heinous things plotting to destroy islam collaborating with the disbelievers doing their level best stealthily to harm islam and the muslims the prophet knew them alayhis salatu wasalam he could have annihilated them but he didn't why because there was a greater evil that may be caused by that and what is that the prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam in an authentic hadith i will not let people say that muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is killing his own companions the people outside of medina don't know what's happening on the ground do not know the reality of the matters all what they hear is that prophet muhammad alayhis salatu wasalam executed xyz and they were muslims and they were his companions this would cause people to refrain from accepting islam if this is what islam does to his followers i'm not interested and this is why the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam stopped from killing those disbelievers those hypocrites because of the greater evil that may result out of that take another incident the prophet said and the hadith sallallahu alayhi wasallam had your people were not had they not been close to times of ignorance meaning that they've just accepted islam had they been firm in islam and well cemented i would have demolished the kaaba kaaba and built it upon the real foundations of ibrahim and made two doors for it a door where people enter from and a door where they exit from so the reason the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam refrained from such a noble cause was the fear that people may reject islam and rebel against it saying that this is the structure that adam built this is the structure that ibrahim rebuilt peace be upon him and now you come and demolish it and destroy it they would not think of the noble cause and the reason and this is why if you look at the kaaba you will find that it is this area of the building itself the structure and then there's an arc next to it a high arc made of marble where people do not go into the area between the kaaba and this arc they call it hijr ismail and it's originally known al-hatim why because in the past the kaaba was partially demolished due to a flood that came so when they rebuilt it they only invested halal money in rebuilding it and they fell short from completing the whole area so they just built that structure and left the area where we have this arc and this area is the kaaba and that's why we don't go from inside otherwise your tawaf would be invalid that's why we go from outside of it and make a long circle so that we would go around the kaaba not inside the kaaba what the prophet wanted to do alayhis salatu wasalam he wanted to rebuild the kaaba on these foundations the real foundations of ibrahim peace be upon him but the only reason he refrained from doing so fearing that the people would apostatize and leave islam also in the quran this is mentioned in the quran allah says do not curse the idols that they worship hence they would curse allah azza wa jal now cursing the the idols they worship is a good deed because it's false it's fabricated it's bogus it has no value and they're committing shirk by worshipping it so cursing it is a good thing but allah tells us don't do that if cursing it would lead them to retaliate by cursing allah azza wa jal our lord so whenever there are two evils commit the lesser one whenever you want to do something always weigh the consequences don't shoot first then ask questions no ask questions be certain then act and this is an islamic concept that a lot of the muslims are not aware of or they might be aware of but they're so impulsive they want results now let's do this let's do that consult the scholars think of what might happen if you were to do this no no no we have no time we have to act and the hooligans follow and if you try to reason with them and they they would point at you and say oh he's a boot licker and ass kisser just because i'm giving you a sincere advice based on the quran the sunnah no we cannot tolerate this injustice we have to act we have to do what you're doing is against sharia no this is not true sharia supports justice you're not talking with quran and sunnah you are talking with emotions and this is what led the muslim ummah to destruction year after year decade after decade when they neglect what the true real scholars advise them by and they disregard them and they look down upon them and they accuse them with different names and subhanallah history keeps on showing them that the scholars were right and they were wrong but they never learn and this is a problem we may note that what causes a greater evil when rebuking for one mistake is zealousness which is not checked or controlled this uncontrolled enthusiasm this drive that is not harnessed by the quran and the sunnah and by the wisdom of the scholars this is what causes a lot of problems and chaos and greater evil all over the place the following point is also something that we have to pay attention to when correcting people's mistakes and that is making a distinction between mistakes that transgress the limits of islam and mistakes that are done to us as and affect us as individuals so there is a difference between what people do and this impacts islam and what people do and this impacts us as individuals if we consider islam to be more valuable than our own souls then we have to avenge islam and we have to stand by it of course governed by the quran and the sunnah and the wisdom of our real true scholars it is a sign of weakness of iman when one is insulted he's outraged he's angry and he wants to avenge himself while when the prophet is depicted or insulted or the quran is burnt or the religion is degraded and insulted he doesn't have any problem he doesn't have any issues with that this is a true sign of weakness of iman the prophet so often forgave those who made mistakes against him personally but would never ever tolerate a mistake that was related to islam to quran or to sharia especially if these mistakes were from ignorant bedouins nomads they had no knowledge so the prophet would usually forgive them if it was related to him personally anas ibn malik tells us that once he was walking with the prophet and the prophet had a cloak on his body that had a very thick and harsh inside layer especially at the collar's side while they were walking a nomad came from behind the prophet alaihi salatu wasalam grabbing him from his cloak startling him pulling him back to stop him and saying in a very rude fashion oh muhammad give me from the wealth of allah that you have because it's not yours it's allah's wealth the cloak affected and impacted the prophet's neck and shoulder severely and you can see the scratches and the redness on his skin sallallahu alaihi wasalam now this if it happened to any of us we would have probably fought with the man or grappled with him or beat him up but the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasalam who was startled who was physically injured and who was disrespected by being addressed as oh muhammad without saying oh prophet of allah without being polite he did not avenge himself he did not reprimand this man because he knew that it was a mistake and this is the nature of such people he simply smiled and ordered his companions to give him something from the treasury to satisfy him this is what we need in our daily lives even with the closest of people to us with our wives with the children with our relatives with our neighbors with our colleagues we have to always know that such a mistake was directed to us personally and not to islam and hence we shouldn't avenge ourselves if your deeds are for the sake of allah you should not care what people say about you if someone degrades you or insults you or says something that is inappropriate so what move on dogs will keep on barking no matter what they'll never stop so you will be the better person and this causes us to also learn from this hadith that there is a distinction between a major sin and a minor sin the sharia made a difference between them so when someone makes a big huge mistake it's not like when he makes a small mistake don't make it an issue that any mistake has to be corrected and addressed weigh the pros and the cons also you have to make a distinction between someone who frequently makes mistakes and someone who makes a single mistake once every blue moon they can't be treated in the same fashion you have to hand it to the one who seldomly or rarely makes mistakes also someone who has a track record of good deeds and being noble and being one of the dignitaries respected when he makes a single mistake is different than someone who is an open sinner who frequently sins and doesn't care what people say about him someone with a clean reputation can't be treated like someone with a reputation that has been tarnished for years you have to make a distinction you have to differentiate and give this difference to those who are who have earned it and also we have to make a distinction between someone who sins openly and someone who sins secretly someone who does a sin between him and Allah nobody knows about it you have no right to go around and spread the bad news and expose his secret sin because this is between him and Allah you expose him Allah will expose you this is different this is different than someone who is deviant by nature and evil by nature a drug dealer he does it in secret but he sells drugs and he corrupts others this one has to be exposed we may give him advice but if it doesn't work expose him and report him to the police someone who openly sins is different than someone who does sin in secret and is ashamed of it and finally again it is different when you're giving advice or correcting the mistake of an individual who's a normal person and when you're giving advice or correcting a mistake of someone of authority or a ruler such caliber you have to be very careful and you have to follow the rules of engagement as per the sharia that tells you that don't confront them with advice in public and be lenient to them and choose the right time and the right approach because they have different status than anyone else and Allah Azzawajal knows best we have a short break so stay tuned and after the break we will take your phone calls bi-idhnillahi Azzawajal so stay tuned"
