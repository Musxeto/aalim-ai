  "transcript": "Miraj for Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam So I asked you this question yesterday, but I asked that in a wrong way. That's why I wanted to ask it again. My question was, if someone wants to revert back to Islam from apostasy, if he asks forgiveness only for his kufr while still committing other major and minor sins, is his repentance for the kufr invalid because he is still committing other major and minor sins? I answered you, Akhi, and I said to you, his repentance from kufr has nothing to do with his not repenting from the other minor or major sins. These are two different things. The issue was, some scholars say, when a person reverts to Islam, all of his sins are forgiven, including the sins that he did not repent from. And this is not true. All of his sins are forgiven, providing that he quits and stops doing those sins he used to do in Jahiliyyah and not to continue. But if he repents from doing drugs, from fornication, from consuming intoxicants, but he's still vaping, all is going to be forgiven except vaping because he's still doing it. And his Islam is accepted and valid."
