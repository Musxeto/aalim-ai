  "transcript": "You have to abide by the etiquettes of Friday. Shuayb from India. Shuayb? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, we know that if we have backbitten someone, we should go and ask them for forgiveness. But what if we backbitten someone who is a total stranger, such as politicians, neighbours that we can't reach, you know these people are very hard to get to, to get in contact with them. Even if we get in contact with them once in a lifetime, it's very awkward to say that listen, I have backbitten you, so put your face forward, it's very awkward, so what to do in this situation? If you are unable to seek their forgiveness, or know that if you seek their forgiveness a lot more severe hardship would come to you, in this case ask Allah to forgive them and to accept their repentance, and you sincerely repent and show remorse and do good deeds hoping that Allah would forgive you."
