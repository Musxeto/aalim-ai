  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh One of the most beautiful things that makes a person breathless is the remembrance of the Prophet ﷺ and his biography being studied by his father and mother. Ignorance is a lot in us and ignorance is only eliminated by knowledge. In this regard, we aspire to gain something from that knowledge, from the essence of prophecy. Where a person learns the biography of the most beloved creation to Allah Azza Wa Jal. He learns how he was born and when. He learns how his life was before the resurrection. How his marriage to Khadija, the mother of the believers and the leader of the women of the worlds was. She learns how the resurrection was and the talk about the secret period and the call for the secret. Then the public call. Then going to the grave and emigrating to it. The first and second emigration. Then the Prophet ﷺ and his companions were to bear what happened to them of persecution and torture because they, as the Honored One said, and we do not do of them except that they believe in Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy. Then the blessed emigration is learned and what happened in it from the events and events. Then his settlement in Medina and his war against the Jews and the polytheists and the hypocrites in that Islamic state. She learns about Badr, about Uhud. She learns about his siege and his going to the sons of Qaynuqa, the sons of Nadir, the sons of Qurayza and what he did to them. She learns about the battle of Mu'tah, about the trench, about the conquest of Khaibar and about Tabuk. She learns about the year of Wafood. She learns about his addressing the kings and presidents in those times. She learns how the legislation was passed on him. She learns about his wives, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. She learns about his wisdom in his marriage and what is behind that wisdom, benefits and knowledge. If all these things were gathered with the Muslim and tasted the biography of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, his prayer would have been different, his fasting would have been different, and his worship to his Lord, the Exalted in Might, would have been different. The love of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would have increased in his heart. Love, may Allah make him inherit that love, accompanied him in the Gardens of Bliss. This is an important material in our lives before it becomes an important matter in our knowledge. I hope from Allah, the Exalted in Might, and I invite him to benefit me and you with what we say and hear. May Allah be the guardian of that and the one who is able to do it. May Allah's peace and blessings be upon his servant and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad."
