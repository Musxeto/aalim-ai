  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So there's videos that talk about true crime cases. They often don't paint the criminal in a positive light or promote their actions but rather the videos just detail the crime that took place. They give backstories and possible motives and they also sometimes include analysis of the interrogation recordings from the detectives as well as police cam footage of the scene and the arrest so is such content permissible to watch? Such content is a waste of time. You should ask yourself, on the day of judgment or in my grave, when I'm asked about my life, my time, my youth, where it was spent, would this be something positive or negative? Such crimes definitely include music, free mixing, men and women, inappropriate scenes and in addition to the crime itself that probably would give you nightmares, would give you some form of perception that is not beneficial for you as a Muslim. A Muslim values his time and utilizes it to his benefit. So yes, you can watch something that is beneficial but does not include haram and that would be permissible. To watch something that is beneficial while including haram, that would be sinful for you and Allah knows better."
