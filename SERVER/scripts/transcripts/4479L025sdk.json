  "transcript": "Summit from Australia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, I'm a very big air conditioner of yours. Masha Allah, may Allah Azza Wa Jal increase you in coolness. I have three quick questions to ask you if that's okay. One only, one only Aussie man, only one question please. Well since I'm from Australia I have been eating Tim Tams my whole life which is a popular chocolate biscuit brand here and I just recently found out that they contain 0.05% alcohol. So I was wondering if that invalidates all my sellout until now? Okay, first of all good day and second of all no there is no problem with such a negligible 0.05% of alcohol. This has no impact even if you eat the whole box it will not intoxicate you and the scholars all agree that this is negligible and there's no problem in that inshallah."
