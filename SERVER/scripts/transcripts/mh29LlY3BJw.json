  "title": "What are signs that prove a person has no iman? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "can you answer um which are the signs that someone has no iman can you tell me what are the signs that prove a person has no iman sergio this is a genetic question now iman as we've explained before can refer to something that is genetic which the opposite of it is disbelief kuffer so whenever you say what are the signs that a person has no iman i would tell you all the things that nullify islam so one of them is sufficient if a person mocks the quran or allah or the prophet or the rituals of islam makes fun of it he's a kafka no iman if a person deals with sorcery in black magic and worships the jinn and asks them to tell him the future he's a kafir there's no email and the list goes on you can revise series number 8 9 10 11 these four episodes of our book and you will find that we mentioned the things that notifies islam but when you talk about the branches of iman which when one of them is not found it does not invalidate the fully mad rather it reduces it there are many so we know that the prophet says four attributes four characteristics if a person has them all he's a pure hypocrite and if he has one of them he has a branch of hypocrisy and the prophet mentioned us some a number of them even in different hadiths lying breaking your promise um not fulfilling your pledges you can go on so all of these are signs that iman is diminishing it's getting less and less until a person is a full-fledged hypocrite and in this case we say that he has no iman at all and allah azzawajal knows best masuma says i'm your regular listener and your answers satisfy me alhamdulillah but i have a question regarding each"
