  "transcript": "Shayan from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam to Allah How many days off are Imams allowed to have? Come again? How many days off can Imams have? Days off of what? Just from leading the five daily Salah, you know, I don't, maybe like going somewhere to have fun This is up to them An Imam is either being appointed by the board of the Masjid or by the government and he gets paid for that Or he is a freelancer, doesn't get paid for it, he assumes the role of Imamah for the sake of Allah Azza Wa Jal And for the love of the religion Like a lot of the Muslims, a lot of us don't get paid for this Because they have other sources of income, they don't need it, Alhamdulillah So if he is someone that is appointed by the government or by the committee or the board of the Masjid and he gets paid for it We have to look into his contract, if his contract says that you're obliged to give four Khutbah every month of Fridays And one or two classes a week As for the prayer, it's up to you This is what's between him and the committee or the government If he is a volunteer, he does it for the sake of Allah, no one can hold him accountable He can set off whenever he wants and quit the Imamah for a week or two or three without any problem So it is dependent on the contract"
