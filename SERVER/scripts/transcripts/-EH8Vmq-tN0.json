  "transcript": "Ateeb from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh, I do not follow any specific opinion regarding if leaving one single Salah out of laziness is Kufr Akbar or not But in any case, if I miss one Salah, do I just resume my prayers or do I do a specific type of Tawbah? I mean, I know that we should have regret, determination to not repeat the sin of leaving Salah But what do I exactly verbally say? How exactly do I do Tawbah for leaving Salah in this specific case? I want to know two things. What exactly to say verbally to repent when I don't follow any opinion? And two, what all actions of the Qalb are required? First of all, there is nothing to be said verbally You've abandoned a prayer without a legitimate reason and this amounts to a very major sin, one of the major sins in Islam In order to repent, you have to have remorse filling your heart You have to ask Allah for forgiveness You have to not do this again You have to intend not to skip a prayer again and resume doing good deeds and Allah knows best"
