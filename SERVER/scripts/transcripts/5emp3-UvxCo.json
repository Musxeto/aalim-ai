  "transcript": "madiha says i had my breakfast while i was fasting voluntary fast nephilim after two hours i remember my fast i continued fasting thereafter is my fast valid or i need to make it up again the prophet says whoever eats or drinks while fasting out of forgetfulness allah has given him food and drink what does that mean it means that this is a gift from allah to anyone who is fasting and eats or drinks out of forgetfulness yet this does not mean if i see someone fasting and he's drinking or eating it doesn't mean that i should leave him alone because allah is feeding him and providing him with the drinks no i have to enjoy virtue and righteousness and forbid evil and vice by telling him you are fasting so that he would refrain therefore um this is not affecting your fasting this is totally okay insha allah"
