  "title": "Imam is very fast going to Ruku & says Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah after he rises up, is prayer behind",
  "transcript": "thank you from the U.S yes I pray the amount um he's very fast when it comes to going for a pool and rising up and when you know when he rises up after he reaches the position of uh then he says and then he goes down and we are still Rising it he's a slab behind him valid the Salat is valid because saying when he's erect is wrong but this does not impact the validity of the Salat it's still valid insha Allah now his speed is questionable if his speed does not allow you to say subhanallah or subhanallah once in or in sujud in this case the prayer behind him is not valid and you should look for someone else to pray behind or if there is no one else then you should pray in your home and collect as many of your a woman folk or even men to pray with you in congregation but you have to ask those around you whether what you are assuming is correct or maybe it's only your own uh whims and desires maybe the guy's prayer is normal so I hope this answers your question [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
