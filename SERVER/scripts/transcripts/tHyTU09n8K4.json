  "title": "Can we use river water for Wudu? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Maji Ben I think this is how the name is pronounced what about using river water for doing Google because many ignorant people urinate in the river throw waste material of humans and animals the answer was mentioned in the beginning but probably you did not join us in the beginning if the amount of water is great and huge or if the water is running like in the case of river it's renewable so even if the whole village urinates in it that would not impact the purity of the water and you can still perform Google from it"
