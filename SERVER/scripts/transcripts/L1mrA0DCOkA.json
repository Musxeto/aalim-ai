  "transcript": "right again next question is it possible to make Heaven if you don't believe nor you you don't you never hate Islam if you believe your way of life is religion itself you're kind you're good you're nice to people you don't do wrong things you don't hurt people but you don't have a specific religion how will Allah judge you this is a kaffir there's no no dispute in that the prophet said Allah in an authentic Hadith he who hears about me and does not follow me he will be in Hell forever and would not be admitted to Jannah so no matter how nice you are how kind how polite how generous to the poor if you don't believe in Quran if you don't believe in prayers if you don't believe in the Sharia and implement it you're doomed to hell it doesn't matter how good you are to the people if you're not good to your creator and without submitting your will to Allah you have the arrogance that Satan had Satan was among the ranks of the Angels when Allah created Adam he told them all to prostrate they all prostrated except Satan so Allah says Satan why didn't you prostrate to what I had created with my own two hands Satan said I'm better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay so he was arrogant he did not submit his will to Allah and the result was that he's thrown in hell to Eternity and every single person who shares the same conviction and belief would share the same fate"
