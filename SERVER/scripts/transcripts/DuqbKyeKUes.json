  "title": "Sinful if I enjoy a Holiday with my family if the women in my family do not abide by Hijab?",
  "transcript": "Adam from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. I know a family that is going on holiday to Muslim lands. However, the hijab is not properly observed and the son does not want to go but he is dependent upon them. They insist on him going and maybe badly shout at him. Would he be sinful if he goes and actually enjoys his time and wears a thawb since he cannot normally do so? Since he feels like this would be a sisting instance, having enjoyed his time, so would he be sinful? Adam, are they abiding by the hijab in their own country? No. So what's the difference? Nothing. So there's no problem in him going with them with a positive attitude, trying to let them feel close to him, bond with them, let them see his respect to them, and at the same time hit two birds with one stone. Show them how a Muslim should behave, how to give da'wah directly or indirectly in a very diplomatic way, and try to, little by little, influence them to see where he's coming from, why is he doing what he's doing, instead of always being the religious police. No, this is haram. You should cover your hair. You should do this. Don't speak like that. Don't stand in this fashion. Don't eat with your left. Don't drink with this. Don't do that. This is all what they see from you. So you, being in their shoes, how would you react when someone comes to you like this? The difference between you and them is that Allah has thrown the light of Iman in your heart. So if I were to come to you and speak to you rudely about something that you should do, backed by Qur'an or Sunnah, you would be offended because of my rude behavior, but you would accept it, because you have Iman in your heart. So you would take it on board and you would do it. Now, with them it's different. Even if you show them the Qur'an or the authentic Sunnah, they will not accept it because they don't have this Iman in their heart yet. So you would be ploughing in rocks and stones. Nothing would ever grow up from there. You need to cultivate the land first. And you do this by making them respect you, love you, trust you, think that you want upon what Simon says. I don't know, maybe this makes sense inshaAllah."
