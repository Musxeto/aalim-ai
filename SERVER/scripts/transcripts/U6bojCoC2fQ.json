  "transcript": "We have brother Abdurrahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh we often times when we go into Salah and Jama'ah I hear some people like after the Iqamah say some type of Zikr or Dua like like when the imam finishes the Iqamah they'll say La ilaha illallah or something like that or something along those lines Is that an innovation or is there any proof in the Sunnah for doing such a thing? Some of it is innovation, some of it is based on a weak Hadith that is not authentic and some of it is part of what the people just improvise and unfortunately this is how Shaytan behaves and ignorant people don't like to learn Islam from authentic sources so for example when the Iqamah is done Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Ash hadu wa la ilaha illallah Ash hadu wa la ilaha illallah Ash hadu wa la ilaha illallah Ash hadu wa la ilaha illallah Ash hadu wa la ilaha illallah Hayya ala al salati hayya ala al falah Qada qamat al salat wa qada qamat al salah You hear everybody say Aqamahallahu wa adamah Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar La ilaha illallah and everybody says La ilaha illallah Naumu salli ala Muhammad wa ala al Muhammad and say the dua of the Adhan which is an issue of dispute but the most authentic is you don't say it and when the Imam says istawoo they say istawayna i'tadiloo i'tadalna What is this? Is this poetry? Is this rap? Competition? What are you doing? And when the Imam says Allahu Akbar the people say Azzawajal Come on this is too much Now you're taking me off balance totally Where are you getting this from? And they argue back This is dhikr This is praising Allah What's wrong in that? And then when the Imam starts to recite the Quran the people they do this Fata'alallahu almalikul haqq They do this whenever the Imam recites La ilaha illallah They do this What are you doing? Shahada Where are you getting this from? I get people when I was the past three weeks in Malaysia People come to me and they would like to have a selfie Okay So they come and everybody is doing this I said what is this? He said this is Shahada Who said that you have to do this when you're taking a selfie? And who said that this is for Shahada? This is I don't know And one brother came and he did this So when he did this I did this In the selfie He said Sheikh what are you doing? He said you did this I did this So what is the point? This is crazy And people keep innovating Doing Bid'ah Masjids all over the world After Fajr Doing the Adhkar Goes and makes Sujood Whoa What are you doing? He said oh Sujood is Shukr Every day? He said yeah Allah blesses me every day Okay this is a clear cut Bid'ah Big time He said no Sheikh you're extremist I'm extremist The Prophet never done such a thing Companions had never done such a thing Yeah but it's good So you know more than all of them So coming back to your question Ya Abdurrahman Ignore these ignorant imbeciles Don't follow them They don't have a clue what they're doing And unfortunately the vast majority If you don't have proper knowledge and diplomacy To know how to tackle them They would ridicule you when you speak to them Give it a shot And tell them Can I have the authentic Hadith Supporting what you're doing Once they know they can't If Allah guides them They will acknowledge that this is a Bid'ah And Allah knows best"
