  "transcript": "Muhammad from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu One of the young brothers who suffers from the OCD phenomenon where they don't know if they have invalidated their Islam because of something they did or something they said or something they thought about or maybe their intentions about some things. Basically so this guy, he repeats the testimony, he takes the ghusl, he says things are better now because he ignores many bad thoughts and he learned about the barriers of tafseer to apply them to himself to realize that he didn't become a kafir. Basically he says he knows of the opinions relating to the hadith of Qais and the mamah but he says he saw a website claim that there was a narration of the hadith of the mamah in the musnad of Ahmed which he didn't verify. Basically where the mamah also prayed two units of prayer in that hadith. Basically he wanted to know if any scholars have the opinion of the ghusl being an obligation for reverts and apostates because it is needed to remove a state of ritual impurity which occurred due to his disbelief or what he thinks is disbelief and not sexual impurity because that's the reason he takes the ghusl because he fears. I understand your question Mohammed. First of all such people must not jump to conclusions and base their own opinions over things that they've read and act upon that. Such a layman should not do this. Such a person with obsessive compulsive disorder of kufr and shirk and repeating the shahada should not be endorsed to do these things. Rather he must be stopped. So before we verify the concept of is it mandatory or not, is it for uplifting major ritual impurity or not, we say to him, you have to fix your OCD and you have to have counselling. Once we manage to do this we go back. The most authentic opinion is that such a ritual or major ritual impurity to be uplifted by ghusl is not an obligation is not mandatory because it's a ritual impurity. So when a person becomes a Muslim we don't tell him to perform ghusl because he had intimacy yesterday or this or that because this is purifying himself. But is it mandatory? It's an issue of dispute. I'm inclined to say that it is not. Because only one hadith or two maybe in the whole of the sunnah where the prophet recommended it. While the thousands and thousands of people who accepted Islam were not ordered to do this and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
