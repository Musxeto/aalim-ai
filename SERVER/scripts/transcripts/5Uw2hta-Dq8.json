  "transcript": "working in a nursery which is a place designed and made to take in the elders who've been abandoned by their children and this is shameful with the grace of Allah Azza WA JAL the Muslims don't have this and if they do it's on a very very limited scale because the Muslims pay great value to their parents and to their grandparents and it's an honor for them that they fight the siblings fight over whom to take care of his parents when they grow old so generally speaking Muslim world we don't have such nurseries because it's a disgrace and it's shameful for a Muslim to have his parents thrown in such places secondly what is the ruling on serving the opposite gender Islamic Lee speaking this is not permissible it is not permissible for a woman whether she is a a caretaker or a nurse to serve the opposite gender and it's not permissible for a man to take care of an elderly woman by washing her by taking care in her clothes etc this has to be segregated now in non-muslim countries this might be difficult if not impossible and this is problematic so what is the advice the advice is for the sisters not to work in such places unless they make it a condition that they would treat females only but if there were no males to take care of the males and the sisters job like in nurses for example in hospitals a nurse a female nurse is like 9 to 1 male nurse so the male nurse cannot attend all the male patients so what to do I'm not talking about Islamic countries Islamic countries by default it is their obligation to secure such jobs and to ensure such segregation usually because no man a Muslim man would allow a man another stranger nurse or a doctor to come and look at his wife freely and change her bathe her to do etc and no Muslim man would allow a strange woman to come and do this for him it's totally against our system and our religion and our effects but we're not talking about a Muslim country were talking about a nun Muslim country so if this sister works in such a nursery she is allowed to serve men in such a fashion to take care of them especially if they're senile and they've lost it they don't have their conscious on them providing that she minimize the trouble as much as possible how is that done by ensuring that she doesn't touch their agura directly she has to always be wearing gloves and she try her level best not to be alone or not to keep the door closed as for serving her on food this is totally prohibited so if they demand pork or some wine with their food this is totally prohibited for a Muslim male or female to carry or to serve or to collaborate with them in such a sin and it is best for them to look for a better decent job that does not go against our religion"
