  "transcript": "Sujian from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum So I'm working as a podcast manager where my job is to reply to emails of guests on the podcast and also invite founders and CEOs as guests to the podcast and sometimes these guests are women who don't cover their hair and themselves and then these podcasts are recorded as videos. So am I sinful for inviting or replying to these women to appear on the podcast and is my income haram? Jazakallahu Khairan Wa Jazakum In Surah Al-Ma'idah chapter 5 in the second ayah of the surah Allah says and collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon vice and evil. So when you invite on this podcast which is videoed women who do not abide by the hijab what are you collaborating upon? Definitely vice and evil and sins and hence this is totally prohibited and not permissible and Allah knows best."
