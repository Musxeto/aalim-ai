  "title": "Can women wear Backpacks? ðŸŽ’ assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh faizan from india sheikh my question was is it permissible for sisters to wear backpacks for school which would expose the shape of shoulders but beneath a very loose and that is up to the knees so that it would conceal the shape of the shoulders i believe that this is inappropriate for a sister who wears the hijab i would not allow my own wife to do that because once she puts it on it shapes her shoulders her back maybe even her waist and maybe tightens the abaya so that her chest would also be apparent more than if she did not wear the backpack if she wants to wear it she can wear it underneath the abaya put the abba on top no one can see the difference except this hump on the back but nothing else but to wear it on top of the abaya this is totally inappropriate and allah knows best you"
