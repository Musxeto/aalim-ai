  "transcript": "Hamid from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam My question is My question is, is it mandatory to cover our container of water during the night and day because of the hadith narrated from Jabir Ibn Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him that peace and blessings of Allah be upon him said when the wings of the night spread or when evening comes keep your children in for devils come out at that time then when part of the night has passed let them go and close the doors and mention the name of Allah for the shaytan does not open a closed door and tie up your water skins and mention the name of Allah and cover your vessels and mention the name of Allah even if you only put something over them and extinguish your lamps and also because of the wizard the default is any instruction or order from the prophet is to be taken literally as mandatory this is a default unless there's another piece of evidence that that lowers it from mandatory into highly recommended so the hadith among other hadiths where the prophet said when it's nightfall do not leave your vessels uncovered even if you put something as thin as a miswak on it because there's a night in the whole year where an illness descends and would enter any such vessels so the scholar said that this is highly recommended and some say it's mandatory and i'm inclined to say that it is mandatory because the prophet order it some scholars say if it's not a logical obligation then it is highly recommended parts of the adab but i'm inclined to follow what is safe rather than being sorry so yes you have to put something even if it is as thin as a miswak on your vessel or utensils or your glass or your pot now the question is not this the question is if i have a glass of water next to me to me and i forgot and i woke up in the middle of the night should i drink from it or spill it out the answer is no you can't drink from it and you're not sinful for that and allah knows best"
