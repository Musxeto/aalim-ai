  "transcript": "Nosheen from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is next week I am going to travel In Sha Allah So should I pray 2 rakats or 4 rakats of Isha prayer when combining it with Maghrib prayer? A traveler has the concession from Allah Azza Wa Jal to shorten 4 rakat prayers such as Dhuhr, Asr or Isha and Isha from 4 rakat to 2. Fajr remains as it is, Maghrib remains as it is. So shortening the prayer is mentioned in the Qur'an and it's a concession from Allah Azza Wa Jal for those traveling. They have no problem in doing this as long as they carry the name traveler as long as they're out of their outskirts of or the borders of their own hometown. Should they combine? This is permissible. Is it part of the Sunnah? No. It is to be done when needed. It's best to be prayed on time. How to combine? You have 2 sets. Set number 1, Dhuhr and Asr. Set number 2, Maghrib and Isha. The first set can be intermixed. So you can pray Dhuhr on time and afterwards pray Asr ahead of its time at the time of Dhuhr or delay your Dhuhr until it's Asr time Pray your Dhuhr 2 rak'ahs and then combine after you offer Salam the 2 rak'ahs of Asr. And the same thing is done with Maghrib. After sunset you may pray Maghrib 3 rak'ahs and then after Salam you may offer Iqama and pray 2 rak'ahs of Isha or delay the Maghrib and not pray it until it's 9 or 10 o'clock at night then you pray Maghrib 3 rak'ahs then after the Salam you pray 2 rak'ahs of Isha. And this is the gift and the concession of Allah to you and Allah knows best."
