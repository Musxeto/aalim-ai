  "title": "The Meeting With Allah When Allah Shows Us Mercy or Holds Us Accountable",
  "transcript": "Imad from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. I was wondering about the accountability of the Day of Judgment that the Prophet ﷺ told us about, that Allah Azza Wa Jal shows us our sins, and He looks the other way, and the other type that man nuqishal azhab halak. So I'm wondering how we can not be of the other type. The same question was posed to the Prophet ﷺ, and he said man nuqishal hisab azhib or halak, meaning that whoever is questioned about every single detail, then he's doomed. What you're referring to is the placement or the display where Allah Azza Wa Jal places his sitr, and covers an individual from all other people, so they don't see him. And Allah shows him his deeds in general, not in specific. And when the person feels that he's doomed, he acknowledges and says yes I've done this, and he knows that Allah will throw him in hell. Here is when Allah Azza Wa Jal reveals to that person his mercy, and he says I have concealed them for you on earth, and I shall forgive them for you here in the day of judgment. Here is when that individual becomes greedy, and he says oh Allah there are many many other sins, much more than this that I don't see in my on my record book. And this is when Allah laughs subhanahu wa ta'ala, and he forgives his sins and puts him to paradise. This is different than when Allah wants to hold someone accountable for each and every individual item he had done throughout his life. On day so and so, at the hour of so and so, you did this. On day so and so, you did that. This is when that individual is doomed, because Allah does not question and hold someone into interrogation like this, except wanting to put him and place him in hell. And Allah knows best."
