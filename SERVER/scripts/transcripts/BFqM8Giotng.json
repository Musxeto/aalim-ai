  "title": "Can we raise hands & say Ameen after Imam recites Qunoot in Witr? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "A man from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh I want to ask the ruling on raising hands in liturgy of the Imam, start saying Qunoot Allahumma deeni bi mahabait till end only and not the Qunoot Nazila. Also should we say Ameen after him and should there be any gap between the hands or not? So are you asking me about the ruling of saying Ameen after the Qunoot Nazila? Aman? Okay. Yes. Are you asking this? Is this your question? What's the ruling on saying Ameen after the Qunoot Nazila? Not that but also the raising the hands first. It is permissible to raise the hands when the Imam is doing Qunoot whether in Witr or in Qunoot Nazila and to say Ameen as well. The difference is in Qunoot Nazila we don't say Allahumma deeni fee man hadaitu wa aafini fee man aafait. This is for Witr. Qunoot Nazila we praise Allah, we offer salutation upon the Prophet and we ask for the destruction of the Jews and the enemies of Islam and the likes and that Allah avenges the Muslims and the victims that are being oppressed and Allah knows best."
