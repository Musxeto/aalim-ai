  "transcript": "Gule from Turkey Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Yes, so here many times in the Juma Khutba, the Imam says Allahumma Salli Ala Sayyidina Wa Sanadana Wa Mawlana Muhammad What is the ruling and does anyone, does one who is in the Masjid has to say something to this Imam after the Khutba? This is inappropriate to call the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam to be Sanaduna and as Mawlana and Sayyiduna he is Sallallahu Alaihi Wa Alaihi Wasallam But this does not invalidate your Khutba and living in Turkey with all this innovation and their traditions and customs that is totally out of the concept of Islam has nothing to relate to Islam Unfortunately, rarely you will find Muslims, scholars, students of knowledge who abide by the Qur'an and the Sunnah On the contrary, the trend is that they have this hostility against Qur'an and Sunnah They are devout Hanafi blind followers with the Ash'ari and Maturidi Aqeedah prevailing and anything that relates to Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah or to the Sunnah or to the Hadith they oppose it and try to undermine it because it undermines their authority over the people unfortunately and this is very sad It's a beautiful country, the people are beautiful and kind but they need to be guided to Qur'an and to Sunnah not to follow me or him or them to follow Allah's words and the Sunnah of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam Simply by opposing the Hadith or the question Do you love Allah and the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam? Oh yes we love, ok why don't you follow them? Why do you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? I'm presenting you Qur'an, I'm presenting you Sunnah Why don't you follow this? Here is the fork of the road where people have huge dispute and problems I'm presenting you Qur'an, I'm presenting you Sunnah Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry? Why don't you follow Tom, Dick and Harry?"
