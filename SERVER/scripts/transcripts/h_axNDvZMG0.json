  "transcript": "acet says is it prohibited to reply to salam while friday sermon is given the scholars say that the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam where he says whoever says to his brother meaning the person the worshipper sitting next to you Shh saw and he do not speak then he has committed lahu he has committed an act that would discredit his attendance to the hata and would waiver his reward away scholars said when commenting on this hadith that it is not permissible for a Muslim to reply to a Salam so while you're listening to the sermon a man comes and says Salam aleikum wa rahmatullah it is not permissible for you to say radhika salam wa rahmatullah you have to remain silent if someone sneezes and says alhamdulillah you must not say your hamako mullah and all of this is not part of the permissible things to do because it would be considered speaking if someone is sitting for example leaning on his left palm so he's doing this behind his back this is the way that the Jews sit as the Prophet said Alice or Salam you are not allowed to say this is not permissible because this is communication you may say that or you should say that after Salah is over or when the sermon is over at least but not during which so what about if the Imam while speaking he says and the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said shall we offer salutation dancer yes offers a location but do not make it audible you don't say loud you just simply say it by moving your tongue and lips by saying for example that's that is sufficient and a large hotel knows best"
