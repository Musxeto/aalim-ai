  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from Oman Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Salamu Alaikum May Allah forgive me if I have forgotten something about you behind. Sheikh, the question is a woman who was actually jovial with some other male friends before but now Alhamdulillah she has started practicing Islam and she disconnected relationships with other male friend but recently she got a message that her male best friend's mom passed away whom she was also known with and should she now start you know talking with the male friend consoling him? JazakAllah Sheikh. And then what? Go for a date? What is this question Sumaiyah? Of course not! Someone who was in haram relationship and he repented or she repented for the sake of Allah Azza Wa Jal and that partner had a tragedy in his life. His mom passed away, he lost his job, whatever. What are the legitimate Islamic reasons a person can present to re-establish and rekindle the relationship? Oh I'd like to give my condolences. Why? Because his mother died. Okay the mother of XYZ in China also died, why don't you call them? They were not my best friend. Oh, meaning you were not in a haram relationship with. So what would you expect the answer would be? Imagine if you're married with children and he calls or visits or drops by your house to give you congratulations and to meet your husband. How would you feel? How would your husband feel? Come on, this is logical, this is totally prohibited and totally out of the question. As for the dua, may Allah forgive me if I have spoken behind you, against you and people are expecting me to say ameen. No I don't say ameen. Oh Sheikh, you're unforgiving. No that's a movie, it's not me. Then why aren't you saying ameen and being kind? I don't hold a grudge against people. You speak against me or behind my back or make videos warning people from deviant Sheikh Asim. This is up to you. This is backbiting that Allah will judge. For me, I have no beef with you. But on the day of judgement, you'll pay and before that in your grave, you'll pay. I would not give you a cheque blanc or a pass for those who backbite me and say oh forgive me for this major sin I did and I said go ahead. No, this is something that Allah prohibited. Allah wants to forgive you, good for you. As for me, I always keep it blunt and simple. You do something like that, you're going to pay for it. If Allah knows that you've repented and you sought Allah's forgiveness and you rectified such a sin and a felony against a brother Muslim, that's good for you between you and him. As for my side, no thanks. Thanks for coming but I don't have this inclination to say yes ameen, may Allah forgive you, whatever you have done against me, may Allah forgive you. Nope, that's not me. Sorry."
