  "title": "OK to ask others to say Allah humma barik？assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Such things and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best. Now in this hadith we see that the Prophet ﷺ rebuked Amr and was really angry with him, telling him why would anyone kill his own brother just to highlight the severity and the true gravity of what he had done, the mistake he had done. And this is why so many times we are in gatherings and people may compliment something you have. There is no problem in saying to them, Akhi say Allahumma Barik, to block his evil eye. Some people are offended and they have no right to be offended and if they're offended, who cares? Say it to their face so that they would block their evil eye before, they're not offended but I am hurt because of that. Usually if one observes his morning and evening adhkar, the adhkar after the fourth prayer, the adhkar before going to bed and the adhkar before leaving the home, usually with the grace of Allah he's protected. But nevertheless one must take the means. So sometimes when people do such mistakes, it is permissible to be harsh in rebuking them so that they won't repeat that again."
