  "transcript": "Muhammad from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu My question is a bit different. So I have a cat in my house and it has tapeworm coming out of its backside. And sometimes I take the cat on my lap and I pet it, but I'm afraid if the tapeworm get on my clothes or my hand, is it najis? What is? Tapeworm, tapeworm. What's that? It's like worm, worm coming out of cat's backside. Audhu Billah. And you see these worms and you still keep the cat with you? I'm going to treat the cat with medicine soon. And meanwhile you see worms flying around and crawling all over the place and it's okay? No, it's not all over the place. It's only on the cat's backside and then I clean it like immediately as I see it. If these worms are coming out of the anus of the cat, this is najis without any doubt. So you have to purify it if you see it on your clothes. And this is not hygienic at all. This is not healthy man. So many people died because of their cats. Either through infection or through respiratory illnesses. So you better take a look at that. May Allah make it easy for both of us."
