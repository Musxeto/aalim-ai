  "title": "We will surely make them taste the torment of this world Ayah, what about those who repented [32:21]",
  "transcript": "Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu The question is Sheikh, in the words where Allah says that we will surely make them taste the torment of this world before we make them taste the great adornment. So this verse, you said it was applicable only for these believers. So what about the Muslim people who are sinners and who get punished in this world? What if they repent after that? Would they still face the major punishment Sheikh? This ayah, It refers as the scholars say to the torment of the grave. And as we know the torment of a grave is for all Muslims and non-Muslims. Those who repent to Allah Azza Wa Jal and ask His forgiveness before they die, Allah will forgive them. Those who accept Islam before they die, Allah will forgive their disbelief and kufr and hypocrisy and everything that they had committed before repenting. So this particular ayah, the scholars say is one of a number of ayahs relating to the torment of the grave which Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah believe in, unlike the Mu'tazila and the Khawarij and the likes and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
