  "title": "If a woman had a bad experience with divorce & does not want to marry again, is she sinful?",
  "transcript": "okay shireen from pakistan she has a question if a woman got married once and she had bad experience and got divorced she's a jubilee independent lady and don't want to marry in the future and could afford her basic needs is this okay we've answered this so many times and said that getting married is not mandatory it depends on the person's needs and requirements so if a person does not have a desire to be intimate and they don't fear upon themselves fitna and they know that they would be tempted a lot to do sins or not to be dutiful with their partner if they were to marry so they weigh the pros and cons and say that staying single is better this is not prohibited however the natural thing the normal thing is for them to get married what they're feeling at the moment might be due to depression after the divorce or separation might be for their need to be independent and to have their own income might be for many reasons but this is not what's going to happen most likely and therefore they should try to follow the sunnah and the sunnah encourage them to get married a previous experience does should not tarnish your take on marriages for everybody one or two or three bad experiences are only a test from allah not something that allows you to paint everybody with the same brush to answer your question no you're not sinful unless there is a need for marriage such as a a wild sex drive someone who's tempted easily someone who's prone to fall into sin in this case yes it's mandatory for them to get married other than that it is highly recommended and allah azza knows best you"
