  "transcript": "from the netherlands are we allowed to vote in a democratic country where there are groups are we allowed to what um are we allowed to vote in a democrat democratic country where there are groups i will answer inshallah from the netherlands he said can we vote in a democratic country voting is not islamic so it's not permissible for muslims to vote unless they are in a situation where their voice where their vote would make a difference between selecting the lesser of two evils so if we have a muslim who's trying to promote some part of sharia or who would endorse the affairs of the muslims against someone who is anti-islamic and if we say in that country we're not going to vote there's a probability that the anti-islamist would win no you have to it's it's almost mandatory for you to vote though you hate voting and the process because it's totally against islam but it is like amputating part of your body to save the whole body this is something that is done to reduce and the evil and to choose the lesser of the two evils and allah knows best you"
