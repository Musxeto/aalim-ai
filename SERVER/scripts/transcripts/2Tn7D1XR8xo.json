  "transcript": "Adab is a general word that deals with your moral conduct, how you behave, how you think, how you act in Islamic terminology. In Arabic, we say, he has little adab, meaning that he is impolite. Qaleelul adab. In Arabic, this is an insult. He is impolite. And the word adab has a general Arabic meaning that includes literature, poetry, writing of articles. All of this is included in al-adab. However, the book that we have at hand, which is, not this one definitely. This one, Bukhari initially did not call it al-adab al-mufrad. Usually when I speak on stage, I like to make the cameraman's life difficult. So I move from one place to the other, so I guarantee that he gets his money's worth. Yeah, his life is difficult. Life is difficult. I can afford this, I'm the Shaykh. So, coming back, he called it, juz al-adab. Those who came afterwards, added the word al-mufrad, so that they can distinguish it from other words."
