  "transcript": "consider subscribing um [Music] zahib from pakistan okay sheikh my question is regarding that i have a one and a half year old baby daughter and she of course wears diapers and we use good quality diapers not the cheap ones but sometimes when she urinates more than once it gets leaked out her trousers gets bred and of course when that happens then if she's sitting on my lap i change my clothes and if she's sitting on our bed we change the bed sheet because sometimes the bed sheet also gets wet but sometimes it happens that her trouser gets wet but the bed she does not get wet it remains dry and my wife says that it is difficult for her to change it every time so it must be okay because it is still dry so do we have to change our clothes and the bed sheet it fits it is right what counts is what you see not what you think so if the girl clothes are wet the diaper is leaking and you place the child on the bed sheet and you lift it up and there is no wetness no traces of urine or impurity the default is that it is still pure likewise my clothes if there are no traces of impurity that i can see with my own eyes or feel then it does not exist and you have to move on you"
