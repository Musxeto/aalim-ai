  "title": "Is it sinful to shorten prayer to meet someone or complete pending work? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We have Farhan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh, I had a question. If someone is thinking about some person or some work to do, all of the time intentionally in his salah, and he shortens his salah to meet the person or to do the work which he is spending, and he sees that the person who he is thinking about is, you know, a distance, distant himself from him, and he is losing the work and the concentration which is required to do the work, and all of his works are getting ruined. Is this a sign of Allah that he has to be more steadfast in his salah? He should be steadfast in his what? In his prayer. In his salah. So he was doing what he was doing in his salah to impress the other person? No, no. The other person doesn't know about this. Only he himself knows about it. No, as long as he is perfecting his salah for the sake of Allah Azza Wa Jal, but at the same time hoping and wishing that this person would look at him or identify him or build up a relation with him or befriends him, but at the same time his prayer is totally segregated and separate from him. Nobody is watching him. There's no problem in his salah, inshaAllah."
