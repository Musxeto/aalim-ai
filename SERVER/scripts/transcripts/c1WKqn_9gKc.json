  "transcript": "Okay, Ayaan from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Me and my friend had to pray at school and one time in the area that we prayed there were people and we didn't want to pray in front of them so we delayed the prayer and is this like shirk and if it is do I have to say my shahadah publicly to him and can I continue to pray behind him? No there's no problem in delaying the prayer as long as you pray it within the parameters of the prayer. Every prayer has a beginning and an end if you pray in between there's no problem in that whether you delayed it because there were so many people in the room and you wanted to go to a secluded place or where there is no much noise or where people would not look at you there's no shirk in that none whatsoever."
