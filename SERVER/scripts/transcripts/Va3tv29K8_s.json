  "transcript": "namira from georgia uh so my question is uh when i washed a cloth with in the washing machine it had stains of impurity but it did not go so if like uh since it was wet and i kept that on like with other clothes the wet impurity will have like get transferred right so do i have to like wash everything because i don't exactly know what part of it touched the other clothes first of all the stain that remains after washing an impurity does not impact the purity of that cloth so a person has stains on his underwear and he washes it thoroughly with water and sometimes put detergents and the stain stills there the underwear is white and the stain is colored so the color remains so how many times do i have to wash it no this is sufficient as long as you thoroughly washed it until the mass of the impurity is gone and all what remains is the stain the the cloth is pure likewise what we throw in the washing machine it spins and rinses and washes it a number of times and then we get the clothes out wet smelling fresh and clean but there are stains this does not impact the purity the clothes are pure without any problem insha'allah you"
