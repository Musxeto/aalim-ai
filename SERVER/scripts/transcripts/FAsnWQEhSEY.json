  "title": "Is it permissible to rent my car or house to someone if they may use to do haram? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so Yousef had two questions from Ireland the first one what's the ruling on giving my car for lease to someone who wants to operate it as a taxi the answer is this is totally permissible I don't know whether he is going to take people to pubs or to the church or to use it to take pork meat from one place to the other Haram things for Muslims of course the answer is it's not your responsibility the action itself of renting or leasing your car to be used as a taxi this is halal what it is use then if you do not have evidence beyond doubt speculations and doubts cannot interfere or impact your decision for example someone comes to me and says share I sell bottles of water what's the ruling on that I said but check maybe the man who's buying it for me would put it into ice cubes and then drink it with whiskey I said Shama why do you assume the worst do you have any reason to doubt such a thing so no but maybe yeah maybe everything is maybe so when you brother Yusuf says to me assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah I say hi you said share I said Salaam alaikum yeah but maybe you're not a Muslim maybe you're pretending to be a Muslim maybe you're committing shirk or worshiping graveyards or wearing TVs or asking the dead to help you out of Allah then in this case everything would become Haram in life this is not the way we deal with things the default is good renting a car renting a house is halal what happens behind closed doors what happens without me knowing about it this is not my fault this is his fault and Allah knows best"
