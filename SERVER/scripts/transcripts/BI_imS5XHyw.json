  "transcript": "from the UK my question is does Allah have a shap or like Dimension and and if he yes does that does that limit to him what kind of a question is this yeah does a Muslim who prays five times a day and reads the Quran has the audacity to ask such a question does Allah have this or does Allah have that Subhan Allah you're a Muslim you should follow the Quran and follow the Sunnah and not follow the weird philosophy of people who want you to get out of the fold of Islam as Muslims as part of as followers of the prophet and the companions we only follow what's in the Quran and the Sunnah does the Quran and Sunnah tell us that Allah has a shape or a form or this or that these words are not mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah what is mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah number one and this is a measuring Rod there is nothing like Allah and he's all hearing allseeing so anything that crosses your mind Allah is unlike this you have to believe in this number two the Quran and Sunnah tells us that Allah has eyes that Allah has a face that Allah has hands two hands to be specific and that Allah has feet how you have to refer to rule number one nothing is unlike Allah so no matter how you think of it you are wrong so and there are many other rules but these would suffice so if someone says an elephant has a leg I as a human being have a leg and an aunt has a leg are any of these legs similar of course not the name is ident identifiable I can understand what a leg means but when we talk about the beautiful attributes of Allah Allah is unlike anything but we take what he described himself for granted and we don't misinterpret it or manipulate it or try to figure out anything that does not relate to reality how this is only in Allah's knowledge we acknowledge he has a hand subhana wa tala he has fingers he has eyes he hears he sees subhanahu wa taala we don't know how but we acknowledge and we believe so will you come and have the audacity to say oh what shape what form form what is this what is that you have to fear Allah because this is not what Allah will ask you about in your grave unless someone wants to flex his muscles and show his ability of philosophical philosophical things and uh trying to boast about it and to win an argument this is not Islam at all and Allah Knows Best"
