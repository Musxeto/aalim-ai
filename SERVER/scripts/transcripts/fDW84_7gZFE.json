  "transcript": "Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Alameen. Sallallahu Wasallam wa Barak ala al Mab'uthi Rahmatan lil Alameen. Nabiyina Muhammadin wa ala alihi wa sahbihi wa man ithada bihadihi wa istanna bi sunnatihi ila yawmi d-din. Amma ba'du. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Two points I would like to address before beginning this session. First, I'm not a doctor. I don't know why everyone insists on calling me Dr. Asim. I do not have a doctorate. I never pursued one. And I do not like the title. It's just Asim. Secondly, it is not befitting to describe someone as devoted himself to the spreading of... You're devoted what, Ya Sheikh? Come on, give me a break. I'm here on vacation. I come, they say, come, you have biryani, you have good meal, you stay in a five star hotel, and you give a lecture or two. OK. We do not know what's the meaning of devoting yourself to Allah Azza wa Jal. Seriously, let's be serious. So don't inflate people more than their actual size. They're here to give a lecture, give a talk. Jazakallah khair. But when you say they devoted themselves to Allah, and I think, me? Wow. So these two points I just wanted to address briefly so that we put people in their actual size instead of giving them more than what they deserve. Now, the title is scary."
