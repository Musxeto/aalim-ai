  "transcript": "consider subscribing hamza from the uk my question is chef uh i'm acting as a freelance a self-employed agent for a manufacturer in china who they make custom signs for different businesses so i called call different businesses asking if they're interested and then i receive their money if they want to place an order and i place an order for them with the manufacturer and then i keep my shares to agents so my question is the product includes a two-year guarantee for free replacement in case anything malfunctions on its own within that first two years so at what point am i allowed to spend my profits that i get as the agents and available myself of responsibility for the transaction is it as soon as the order is placed or after they receive the product or after the two years once that guarantee window is closed this depends on the agreement between you and the chinese company or the bangladeshi company or the malaysian company whatever company you are representing so if the agreement with them is the moment i secure an order and i send you the money and i keep my commission which is agreed upon you're not taking something that's not yours without their knowledge no they're allocating 10 for you as a commission i receive 100 quid i keep 10 i send them 90. and they are all fine with that and my agreement with them is that if anything were to happen in within these two years you will replace that product i am not liable in front of the customers the customers can sue you directly because most likely you don't have a legal representation of that company in you in the uk and therefore if there is a disagreement they would go directly to them if this is the case the moment you secure the deal and receive the money and you get your commission your deal is done whatever happens afterwards you have no problem in that inshallah you"
