  "transcript": "Omar from Germany um she um I asked you a few days ago if you will set up a marriage service and you said it it will be take uh too much work maybe some Dev developers will see this and want to work with you and will find an easy way for you and will uh you will maybe change your mind if you do please don't forget my 5% my question today is we are now approaching the last 10 nights of Ramadan inshah and there are people who spre like every year a list of up nights without knowing even if the month is 29 or 30 days long when we follow no this list or rely on their list would it be possible to miss because can be also on the even nights uh even uh even nights if you realize at the end of the month that Ramadan had 30 days this is quite true the can be most likely in odd nights the night of the 21st which starts tonight the night of the 23rd 25th 27th and the 29th and it can be in even days or nights so it can also be the 22nd the 24th the 26th and the 28th one would say but this is not 10 nights this is nine nights the answer would be yes because when we say the 10 Nights This is called this is a form of giving a number to what is usually the case but it can be nine as in the case for example when we say the fasting the 10 first days of the we know that the 10th day is it's prohibited to fast so why do we say doing good deeds in the 10 days of the we mean nine because the 10th is Exempted from fasting and the likes so yes this is a huge mistake that people do when they neglect the even days thinking that night of decree or cannot be in it and they're wrong"
