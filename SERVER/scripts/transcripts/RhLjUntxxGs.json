  "transcript": "[Music] actually i need your advice so one year ago i like a girl she was a writer a righteous muslim practicing muslim so she told him the only mistake i have done is that i proposed to her directly she told me that she is going to marry it so i blocked to her after one year i came to know that she lied to me so i contacted her again she told me that it was it was not a lie it is it wasn't i told you true but i came to know that she is lying to me so right now these thoughts are coming to me again and again uh actually i like her a lot and she's a righteous muslim so i want to know how to deal with these feelings and if you would pray for us um she lied to you that someone else proposed to her she told me that she is going to marry but i came to know that to marry who i don't know okay i will answer faizan from india one year ago he liked a woman he directly proposed to her she said i'm engaged or someone has proposed to me so he left her for a whole year and then a year later discovered that she lied to him and he again went into the same sin of communicating with someone who is haram for him to communicate with and she still lied to him again and he has mixed thoughts and he says she's practicing muslim etc it's obvious that shaytan is playing with you like children play with the football first of all she's a practicing muslim yet she's communicating with you she's not a practicing muslim a woman calls me and we we have a heated uh well not heated hot uh set of arguments and flirting together and she says well i was talking to a righteous practicing sheikh masha allah the heck with this sheikh having an affair flirting with the haram woman he's a practicing person she's a practicing woman communicating with you and she's no no i'm engaged and you said she's a she's lying and she communicates again with you the following year and she still lies and you say she's practicing yeah he get a life come on fear allah azzawajal and marry someone or propose to someone who's chaste who is truly practicing who if someone speaks to her slams the door in his face and says to him that you are a person who is a pervert and you're not a practicing muslim and she doesn't talk to him she ignores him she calls her brothers to give him a good beating that's a practicing muslim woman not someone like that so what you're doing again this has nothing to do with being practicing neither you nor her and this is shocking over and over again to get some questions like this saying that oh i'm practicing but i fell into the sin of mis communicating with anan mahram and we dated for a couple of years and alhamdulillah i have night prayer and i pray but unfortunately by mistake she got pregnant and we had to abort the child where it was eight months old it was a human being and we don't know what to do sheikh duh what is this this is bollywood this is not islam this doesn't come in islam the things you guys are saying don't say we're practicing don't say we follow the quran the sunnah we're on the salafi manhattan don't ever approach that just say we're muslims we're sinful we've done a sin okay we will come to help you in this but to claim that oh i'm salafi i'm this i'm that and then you bring all these catastrophes this is unheard of you"
