  "transcript": "um Bella says if makeup products are not halal then can we pray after applying those products or what if we apply after performing ablution or would see using makeup generally speaking it's Halle now if you know for certainty that there is an ingredient in it that makes it harm it becomes harem doubts do not count so many times people send us emails and messages and posts that using toothpaste is how long because it contains pork drinking soft drinks is Haram because it's made of the skin of pork it's where did you get this information it reliable sources this doesn't work like this if you're certain then it is Haram if not then the default is halal if I'm using this pan one says share some one of the ingredients in the ink used in this is the blood of Muslims from so in so country a little bit I'm not going to use this what is the evidence of this he said that he said is not sufficient show me evidence that can stand in a court of law so makeup in general is okay now if someone claims that there is this so-and-so Haram ingredients and you sure and certain of it you cannot apply it whether after salat or before wood or after we do because buying it because of its Haram ingredients is Haram people ask me can we wear shoes made of pork skin why would a Muslim do that he said I'm not gonna pray in it he buying such skin or such shoes made of such skin is prohibited buying such skin is is not permissible in Islam let alone wearing it so if the makeup you are certain that it contains Haram ingredients you should not buy it you must not use it but if it's just speculations if they say that it includes glycerin or such products that undergone rigorous process of changing their physical and chemical attributes until they change into a new substance in this case this is halal and Allah surgeon knows best"
