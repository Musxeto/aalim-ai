  "transcript": "[Music] among the best deeds that we can do is charity paying charity to the poor into the needy and with this lockdown we have seen the rise in poverty levels all over the muslim world and i mean really poor and imagine people who earn on daily basis people who work as painters as plumbers as construction workers and laborers when they are prevented from going to work for four months so income is zero they're even prevented from traveling going back home okay let me go home at least i have a house i can eat from my farm i do anything so so no sorry there's no traveling so i'm locked in my home i can't work what do you want me to do to steal this is a predicament that lots of the muslims fell into so now it is time to give a helping hand to look for those around you who are honorable whose dignity prevents them from approaching you and telling you that listen my kids are starving some people would rather die of starvation rather than beg people so look for them around you in your neighborhoods and try to be helpful as much as you can and remember that the prophet said alaihis he said that a charity extinguishes the heat of the graves for its inhabitants so if i pay now tomorrow when i'm in my grave and it's hot my charity would come and make it air-conditioned it would extinguish the heat in my graves in my grave and the prophet said allah and a person on the day of judgment he is under the shade of his charity so you hit two birds with one stone ten first ten days of give and give generously"
