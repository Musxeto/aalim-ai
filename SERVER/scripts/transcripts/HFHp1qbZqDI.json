  "transcript": "doing very well sir. Alhamdulillah. I read that if we don't lose anything until we start to lose our religion and Allah says that if we test us with something of fear so we should fear Him. So recently I noticed that my Fajr is now most of the time after sunrise so my Isha is about 15 to 20 minutes midnight so my prayer is the rest of my prayer are manageable and I've been struggling to learn Arabic language since at least 2022. So I keep getting discouraged and forgetting and most of it I've been brainwashed like if you should tell me something today in the next 15 minutes I'm forgetting so can you please help me in this kind of situation and is the Duha that says oh Allah help me to remember you to worship you and to give thanks to you in the best manner, does it suffice in this kind of situation sir? This Duha is narrated by Mu'adh Ibn Jabal may Allah be pleased with him and he was instructed by the Prophet Alayhi Salaam to say this Duha at the end of every Salat. So we say it before we conclude our Salat and we say it after Salat we always say it all the time. Your problem with memory is done through or is solved through practice. Practice makes perfect so if you fail to memorize few things repeating them 10 times, 50 times, 100 times would cement it in your memory and this is what a lot of the Huffadh of the Qur'an do. When they want to cement their memorization they repeat the same ayah 100 times and this would make it fixed in their memory for quite a long time insha'Allah. So you give it a shot and a try."
