  "title": "How much time can I spend on playing with the Rubik's Cube? Is it wasting time? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his fourth question was about aerobic I think it's called aerobic cube and and the one with the colors so there is a way of doing it in a very quick fashion and he's asking is this permissible to do and can I spend time doing it and how much time is permissible well if we look back at your whispers at your acquiring knowledge of a PD and fit and compare it to this then this is a little bit shaky people should not waste their time on things that bring no benefit to them so okay you can solve it in like five seconds so what you can solve it blindfolded so what this is nothing to be proud of it's not something that would get you closer to Allah if it's a hobby that you're doing while maybe not watching not concentrating yes but if you invest time in it and it has no value I don't think that this is appropriate would it be permissible to listen to lectures there's no problem in listening to lectures while doing it as long as you're attentive to what is being said in the lecture in sha Allah"
