  "title": "Blind Following and the Absence of Planning - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Many of the people they blindly follow actresses, actor and celebrities blindly. You know people who see a lot of Hindi movies from Bollywood. They want to settle in Bombay. Why? Because Amitab Bachan comes to Bombay and within few weeks, few months he becomes a multi-millionaire. So they think if we settle in Bombay because of Bollywood we will become [Music] multi-millionaire then someone buys a car Hyundai Sentro I 10 why we bought this car because Shah Ruk Khan he was adding this car I doubt whether Shah Ruk Khan ever sat in a Honda Centro i 10 before after that for the ad for the money he might have sat he may be having maybe a BMW or a Mercedes I didn't do research but he may not be driving a Sentro highend i10 maybe for the ad he got money so for the ad he might have sat in that car after that I doubt he ever sat in a Hyundai Sanro i10 you know many of the actors and celebrities they are brand ambassadors like the brand ambassador of Tagore Tagore watch is Shah Rukh Khan. So you think if you wear a tag or watch you'll become Shah Ruk Khan. So this is called blindly following. Blind following. Then there are people who have a goal like one businessman he buys a textile factory because he knows that in textile industry good profit so he buys it and he has openly ceremony so when we ask him that have you appointed a CEO he says no then we ask him where are you going to buy the textile from he says I don't know where you going to sell your textile he says I don't know so he has a goal that means he knows that in textile industry there's profit but no planning goal without planning let me give you another example there's a person who wants to become the greatest scientist he wants to become a good scientist so he does research and he finds out that the greatest scientist of humankind was Isaac Newton. So he does his research and then he starts growing hair like Isaac Newton. He wears clothes like Isaac Newton. He wears shoes like Isaac Newton. Do you think he'll become a scientist? He has a goal. He also has a planning but wrong planning. He thinks by keeping hair like Isaac Newton or wearing clothes like Isaac Newton or wearing shoes like Isaac Newton he will become a scientist. So this is an example of a goal with planning but wrong planning. Who is the best who can give the reply to the question what is the purpose of our lives? Is it a teacher? Can the best answer be given by a doctor, by a psychologist? Can it be given by Dr. Zakai? No. The best reply can be given by our creator Allah subhanana wa ta'ala. And Allah gives this reply in surah chapter number 51 verse number 56. And I started my talk with this verse of the Quran that we have created the jin and the men not but to worship me. So Allah subhanana wa ta'ala our creator our sustainer our cherisher he is telling us in the last and final revelation the glorious Quran that we have created the jin and the men not but to worship him worship Allah subhanana wa ta'ala so our main purpose of life is to worship Allah subhanana wa ta'ala the Arabic word used here is ibada coming from the root root word Arabic abd meaning a servant a slave. So ibada means following the commandments of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala. Whenever you follow the commandments of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala, it is called as ibada. It is called as worshiping Allah subhanana wa ta'ala."
