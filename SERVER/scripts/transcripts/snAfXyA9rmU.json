  "title": "Which prayer time calculation is correct, Umm ul Qura or ISNA? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "my next question is I've heard in multiple videos that you said that the budget of Omaha is correct and I see that a lot of mosques here in Canada they use asana Ethne and I've asked them and they said Ethne it's correct so uh so I'm a bit confused on whether to use Ethne or Omaha quota for budget however I know umm al-qura is inaccurate for salat early his second question was regarding omal kora calculation and I said that before that to my knowledge to my limited knowledge people doubted Oh Melora calendar when it came to fire prayer and Shaykh Salah halvvasan himself went to the open for a number of nights to witness the actual fire breaking and he said that when he saw the fetcher breaking which was the truth ledger which is a horizontal fetcher it coincided exactly with amon korra calculation which means that their calculation is the accepted one insha allah who as the agile I don't know about isne I don't know about their calculation but I know that this is from sheikh salih headphones on and he's a trusted scholar and Allah knows best"
