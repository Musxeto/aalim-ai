  "transcript": "Finally, Sumayya says, is it permissible to say things to my kid, like, if you don't eat food, the crow will take it away, or if you do that, then the police will come and take you. This is not permissible. This is a lie, and we as Muslims are prohibited from lying. Abdullah ibn Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, says, once the Prophet ﷺ came to visit us when I was a young boy, and my mom said to me, come, let me give you this. So the child came, and the Prophet said, what are you going to give him? So she opened her hand, and there was a date. And she said, O Prophet of Allah, I was going to give him this date. The Prophet ﷺ said, had you not had anything in your hand, that would have been a lie. So many times, people do this with their children. Come, come, let me give you this. And when they come, they grab the child. This is prohibited. And this is a sin, even with children. Not only that, some scholars say that it's a sin even with animals. Al-Muallimi, may Allah have mercy on his soul, writes that some students of hadith went to a sheikh to hear and note down the hadith he was reporting. You know, the chain of narrators? He was one of them. And when they went to see him and meet him, they found him with his mule, and he had a bucket, doing this to the mule so that the mule could come and he could get hold of it. When they looked in the bucket, they found it empty. They turned around and left. And when people said, wait, you didn't hear from the sheikh? You didn't register anything? They said, if he lies to a mule, we can't trust him that he may not lie and fabricate a hadith. He's not trustworthy. So in Islam, we cannot even lie to an animal, let alone a child, let alone a grown-up man. Unfortunately, the Muslims are light-years away from such etiquettes that constitute the essence of our beautiful religion. They don't know, or they know, but that they're not willing to practice it because of all what they see around them. All what they're interested in is the buck, money, how to be wealthy, how to be famous as soon as possible. Lie, cheat, accept bribes, do whatever it takes to reach where you want to reach. But this is a life that is limited to a number of years. Once it's expired, then you have eternity, whether in heaven or in hell, and the choice is yours. www.mooji.org"
