  "transcript": "muhammad from the philippines is one sinful or does it affect one's fast if during the daytime ramadan or if one is fasting one does things or works that will really make one become tired like doing some ecosystem okay so the question is if i do something that would make me tired while fasting would i be sinful would i miss reward of my fasting the answer is no your fasting is fasting whatever you do as long as you continue to fast and it doesn't get you in harm's way there's no problem in that many people fast yet go to the gym or play squash or play tennis while fasting yes there would be an amount of hardship they're having fun they're enjoying it and their fast does not go against it you see at the time of the prophet people used to fast not only in ramadan mondays thursdays white days alternate days they have no they had no problem with fasting none of them was crippled by fasting and sitting back home chilling and relaxing because he's unable to do anything due to his fasting no they resumed their normal lives and lots of the muslims today alhamdulillah days fast the mondays and thursdays and they go to the gym they do their weight training they maybe they don't do their cardio as hard as they used to when they're not fasting but they still go to work they go shopping they go to the gym they work out they get a little bit more tired but there's no harm on them physically or medically and there's no problem in that none whatsoever inshallah you"
