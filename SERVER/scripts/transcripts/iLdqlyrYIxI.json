  "title": "Shorten & Combine if 80 kilometers  - HADITH EXPLAINED (qasr travelers prayer)",
  "transcript": "Omar from Germany according uh to Islam qu um many schoolers have set a standard for combin and shorting prayers with uh 80 kilm and this is also what the summary says uh from this topic but in this topic is a Hadith is also mentioned where the Prophet Sall wasallam shed the prayer when he traveled three far this is which about 17 16 kilometers and the letter view is the view like um Islam favored by Islam because Allah did not state a specific distance that makes shorting prayers permissible and neither the prophet sallam and according to the end in this topic Islam says the view of Islam Tamia is closer to what is correct so my question is what is the minimum distance for traveling for short and combine prayers for someone which travels sometimes 30 or 40 kilomet and feel like as a traveler this is not right and that's is good and the reason is the Hadith talking about that he shortened and combined after leaving for three far or just as he left Medina is not talking about the distance people don't understand the Hadith and this is the biggest problem with laymen when they read classical books or hadiths without going back to understand from the scholars and I ask them I'm traveling from Munich to Frankfurt the distance is I don't know how much and after leaving Munich for about 5 kilomet and I want to pray after leaving the borders of Munich for 5 kilm or 4 kilm should I shorten and combine or not the answer is yes not because I traveled the 5 kilomet my travel is like 500 kmet maybe so this is the distance of traveling not the 5 kilometers not the three the people when they read this Hadith they thought they think that the prophet went for three and came back no he went for a whole month of traveling or for two weeks or for a long distance but when did he start to shorten and to combine the moment he left the city limits of Medina three far so those who don't know or understand they jump the gun oh okay so if I travel from this neighborhood to this neighborhood and it's 10 kilometers this is more than three I can shorten no a you're not a traveler anyone who goes from point A to point B which is 20 kilm or 30 km or even 50 kilm we all know that this is not traveling they commute but not traveling and if it's on the autoban with your 911 as you can do that in like 5 minutes this is not traveling so understand the Hadith and don't try to bend the rules to fit your whims and desires rather go back and check with the scholars reading articles on QA Islam Q&A or Islam web and the likes without the interpretation and the explanation of Scholars would put you in trouble and Allah Knows Best"
