  "transcript": "Ismail from Bahrain Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh I have two questions. Yes, one only. Which one is that? Sorry. One only. Okay Sheikh. So there's my one friend he in order to stop doing a sin he said that he made a promise to Allah that if he does it again he won't be a Muslim. But he fell into that and he did it. Now what should he do now? This is ignorance from your friend's side and Alhamdulillah it doesn't take him out of the fold of Islam but it was a major sin. So if he made such a pledge that if I were to do such a thing then I'm not a Muslim anymore. And he did not mean that he would become a Kafir. Rather he meant to say something that would deter him and stop him from doing such a sin. And he felt or he fell weak and did it. He does not become a Kafir but he has to expiate for the oath he broke and he has to repent and ask Allah for forgiveness and feel deep remorse in him and Allah knows best."
