  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So I just wanted to clarify a question I asked you earlier but I asked you in an incorrect way. So the question was that I was washing my left foot in Wudu one time and I had the urge to pass wind and I tried to wash the feet quickly before suppressing the wind and then I did that, I tried to wash the feet, I suppressed the wind which took some time, some seconds, I don't know, and then after that I thought of checking the foot if it's wet but then I got the thought like everything is wet by now so how would you know that you washed it and the water is from somewhere else because the sink was wet. So I took some more time to think and then I decided to wash the whole foot again. So my concern is the time I took for thinking and the time I took for suppressing the wind, that will cause a gap in my Wudu. So is my Wudu valid? Yes, it is valid. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
