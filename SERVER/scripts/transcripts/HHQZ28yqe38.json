  "transcript": "and from bangladesh in my country we have a money transferring system like paypal so here you know here um for example um you keep for example you keep 50 50 okay and now for example i want to buy a shoe so if i use this app use this app they are going to give me 20 cashback so scholars here are saying that this cashback is halal so what is your view on this sheikh i hope you understand the question inshallah i hope so i'll try nabi from bangladesh the cashback okay the cashback depends on where you deposit the cash so if you put in this app fifty dollars so you are depositing 50 which means that they're benefiting from your loan because this 50 is guaranteed to be returned to you whenever you want it so it is a loan to them if they give you a cash back this is river but if i borrow from them like a credit card and i buy something for ten thousand dollars and they give me cash back this is permissible because i did not deposit or invest anything with them i actually borrowed and they gave me some of that percentage as cashback"
