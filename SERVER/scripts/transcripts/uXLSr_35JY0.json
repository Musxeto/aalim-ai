  "title": "Imam usually repeats the same surahs in every prayer | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Avel use of second question that the Imam where he prays often usually repeats the same verses about the story of Musa and Pharaoh and he seems to does not like this and or let me rephrase that but nobody does not like Quran but he was advising the Imam to change and two very different stories so that the people would also benefit and enjoy it from the Quran and and his request is normal and legitimate but at the end of the the day what the Imam is doing is reciting the Quran so even if he recites school who Allah hadn't repeats it its Quran and you have done your duty by praying in the Masjid whether the Imam does not memorize anything except these sewers or whether the Imam has an emotional attraction to the stories of mosa of musa peace be upon him as he is the most frequent frequently mentioned prophet in the quran the most due to the similarity between his story and life with the story and life of our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and it is a sort of comfort to the Prophet Allah so Sam when he goes through the story of Musa and see how the Jews had mistreated him and that was would be a form of relief to our prophet alayhi salatu salam when he sees the abused of his people to him and their disbelief so I hope this is a Charla something that can be lived with as it's not a serious issue"
