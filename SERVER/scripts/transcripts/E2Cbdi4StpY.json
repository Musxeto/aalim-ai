  "title": "Ruling on saying WajhAllah alayk? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "uh so my question is um what is the permissibility what is the ruling on saying and this is used in in sudan by the sudanese most likely and this is a form of swearing by allah you should do this and this is inappropriate or you may say it's prohibited why sheikh swearing by allah is permissible wallahi you will do this if he doesn't do it i'll expect end of story but when you say this is seeking the intercession of allah to a human being so as if you're asking him by allah's face do this for me and it is not permissible to ask anything by allah's face except paradise and nobody has paradise in his hands except allah so to disrespect allah by using his face with a human being in such trivial issues is between haram and inappropriate and i'm in more inclined to say that it is prohibited and not permissible on llano's best"
