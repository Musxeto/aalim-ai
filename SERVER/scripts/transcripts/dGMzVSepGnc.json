When I say it, it means that I obey him in\nwhat he orders [ ] and I refrain from whatever he prohibits [ ] and I believe in whatever he says from the\nthings that are unseen or that happened in the past [ ] and I do not worship Allah except by what\nhe had ordained and told us [ ] This is what [ ] entails, this is what it\nmust contain otherwise a person is not a Muslim, a person is not a follower of the Prophet\nﷺ"
