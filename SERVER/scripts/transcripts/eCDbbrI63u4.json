  "transcript": "[Music] abu house from bangladesh chief my question is uh i face a situation very often unfortunately and that is uh my mom my sister and my grandma uh they like go to the relative's houses uh for different kind of occasions might be birthdays etc haram events where it's like mixed together there might be innovative events or something like this now when they go uh they go either on uber or like the driver is uh not a machamp or only to my grandma so sheif uh in such situations is it mandatory for me to accompany my parents are they traveling or only within the city limits uh within the city limits okay by car like i fear like there's seclusion so uh do i do i will answer inshallah abu haf says from bangladesh my mom my my mother and my sister and my grandmother they may go to some relative's house and this relative's house is in some other neighborhood within dhaka or within the city we live in with an uber driver so am i sinful for not dropping them the answer is no there's nothing haram in three women or two women riding with a stranger taking them to a place they want like a taxi a driver a cab or an uber or whatever because there is no seclusion seclusion is when a man is with a woman that's it nobody is with them in the cockpit in the car itself this is seclusion which is haram the third one is shaytan with them you can imagine what he would incite them to do so this is not prohibited for three women to travel not to travel to commute within the city limits with a nun mahram and allah knows but having said that what kind of a man allows his mother and daughter and sister to go with a stranger when he is already with them they're going to a birthday party and it's haram i should not assist them that's that's true but it's the worst of the two evils taking them is a chance to give them dawah to show them how beautiful islam is to make them love you and respect you so that whenever you give them advice they will accept it and it's an issue of dispute there are scholars though this is totally weak opinion who say that birthday parties are permissible so you have some room to maneuver in [Music] london's you"
