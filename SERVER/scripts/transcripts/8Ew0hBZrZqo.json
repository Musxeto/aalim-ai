  "transcript": "Jazakumullahu Khair Divorce her because he does not love her This is stupid With all due respect Do you think all those who are married Love their wives? Of course Sheikh No no the definition of love What is it? It's not Hollywood Nor Bollywood Nor Nollywood I've heard this Recently They have Bollywood in India They have Bollywood in Nigeria I hope they don't have Collywood In Kenya This is a problem So They think that love is When I go after 20 years or 30 years of marriage Enter the house Oh my husband, oh my wife And we exchange kisses and emojis And heartbeats and flowers You crazy After 5 days of marriage There is nothing like this What remains Is the respect The compassion The mercy The kindness The care And this is much much much more than love Because you can love someone In one hour And leave them This is not love, this is physical Attraction It is not the love you are talking about So once you are married In an arranged marriage Look at The wife you have Or the husband you have Whether they check all the boxes Or not Most likely they check 90% Of the boxes 10% nobody is perfect But shaitan focuses On the 10% Your spouse is not the one You want Akhi when you get this Go to a closed room Turn on the lights And stand in front of a mirror And look Deep into yourself How many boxes do you check Whoa I don't check any boxes And she is still living with you She is accepting you For how bad you are Ya akhi do this And smell your breath In the garbage can When was the last time you took a shower Ramadan shaykh Mashallah People have odor When they don't shower You have odor Audhubillah Ya akhi she is accepting you And you are not Elon Musk mashallah You are throwing dollars all over the place You have a very tight budget Every time where did you spend this How much did you spend it Ya akhi do this Turn off the lights The AC So you have so many bad things in you And she is accepting you And she loves you And she respects you And now you say wallah shaykh I don't have love Go divorce her Let her marry a real man Who would protect her Who would love her Who would take care of her And look how she would torture you Humilate you Insult you And make a scandal of you Everywhere And then you come to shaykh Asif for counseling session You have to pay $110 Hmm"
