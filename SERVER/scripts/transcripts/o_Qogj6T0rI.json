  "title": "It is a MUST to move the lips & tongue while praying, dhikr, and dua | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "how do I say it verbally or in my mind this is also another serious issue a lot of us when reciting the Quran they tend to recite it by visualizing and reading the letters without moving their tongues and lips likewise when you see people making dua raising their hands while their lips are sealed and also people who are praying when they're standing and praying they just say Allahu Akbar and that's it they close their lips and they decide the Fatih had the surah Allah ho Akbar and they say somehow darling with their lips sealed scholars from all types of schools of thought I've searched this and I was devastated because this is how I used to recite the Quran and pray and do my dhikr thinking that this is sufficient but I looked into it and not a single scholar from the past nor the present from the contemporary Muftis to the old Salif scholars had ever said that this is valid they all insist and make it a condition that you have to move your lips and your tongue as if you're speaking but without making any sound and this is what they call silent now when you say it loud you verbalize it and you make a sound to it when uttering it so you have to say it's not mute I'm just saying it with my lips but without voice so don't think that the volume is beautiful so this is how it should be set in order for it to be accepted now imagine how many millions of Muslims hold the Quran and recite it without moving their lips thinking that this does the job and it doesn't I'd appreciate it if you look and we were able to find something from the Salif that supports reading without moving your lips and tongue would suffice and would be valid"
