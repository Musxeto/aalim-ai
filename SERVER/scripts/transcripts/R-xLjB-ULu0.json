  "transcript": "Sheikh I read somewhere that if we laugh on people who are suffering, Allah has the power to revert that suffering on from them on us. Is this kind of saying true and is believing such things you know allowed in Islam? There is no such hadith that backs it up to my knowledge but the Salaf have stated this many many times in their literature. So they used to say don't laugh at someone who's being tested so that Allah would not cure his test and test you instead of him. And they also said when you see someone being tormented or tested you should not make fun of him or you should not look down upon him because this feeling of adding us would come back to you as a form of punishment from Allah Azza Wa Jal. But the only hadith that I know of is that when you see someone who's being tested or who's being tried, you should say whoever says this dua when he sees someone being tested or in a calamity, Allah would not test him with the same test. So maybe this is the only thing that is authentic and Allah knows best."
