  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh   Sheikh some scholars in my country say that \nwhen we're making Dua during Salah in sujud or   after tashahud we cannot ask Allah for anything \nrelated to the Dunya they say you can only ask   for things related to the Hereafter and if we \nask for anything in the Dunya that salah will   be invalidated so I wanted to know if this is \ntrue or not of course this is not true at all and   these so-called Scholars are talking without \nknowledge they are restricting people from   begging and asking Allah if I have debts who am \nI to ask if I have an illness who am I to ask   if I have a Calamity who am I to beg in Salat \nof course Allah so you're telling me that I   can only ask for forgiveness and for Jannah in my \nprayer in my sujood and not to ask Allah azzawajal   for anything else this is totally incorrect in \nits baseless and it is restricting people from   calling Allah invoking him supplicating to him and \nasking him for what they need where nowhere in the   Quran or the Sunnah the Allah azzawajal restricted \nthem from asking such a thing and Allah Knows Best"
