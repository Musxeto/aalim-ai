  "title": "Can we pray Absentee Funeral Prayer (Salat ul Gha'ib) multiple times? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "in regards to the issue of salatullah hi the scholars have different whether it is permissible indefinitely to offer funeral prayer to whomever it had died and we were not able to witness his janazah or not so sometimes you go to a Masjid and one of the brothers says he he goes to the Imam and says okay my uncle died in in the UK and he was a dear uncle to me and I'd like to pray generous a lot alive so after isha prayer day mom says we will offer salah to fight for so and so and and and tomorrow Fechter another one says well my brother died in egypt and prayer another one says my uncle died in Syria and what is in the message we have like a thousand people frame every single fault and definitely one of them must have lost a loved one so it's this part of this fun to do this that says no there are so many people who had died and the Prophet did not offer Ali's awesome funeral prayer for their souls because they were in other countries so why did the Prophet offer it erase all Salam over the Abyssinian king scholar said because he was the only Muslim and there were no Muslims around him to offer it but if a Muslim dies in a country where the community takes care of washing him shrouding him offering funeral prayer on him and burying him in this case it is not legitimate for us to offer such a prayer now if you were someone who was travelling and came back and a loved one a relative who had died last month to go enough for such a prayer there's no problem Shama what about offering funeral prayer a number of times there's no problem we've washed shrouded our deceased in our house and now he is at the side of the room waiting for the ambulance to come and pick him up to go to the Masjid women come and pray no problem men offer pure funeral prayer on their own no problem we take him to the Masjid after folks a lot we offer funeral prayer in congregation those who prayed home can pray again we take him to the cemetery and they were late comers who did not offer it so before the barrier they place it and they pray funeral prayer and we can't rejoin them so this is a third time no problem it's a door it's a prayer it's a good thing to offer there's no problem in that inshallah"
