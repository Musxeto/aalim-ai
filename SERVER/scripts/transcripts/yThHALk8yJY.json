  "transcript": "In an authentic hadith, Sahl Ibn Hunayf, may Allah be pleased with him, one of the companions of the Prophet ﷺ, was with the Prophet once and they were travelling nearby Medina and he needed to wash himself either to cool down or to clean up and at the time people had no lavatories, no bathrooms, they were camping, they were travelling, so all what he needed to do was to cover his awrah from the navel to the knee and then do what he was supposed to do. So he was washing himself and in order to do this of course his upper part of the body was exposed and Amr Ibn Rabi'ah saw him bathe and he was amazed and he said to himself, I have not seen such clear and pure skin like today. Look at Sahl's skin. So he's telling the people around him, his friends, look how pure his skin is and the moment he said this, Sahl fell on the ground, he could not raise his head, he got sick. So the people went to the Prophet ﷺ seeking his guidance, telling him, wouldn't you come and see what happened to Sahl, maybe you can help him. So he said, what happened? They said, the O Prophet of Allah, he has fainted, he fell sick, he's unable to even raise his head. So the Prophet ﷺ said to them, do you accuse anyone of doing something wrong? So they said, well, Amr Ibn Rabi'ah, may Allah be pleased with him, looked at him and we suspect that he gave him an evil eye. So the Prophet ﷺ summoned Amr and rebuked him, admonished him and was really harsh to him and he said, why would any one of you kill his brother? Why if you were to see something you like, wouldn't say, may Allah bless it? So the Prophet ﷺ directed Amr and the Muslims how to block the evil eye and how not to make such a mistake in the future. To say, may Allah bless you, Allahumma barik, barakallahu lak, this is what we use to block our evil eye. Now I know some of you would think that we are in the era of space travel, NASA and we have technological advances and science and the likes and you're telling us about evil eye? At the end of the day, we are Muslims and we believe in the Qur'an and the Sunnah and we definitely believe that they override any science because this is from Allah Azza wa Jal, the creator of the heavens and the earth and it's a proven record for the past 15 centuries that everything in the Qur'an and in the Sunnah is authentic, valid, scientific, logical, proven without any doubt. So why would I suspect? Why would I not believe in the presence of the evil eye when it is mentioned in the Qur'an and it is mentioned in the authentic Sunnah and we see it with our own eyes. We see it in our own lives, how people are affected by the evil eye. I know people that when they go in some places and see something they like, immediately something bad happens especially when they comment on it without saying Allahumma Barik. Some people go to a room, they turn on the light and the lights are so bright and they say whoa and immediately the light goes off. The light bulb is burnt, gone. People see a car and they say wow what a fast car and five minutes later it has an accident and the Prophet ﷺ said the evil eye is truth, is something that is existing. It would cause a camel to die and be cooked and go into the cooking pot and it would cause a man to enter his grave. Sometimes we ourselves give evil eye without knowing to our own children when we don't say Allahumma Barik. When we see our own children play around and we say whoa look how fast he is, how strong he is, without saying Allahumma Barik. So evil eye exists."
