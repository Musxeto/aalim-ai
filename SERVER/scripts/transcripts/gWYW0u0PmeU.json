  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah. My name is Yusnida. I am from KL. I would like to ask, as we are progressing and we are learning and we get our qualification in Dean, sometimes we got the invitation to teach and we got the pay. It's haunting me that because we also learned that giving da'wah based on to get monetary reward is kind of minorship. Who said so? Then I will be committing shirk. No, I mean, for the sake of Allah, but then how do you define whether you are accumulating wealth or you are getting the pay for your service? I will answer you. First of all, this is a very huge misconception among people that taking money in exchange of teaching Quran or teaching the sunnah or leading the salat in the masjid is haram and minorship. This is not true. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, said that we traveled on an expedition and we ran out of food. Then we came to a tribe of non-Muslims and we asked them for hospitality and they refused. So we took a side and sat. Minutes later, a servant comes and says, is any one of you able to do ruqya? And ruqya was for Arabs and non-Arabs, for Muslims and non-Muslims. They had ruqya of jinn, for example. So this is a kafir tribe. Why? They said, because our tribe's leader has been stung either by a scorpion or by a snake or something and he's dying. So one of them said, I can offer you ruqya, but we asked for hospitality, refused. You give us 30 heads of sheep and I'll do ruqya. So they agreed. So the man says, I went there, I recited only the Fatiha and blew. And in seconds, the man stood up as nothing has been affecting him. So they gave us the sheep. Now we were in a dilemma. Shall we eat the sheep or not? We will take it to Medina. So they went to Medina and said to the Prophet, we did this and this and this. So the Prophet said, how did you know it's ruqya? By Allah, it's ruqya. The man only recited Fatiha and took what? Money for that. The Prophet said, take my share, my 20%, my fifth from it. And he took it and accepted it. What does this mean? That you can teach people Quran for money. Someone comes to me, Shaykh, I'd like you to give me an hour of your time. Teach me Surah Al-Baqarah, Tajweed and Hifadh. I said, OK. You have to pay me X amount of money. I said, Shaykh, fear Allah. You're teaching me the Quran for money? He said, do you think I'm a charity organization? I have to make a living. You're taking one hour of my time. To do what? So you're charging for the Quran, Shaykh? No, I'm charging for my time. Likewise, the muezzin who gives adhan or the imam, if he's given money from the ruler or the Muslim government, this is halal money. Teachers in universities, they teach hadith, they teach aqeedah, they charge salary. Oh, fear Allah. Why fear Allah? And the doctor doesn't fear Allah? And the lawyer doesn't fear Allah? So this is not logical. This money is a compensation for my time, not for my knowledge. If you come and ask me while walking the street, Shaykh, what's the ruling on this? Yeah, this is haram. But to answer questions, to solve people's problems with your spare time, this is for Allah. But when you say, no, I need time with you. And I have a million or two or three million followers. If I give each one of them five minutes, how do I live? I will die. My time would be gone. So it's not shirk. Shirk is when you bargain. Shaykh, we would like you to be our imam in the Alawi masjid in Perlis. This is the only masjid I know, so excuse me. So I said, how much you're giving me? He said, we are giving you 5,000 ringgits and a half. I said, no, masjid Ahmadi is giving me 10,000. So if you can match this, maybe. No, bargaining? Wait. This is not the right thing to do. But I hope this answers your question."
