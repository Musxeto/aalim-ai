  "transcript": "romagna says is it permissible for a menstruating woman to enter the Masjid what if her Koran classes are conducted in the Masjid building this is an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that it is prohibited for a woman in her menses to enter a Masjid and the evidence is that the Prophet I Suzanne was once in the message and we know that the prophets house was adjacent to the Masjid only a door separated them apart so the Prophet ordered mother Aisha to hand him a towel he was in the Masjid she was in her home shoes she said o prophet of Allah I cannot I mean I am in my menses she was menstruating so the Prophet answered her with an answer that any layman could understand he said to her I know that you are you you are in your menses but your menses is not in your hand meaning that when you are handing it to me through the door when your hand enters the Masjid there's nothing prohibited in that rather if you walked in then it's Haram anyone could understand this from the statement of the Prophet ala salatu salam because if it had no impact being in menses or not he would have said so being in menses come in the Masjid there's no problem he said handing it is permissible but walking in is not this is what the scholars understood from this authentic hadith and Allah knows best so even if your Koran classes are held in the Masjid in the same buildings of the Masjid you cannot attend that"
