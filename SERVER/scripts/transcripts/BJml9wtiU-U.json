  "transcript": "Allah protect us from making such an error in our lives inshallah so for the uh benefit of the viewers Dr Zak could you explain why the practice of black magic is prohibited and it's one of the major sins in Islam in Islam black magic is kuf it is kuf in Islam and it has been labeled as one of the major sins in say bukari volume number four Hadith number 2766 where the Beloved Prophet said that the seven most destructive sins are and the first he said that joining Gods with Allah that is shik number two is murder number three is practicing black magic that sorcery so mham sahi wasallam the messenger of Allah subhana tala he has labeled black magic practicing sorcery as one of the major sins in Islam and Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 102 that they learn things which harm not which brings profit to others so only this black magic only brings harm and does not bring gain or profit to anyone it's mentioned in Surah T chapter number 20 verse number 64 which says that however much The Magicians however much skills they have they will never be successful success will never be there however skillful they are and it's further mentioned in Sur Bak chapter number two verse number 102 thatan Alam did not disbelieve it is the shtin it is the Devils who disbelieved because they practiced black magic and other things which were sent on the city of Babylon to the two angels harut and marut but these two angels they never did kuf they never disbelieved and they never practice black magic but they always told the people that we have been sent as a trial as a test so do not disbelieve and do not practice the black magic so black magic is KF in Islam and the punishment for a person who practices black magic is death penalty but unfortunately there are many Muslims who indulge in Black Magic many of the Muslims they go to a person who does black magic in order to take revenge from someone in order to hurt enemy which is totally Haram in Islam it's totally prohibited unfortunately some of our Muslims when black magic is run on them they go to The Magicians asking them to save them from the Black Magic the best person to to seek protection is from Allah subhana tala and Allah subhana wa taala has revealed the mo the last two suras of the Quran Surah number 113 that is and Surah number 114 that is Surah Nas we say Seek refuge in The Lord of the Daybreak School say I seek Refuge with the Lord of Dawn and it says in that seek Refuge from the people who practice black magic and Sur n chapter number 114 from those who whisper and withdraw so these two suras were specifically revealed as a relief as a protection from Black Magic so black magic is one of the major sins in Islam and indulging it directly or indirectly is private in Islam"
