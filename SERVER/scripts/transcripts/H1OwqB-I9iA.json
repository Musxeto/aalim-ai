  "transcript": "this I know it's a feeling a lot of people this age often have how do I deal with overthinking and anxiety often I question a lot of Islamic and worldly matters and I overthink about these things things sometimes it leads to me uh to feeling very negative and having a negative mindset different was coming to the mind how do I deal with this starting off with book a counseling session if you can afford it seriously this is what I do I talk with people with OCD and it's fun it's it drains me a lot unfortunately but it's fun because I've met like a thousand a gazillion of them and youth from all over the world come complaining of anxiety and panic attacks Whispers of Shan and it can be in wo in purific ation in have I committed orur saying 50 times a day taking shower 10 times a day repeating the woo five times every time they make wo and so forth and these people it's it's like a recording that I say okay and before he finishes his presentation I say okay you do this you do this how did you know said I have a crystal ball no I know I've I've seen so so many like you so one of the easiest ways of taking you off track for Shan is overthinking because overthinking includes lack of IM weakness of IM negativity in thinking about Allah oh Allah is going to throw me in Hell Allah is just waiting for me to trip and I'm going to be in hell for etern names what are they all of these beautiful names about Allah's forgiveness and mercy and compassion and and and and guiding people to repent and accepting their repentance you neglect and insist that Allah is going to throw me in hell and this is how shaan works and you're feeding it and it show you your problem nobody's going to help you you you're an adult sh can you take my hand why I want to go to the toilet to answer the call of nature excuse me you're an adult go and do it yourself you're not a kid so you open the door for Shan to mess up with your head that's your problem nobody going to care about you at 10:00 we all go to bed or 11:00 depending uh uh we go to bed and sleep you're the one who's suffering you want to cure yourself there is a way but if you insist on overthinking and playing Shan's games you get ready to go down the drain big time"
