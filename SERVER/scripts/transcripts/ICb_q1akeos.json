  "transcript": "okay any okay why is it like this if it is what is the reason we like this uh then we do pressure so people this one to make the index finger uh in motion what is the okay okay i will answer it is from um bahrain he says when we pray for raka's or three raka's like in maghrib for example after the first shahood we stand up for the third and we raise our hands saying allahu akbar and in the shahood we move our index finger and shake it in his place saying why do we do these things your question is quite um always not that clear for me because why do you pray three raka's in maghrib and two in fajr and four in the rest of the day why not all the same you're going to say because allah ordered us to do so okay then why do we pray two raka's loudly in asia and two silently you say because this is how the the prophet did it allah did he justify it no did anyone justify it no it's a way of submitting your will to allah allah tells you to do something you say samia we listen we hear when we adhere and we obey so the same thing goes with raising the hands why do we initially raise the hands i don't know the prophet did it allah so we do it and it's exactly the same concept that umar said may allah be pleased with him when he was doing tawaf around the kaaba and he came to the black stone and he kissed it and he said to it had i not seen the prophet alaihis salatu kiss you i would have not have kissed you because i know that you're just a piece of rock that doesn't bear any benefit nor prevent any harm of course he's not talking to the stone he's talking to his followers congregation to understand the concept of why do we kiss the black stone to begin with this is the way that the prophet had taught us he told us learn from you me your rituals so we follow without any questions asked you"
