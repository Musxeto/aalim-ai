  "transcript": "buhari says we often see late comers to a masjid when they see the imam and the congregation in rukur they simply say allah even that they're not with the last row so they anywhere they are they just offer record is this permissible the answer is no and their prayer is invalid the prophet said alaihis meaning there is no prayer quote unquote accepted for an individual behind the row so if a person comes to a congregation to a masjid in the last row there are five empty places on the right five four places on the left and he chooses to make his own row at the end alone nobody's with him and makes his prayer and joins the congregation his prayer is invalid unlike if he came and the full row is packed there is no small space he can squeeze himself in in this case he has to implement fear allah to the best of your ability and the best of his ability is to pray alone and this is legit but to do this out of arrogance out of haste out of just wanting to catch the raqqa this is not permissible and allah azzawajal knows [Music] best"
