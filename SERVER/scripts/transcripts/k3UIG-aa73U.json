  "transcript": "Nafisa from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Can a broker tell the seller that the land is of less value and buy from him at a lower price and tell the buyer that the land is of more value and sell to him at a higher price? Is making profit this way just a bargaining or cheating? No, this is totally cheating and the money he makes out of it is haram. What he's doing is he's making profit unlawfully while deceiting people who trust him and this is not permissible in Islam."
