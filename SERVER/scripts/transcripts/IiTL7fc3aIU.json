  "transcript": "and we have muhammad from pakistan uh yeah my question was that my parents invested about ten thousand dollars in a business a couple of years back and they were getting profit from it which was variable so uh a few months back i took the took the money from them as a loan so i said to them that uh you were getting profit from their business so i will give you some money uh for supporting you uh but that won't be fixed so i also vary it but i give them around uh 100 or 150 dollars every month so my question is that is that ripa is their interest or if it is interest or if it is ripple how can i uh pay them to support them or something like that i will answer inshallah muhammad says he borrowed from his parents ten dollars which they used to invest and get return from this investment so now to compensate them he's giving them a monthly profit not fixed maybe sometimes 500 sometimes 300 sometimes a thousand so he says is this halal the answer is no if this is agreed upon this is totally prohibited if they're anticipating it is totally prohibited if you insinuate to them that this is in compensation for your loss in your investment which i've deprived you of again this is prohibited but if it's a gift and it's not on fixed monthly basis because then it would fall in their hearts that this is part of the investment and the profit that we are getting this if it's just a gift this is permissible generally speaking 99 this is not permissible for you to give them or for them to expect that"
