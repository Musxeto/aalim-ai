  "transcript": "as in Saudi Arabia tomorrow Feder time we will go back to the message with the grace of Allah zoella and his son used to pray in the message before the lockdown now he's afraid so what's the ruling on praying in the Masjid beginning tomorrow the major scholars council issued a fatwa a couple of days ago they said that those who are infected or afraid to infect others it's totally prohibited for them to attend so I have a cold I have a sore throat I'm coughing then I must not attend the prayer in the machine those who have issues so they have prop deficiency in their immune system and doctors are saying that those who are diabetic who have high blood pressure who have heart problems or stroke problems they should not attend the prayer not only the prayer they should not attend places with lots of people in because their possibility of being infected is far greater than others so those should not attend and thirdly they said whoever prays Gemara in his home he should pray it for Raqqa as it over and not as Juma now this is what they have issued so if your son is truly afraid he doesn't go to work he doesn't go to college he's confined to his home and he has a legitimate reason to fear meaning that he has immune deficiencies in this case we would to say that there is no problem he may pray at home because fear is one of the reasons to permit a Muslim from skipping praying in the Masjid but if he doesn't have any thing to be afraid of if he's young healthy and he's taking the personal protection gear or equipment the PPE so he's wearing the face mask he's using synthesizers he's keeping his social distancing and this issue of social distancing again I did not hear any sound fatwah for from the major scholars council yet there are fatwas from here and they're stating that you can pray and leaving this distance and some of it from the major scholars but they did not issue a combined factor till now I don't know why but for example chef Turkey Monsanto Heartland has issued a fatwa and and others stating that social distancing in the Masjid is permit permissible and now I'm at a fork of the road because I'm not qualified to give a fatwa and this one or two or three major scholars who had said that this is permissible it seems to me that we should pray rather than staying home if you don't have any reason to fear and having this gap though it is not from the Sunnah but due to it is a an issue relevant to a contemporary problem something that was not in the past so the scholars came up with solutions and they did their level best whether it's right or wrong this is something only allah azza wajal knows those who feel comfortable with this fact wa they should go and pray in the masjid instead of praying home and losing the reward those who still are hesitant and they are not at ease thinking that this might be an innovation and they have the right to think this until they hear a combined unified fatwa from the major scholars it's in this case and they pray home insha'Allah they are not sinful as well on Mars"
