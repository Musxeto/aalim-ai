  "title": "Depressed due to Duas not being answered due to my past sins, (positive and negative fears) assim",
  "transcript": "much sir. Like I have this problem that I've been thinking maybe it's because of my past things that Allah is delaying my prayers, my duas, and because maybe I have not been practicing Islam but it was not my fault. I had the opportunities to learn Arabic language but it was negative due to black magic. So I would like you to advise me in this situation because I'm a little bit depressed because of my situation sir. First of all, this fear of previous sins can be positive and can be negative. So if your fear from your previous sins cripples you and makes you stay where you are without advancing, without seeking knowledge, without seeking Allah's forgiveness, without doing good deeds, this is negative fear and it is from Shaytan. Positive fear is whenever you remember your previous sins, you get energetic to repent more, to seek Allah's forgiveness, to show your remorse, and to do good deeds. So it is a progressive fear, not a negative one. It makes you go forward and closer to Allah and closer to Jannah. So this is what you should have and this would relieve you from your depression inshallah."
