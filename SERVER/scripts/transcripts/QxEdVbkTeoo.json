  "transcript": "Bailey from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh if we say Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar each 10 times and then make dua then our dua get accepted. So before making dua between Azan Ikamah and Tahajjud should we say this? When? Before making dua like first time saying this dhikr and then making dua. No you should follow this dhikr is good but you have to also offer the salutation upon the Prophet as he said that dua is blocked between the heavens and the earth until you offer salutation upon me."
