  "title": "Is homeschooling a better option? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I says is homeschooling better nowadays as sending children to international schools carry the risk of them going astray because of peer pressure peer pressure is found everywhere even in the schools that is based on toffee of a Koran so even Islamic schools you will find P pressures however one should weigh the pros and cons so if they are at a very early stage and they need to learn the basics sending them to public schools might be acceptable but if there is a lot of Haram being involved and if they are girls for example which is far more dangerous than boys then in this case the parents have to weigh the pros and cons it is the responsibility of Muslims wherever they are in their community wherever which country they are in it is their responsibility to collaborate to build an Islamic school this is the most important thing to do because this is the nucleus of building and establishing a Muslim society if you send your kid and mine to a public school where there is music free mixing teaching them sexual education teaching them homosexuality is OK teaching them Darwin theory and evolution telling them that God does not exist and then you say what can I do lalala you can do a lot you can take your child out of this school period even if he doesn't study that's better than studying the wrong thing that would deviate him from the straight path of allah azza wajal would you like to see your son homosexual is it okay for you that your daughter has a boyfriend do you want to see any of them becoming an atheist so what to do you have to move the whole community is sinful when they save money to buy an LCD screen 50 inch or whatever or a home theater or a brand-new car or a bigger house when while they are not taking care of their own children and the children of the Muslims in their community this is a communal obligation look at who that evening for example how many families are watching learning benefitting how many families have been guided to the correct leader through the grace of Allah and then through Jota TV what did you do when you know that they are suffering financially all what it takes from you is what $10 a month is it a lot but nobody is paying nobody is giving so these are outlets that it's a communal obligation upon all of us to support them each his own right you cannot be a scholar but you can be a contributor with your with your money maybe you don't have money but you can contribute in marketing in graphic designing in web designing etc so the sky is the limit but again we fail to walk the talk when you have a Muslim community in London in Paris in Berlin in New York and they failed to pump money to build a school then you have a problem in there Islam when each one of us is only concerned of his own interest of his own wealth what have we done for Islam so is it is homeschooling better in the West I would highly recommend it in the present situation at the present time when you look at their public schools it's horrendous it is not something that a Muslim child can grow up in and hence Muslims must not do that to the best of their ability"
