  "title": "Husband lost interest in wife because she became 'too religous' & divorced her, advice",
  "transcript": "uh another issue with regards to marriage i think one of the questions that was shared by the participants was that a husband actually said that his wife was too boring because she adhered too much on religion and because of that he started having promiscuous relationships and then divorced her so what is your word of wisdom to the particular sister in this case she should be very happy alhamdulillah allah has saved her from such an evil person definitely he's not the partner she wants to have in in gender if she were ever too intelligent anyone who complains of adhering a lot to religion anyone who is bored of you wearing the hijab refusing to meet his brothers and and and in-laws refusing to engage with him and watching inappropriate movies or listening music he wants you to do what goes against your religion how can you love some such a person and this is again following sharia or whims and desires how do i evaluate my partner in life by the way they look no by the way they speak no by their commitment so no matter what shortcomings my spouse has her commitment to religion knowing my rights over her trying to serve me and to please me to the best of ability this is what increases the love in my heart the moment i feel agitated or frustrated or bored because i want to watch a movie and she doesn't want to sit with me and watch it with me this is a sign of corruption in my heart that i'm a hypocrite it's not sufficient for me to sin alone rather i'd like her to sing with me i would not be happy with such a person is a hypocrite and a sinner and she's way way better off without him and allah azzawajal would substitute her with someone much better insha allah in this life and in the hereafter we have reached the end of our third session of the conference please keep on sharing any perls of wisdom that you have gained throughout the session on your social media with the hashtag tsp2021 be steadfast we do have some live polling uh session going on in our telegram uh group chat so if you are in it please do um participate in our polls our fourth and final session tomorrow which is on the 28th of march 2021 will begin at 2 30 pm malaysian time inshallah"
