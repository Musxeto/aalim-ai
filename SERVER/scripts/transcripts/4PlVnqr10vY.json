  "transcript": "Abdul Hadi from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So Sheikh I have a question that recently my uncle went on Hajj and because he was on Hajj we usually meet every year on the second day of Eid but since he was on Hajj we're gonna meet on I think on the 28th and the problem is that whenever my entire family gathers in my uncle's house so there is no pre-mixing per se but when we go inside for example the non-mehrams they also aslam to other non-mehrams and then they segregate like for example the men go in another room and the females go in another room but non-mehrams do you know come in and go out and they might see each other so my question is can I go to this place if I only you know say aslam to my mehrams and don't talk to any non-mehrams and only sit with my male cousins no problem there is no problem in that inshallah you"
