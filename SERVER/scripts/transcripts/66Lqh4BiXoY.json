  "transcript": "from france she says is a person who is overwhelmed by whispers of shaytaan the shaitaan speaks on his tongue and he hears this this person curses and swears and says inappropriate things what to do i don't know if this person is forced to do these things then he is insane he cannot be classified as sane and no one can judge him except allah so if i speak in a different tongue and i curse and i swear and i step on the quran and i say blasphemous things and then i say whoa i didn't know i was doing this this is not me something is pushing me this person is possessed by jinn or he has black magic or he has something evil in him but who to judge him allah only allah knows if he's telling the truth or faking it up what to do i believe that the best course of action is to perform rookie so this guy if he's sane in conscience he should recite rookie on himself like multiple times during the day and the night makes a lot of dua in sujud and at the last third of the night and between adhan and akama at the times where allah answers your dua that allah cures him if he's unable to do that he should go to someone with sound akida a person who knows how to do rookie and to perform rookie on him asking allah azza for cure and healing allah"
