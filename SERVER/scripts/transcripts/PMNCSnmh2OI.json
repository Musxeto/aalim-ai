  "transcript": "Fouad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah So Sheikh, actually my question was Is it permissible to give a land for farming or rent? The rent will be a fixed amount on monthly or yearly basis? Jazak Allah Khairan Wa Jazakum There is no problem, none whatsoever in renting a plot or a farm or a piece of land that will be used for farming providing that they're farming something that is halal that they're growing something halal in exchange for a fixed amount of money so I'll give you my plot you give me $10,000 a month whether you grow something you don't grow something you keep it, you fail in harvesting this is not my job I'm giving you the plot, you can do whatever you want with it for this fixed amount of money this is totally halal and permissible"
