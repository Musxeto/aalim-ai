  "title": "Is YouTube earning halal on halal products if we give 10% to Muslim charity? assimalhakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "uh talal says a scholar from a certain country says that the earning of youtube becomes halal on halal products even if they are advertised in a haram way where there is showing off of girls and music he also says that if you still have any doubt you can give 10 percent of your earning in sadaqah is he right or not the answer is displayed and shown to us in surat chapter 5 in the very beginning collaborate and cooperate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate nor cooperate on sin and transgression this is a general statement any contribution from my side would be haram if i'm promoting haram so i have a youtube channel and it's not monetized with the grace of allah till now and people come and say why don't you monetize it you'll get a lot of money out of it i would say okay where is the money coming from is the money coming because my material is good they said no you could have porn and still the money would be pouring in so why why is the money coming in they say because you allowed monetization you allowed them to put advertisement and the advertisers pay youtube money and in return they pay you money so i said aha so who gives the green light he said you you're the owner if you want to monetize then they will put do i have any control on the ads that no there will be music there will be women not wearing the hijab there will be a lot of haram things rarely you will find something that is halal do i have any control over it said nope in this case i am the one who's pushing the button i'm the one who's blowing the whole place up i'm the suicide bomber as they say then i'll go straight to hell because it's my doing now if they were to enforce advertisements whether you like it or not this is a different issue and i hope it doesn't happen but if this happens in this case because the advertisements are shown and displayed whether you like it or not you can monetize it but it would be like interest money given to you on your bank account without your approval what to do i have no other source to invest to to deposit my money in a bank without them putting interest money on which is haram okay no problem keep the bank account take the interest and dispose of it in charity likewise take the money generated by the advertisements all of it and dispose of it in means of charity not to get closer to allah rather to cleanse your wealth from such haram money as for the scholar who said what he had said this is his opinion but opinions are cheaper by the dozen they they come and go not every person who gives fatwa who gives a an opinion falls under the rulings of the quran and sunnah this is common sense so the explanation i gave to you is crystal clear no advertisement would would mean no money so advertisement that haram would equal revenue and money you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know and understand that you are the cause of such haram advertisements and you're making money out of it giving 10 given 50 given 99.9 percent does not make it halal giving a hundred percent when it's come obligatory upon you to have these advertisements whether you like it or not that's a different issue and allah knows best"
