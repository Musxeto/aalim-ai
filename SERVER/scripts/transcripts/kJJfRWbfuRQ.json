  "transcript": "then we have muhammad from the u.s sheikh my question is in a scenario when i make wuzu and i prayed uh like uh zoho prayer then uh i was reciting something or i am doing some research on my phone and i fall asleep and when i woke up i know that i need to make a fresh urdu for the answer prayer but for some reason i totally forgot it and then prayed the answers and after finishing that like after offering salam or maybe little later i realized that i forgot to do in that case do i need to make urdu and pray again okay muhammad there is a difference between forgetting and for getting an impurity if i have an impurity on my clothes a cloth or a piece of my garment and i forgot about it and i prayed and after finishing prayer i remembered my prayer is valid but if i forgot to take major ritual impurity russell or i forgot to make wudu and i prayed i have to repeat all the prayers that i offered because this is a condition without it the prayer is invalid so if you forgot if you were mistaken as long as you did not perform mudu you have to pray all the prayers that you've missed because of that treason"
