  "transcript": "Ben from Bosnia uh since my country follows the Hani maab the feder is moved close to Sunrise specifically around 35 to 40 minutes before sunrise and the Adan is then cold so could I pray the sunna in my home before uh before the the answer the answer is yes once the fer is due and the break of dawn is recognized you can pray your Sunnah of f whether the aan is called or not so in hanafi countries that delay purposely the aan for 40 minutes or so you can pray your Sunnah and if you live far away from the Masjid you can also pray F and go back to sleep before thean is cold and you have to refrain from eating and drinking if you're fasting and you have to offer your Witter prayer if you are praying night prayer before the actual time of the break of dawn not according to the aan because we know that these guys are not following the way of the prophet"
