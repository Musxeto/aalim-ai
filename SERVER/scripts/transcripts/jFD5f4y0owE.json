  "transcript": "and finally she have from bangladesh uh i was wondering whether it is permissible to use a phone plan that gives unlimited text and calling okay so basically um [Music] shihab is asking about a mobile plan where they give you a particular number of a minutes and messages as a package but you have to pay a particular amount of money it seems to me that this is permissible because whether you use that or not this is up to you because if you exceed it you're going to pay more if you don't use it then it's the payment you have paid is way over the norm if you did not take this package 500 minutes a month would have costed you maybe twice the price but they're giving you a discount and incentive for you to participate in this prepaid or post paid regardless so it seems inshallah that this is permissible allah azza knows best"
