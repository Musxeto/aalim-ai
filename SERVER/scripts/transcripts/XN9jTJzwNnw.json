  "title": "ðŸ†• Chits, committee, & commission from money saving system halal? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "And the first question is from brother Zubair and he's asking about a that in his local area there's a very common financing method called chits. Group of people usually a family agree to pay a sum of money in installments to a facilitator so each month when everyone pays to the facilitator the money received will be given to a random participant hence making a loan facility to the poor but the facilitators receive extra installments from everyone for his service is this halal or haram so basically this is something that is done in communities I have 10 of my friends or 11 me being number 12 so for 12 months of the year we contribute a thousand rials for example or euros each one of us so the first month inevitably one will receive 11,000 because his thousand is included 12 the following month one of the remaining 11 would receive of course the first one who took halas will not receive anything till the end of the year but he will keep on paying 1,000 1,000 so that it would compensate for the 11,000 that he received in the beginning of the year so it's like a saving program you're actually taking what you put in in the previous months or the coming months but nothing extra nothing less now the thing is that some groups may not have the time to organize this so they appoint an external person a facilitator who would run the show for them so he would ensure to collect the money to call people where's the money you haven't sent it today is the second day of the month and then collects it and gives it to the designated one according to the schedule however for his services they give him something as a reward or a compensation for his efforts there's nothing wrong in that and this is halal inshallah and Allah knows best you"
