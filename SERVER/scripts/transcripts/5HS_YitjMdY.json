  "transcript": "the following hadith 277 277 page number 192 uh chapter \nthe contentment of the self   anna said i served the prophet sallallahu alaihi \nwasallam for 10 years he never said of to me and   he never said about something i had not done why \ndidn't you do that or something i had done why did   you do that authentic now this is a hadith which \nis well known in the sahih we all know it by heart   and this shows us the personality of the prophet \nsalallahu in commenting on this hadith i made only four pages believe it or not and i was thinking of tomorrow's \nlecture you can make a difference should i put it   until now i haven't decided it's i \nneed 24 hours before now it's 20 like 8   or 30. so it's not time yet for me to \nthink about either to have it on this topic   similar to it you can make a difference in your \nlife and the people's life on the personal level   or to expand it and talk about our difference \nthat we can make in the society in the ummah   can we make a difference in the level of the \nummah so until now not decide maybe hajj would   help me later on say this is a long topic very \nlong topic but i will not go through it because   we have to cover the material but i'll just give \nyou a hint if one of your employees does a mistake do you look the other way or interrogate \nhim this is a personal thing when your wife   does something wrong okay let's \nhelp the brothers when your   husband does something wrong do you nag on his \nhead and you remind him for the next 30 years   you've done this and this and this and this 30 \nyears ago why did you do this i tolerated you i   forgave you what forgave you're reminding me five \ntimes a day like prayer without adhan without a   comma every day five times a day you remind me of \nyour forgiveness what kind of forgiveness is this   this is a deficiency in our character the \nprophet is teaching us allah to do this   you remember yusuf they took him threw him in the \nwell he was imprisoned then he became the aziz   of masur they come to him he accuses \nhis younger brother so that he can   abduct him and take him in his custody \nof stealing and when they come and say   what happened they tell them that the younger \none stole because they found the measurement cup in his luggage what did they say well if he   had stolen it his brother had stolen \nbefore whom are they referring to yusuf   they accused him falsely falsely falsely \nof stealing what allah says in the quran he concealed it in himself and he did not react \nto it this beautiful characteristic is known as there's no word in my knowledge in \nenglish to explain it in arabic it means   looking the other way when something happens \ndo not investigate do not insist on finding why   move on if we deal like this we would be very \nhappy no problems in our marriages in our work   in our relationships when you look the other \nway so many examples so many beautiful things   it's not the time it's a separate lecture maybe \ntomorrow maybe not what did the prophet do is   this is how the prophet was whenever \nanas who was his servant for 10 years   who was a child he never complained \nwe have subordinates we have drivers   we have workers how do we deal with them the \nprophet said or ana said the prophet whenever he   looked at something i did he would \nnot reprimand me why did you do this   and if i did not do it he would not reprimand \nme by saying shouldn't you have done so and so   no the prophet islam let it go and \nthe people with high aspiration   would not repeat the same mistake twice when \ni do something wrong and my boss does not   talk to me about it i feel ashamed i know \nhe knows and next time i will not do it   because i don't want to bring this \nfeeling again and i don't want to make him lose hope in me in a sense now compare \nwhat we do with this hadith how many times   we talked to our wives why didn't you do this   why didn't you do that how many times i tell \nyou you have to do this put this in place   i know brothers that are taunting their wives \nwallahi when they come into the house i know   a brother who is a relative of mine the \nminute he comes to the house he does this and he looks at his wife with a scary look \nthis is sufficient why just pick it and   move there are people who make life difficult \nto others they question them they interrogate   them look at the beautiful hadith of the \nprophet ali o prophet of allah how many times   should we overlook and forgive the shortcomings \nof a servant is my servant so the man is asking   how many times what do you expect the \nprophet to say he said 70 times a day 70 mistakes a day is this logical this is islam \nlook the other way and things will rectify it   itself but when you insist on investigating why \ndid you do this this is wrong you should not have   done this i warned you before this causes friction \nand tension and life cannot go on like this well you"
