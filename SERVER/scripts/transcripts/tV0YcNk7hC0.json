  "title": "Is oral sex permissible in Islam?  | Answered by Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question was about oral sex and I cannot go into details of course but let it be known that in early religion it is prohibited for a person to touch his private parts while urinating it is prohibited to cleanse and purify yourself with your right hand after answering the call of nature whether urinating or defecating and the scholars say that this is obvious because Allah honors the right the left hand is to be used for dirty things so the right is honored in Islam now I ask you a question which is more honored your right hand that you eat with or your mouth that you say the Shahada with that you recite the Quran with that you say the name of allah azzawajal with to be used in such filthy things that we did not learn except from the kaffir even the dogs may not may not do this that the animals so the one should refrain from such filthy things"
