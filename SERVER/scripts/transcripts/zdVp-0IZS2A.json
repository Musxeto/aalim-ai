  "transcript": "Hassan from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah So my brothers have motorcycles and I use them to get food from the market that my mother told me to do And they don't object it but I had a habit of whenever I would go to market for food I would take multiple rounds across the society for no reasons And I used to do it almost every time, sometimes less rounds, sometimes a lot of rounds across the society And I have no idea how much petrol I have used doing unnecessary things back then I wish I never did it but do I have to pay for that? Do I have a debt like that? Usually such expenses, such transgression, such going over the limit in a permission that was awarded to you Is negligible and people due to their social norms and their kinship and their relationship to their siblings Don't care about extra rupees here and there that you may have spent or wasted against their will or without their knowledge Usually it's negligible so don't do it again because this is a breach of trust And had they known maybe they would have forgiven you, maybe they would have felt insulted for your betrayal So don't do it again but whatever was in the past move on and ignore it"
