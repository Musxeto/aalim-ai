  "title": "Am I sinful for not doing Tashahhud in 2nd Rakat of Witr if I follow the HANAFI Madhab assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Talha from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I follow the Hanafi Madhhab and in the Hanafi Madhhab they have like four Salatul Wudu and the second one they do the Tashahud I don't do the Tashahud because I heard from you that the Prophet prohibited it so if I do that would I be sinful because I'm not a layman, I'm not a mujtahid and I heard that a layman can't use hadith as evidence First of all, as a Muslim, you have to follow the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations of companions Tabi'een and Tabi'at Tabi'een and if you do that, you will be saved on the Day of Judgment if you're unable to do that due to the fact of you being a layman then you must follow a mujtahid or a scholar who does follow the Quran and the Sunnah with understanding of the three favorite generations providing that he is trustworthy, that he is morally correct he's modest, he doesn't change his opinions every now and then he's consistent and he's highly accredited by other practicing well-known scholars whether he's a Hanafi or a Shafi'i or a Maliki or a Hanbali, it doesn't matter what you have to follow is someone who adheres to the Quran and Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations following a school of thought like most people do without following a particular imam would put them in chaos because the books are in the thousands and in the same school of thought there are six or seven conflicting opinions so which one would I follow? you have to follow an imam now when it comes to witr, praying three rak'ahs like the Hanafis do while sitting in the second rak'ah like Maghrib this is what the Prophet ï·º prohibited however scholars say that if you're praying in a masjid led by a Hanafi imam who believes that what he's doing is kosher and legit there's no sin on you when you follow him and pray like he does because he's doing his own Ijtihad and you as a follower you're following your imam and Allah Azzawajal knows best you"
