  "title": "Buying Action Figures for Adults or Children? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum Just a quick question, what is the ruling on the nowadays many teenagers and adults are purchasing things like action figures, what is the ruling on that? If these teenagers are adults, this is totally haram, action figures is like buying a statue of Iron Man, Batman, Thor, Frog Man, Ant Man, whatever man they have. And if they are adults, this is prohibited for them. If they are children, it is permissible for children to play with such toys. However, I sincerely would advise parents and grown-ups not to allow their children to watch such nonsense and sometimes such filth. A couple of weeks ago, a child somewhere, I don't know in the UK, maybe in the US, saw a spider and he went to the spider so that the spider would bite him or sting him thinking that this would turn him into Spider-Man. This is what happens when we allow our children to watch such nonsense. Some children, I remember when I was young, used to jump from the balcony thinking that they're Superman and that they can fly. So such action figures based on American heroes or Pulp Fiction or the likes is not part of our religion nor our culture. When we bring up our children, and I unfortunately end up with some of my grandchildren coming home with a mask of Batman or Spider-Man and they've never seen the movies in their lives. But it's a craze, it's what everybody doing around them. So this is problematic. Where is your identity? Where is your pride of your Islam? Most of them, who is Osama Ibn Zayed, they wouldn't know. They wouldn't know who Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed is. They wouldn't know who Salah Ibn Al-Akwa is. Because they don't have any relationship to their history, to their heritage, to their dignity, the people that made them who they are. Therefore, I would say, again, adults, it's not permissible for them to buy action heroes. Children, be careful."
