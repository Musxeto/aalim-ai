  "transcript": "Farooq from Qatar okay so how many times must we watch those on them where the island adjusted to turn into the excusable so if you're asking about the number of times to wash a najasa of your sleeves for example there isn't any prescribed number of times you wash it as you please until it the mass itself is removed sometimes if you have a colored najasa you will have the mass removed but some of the color May remain and this is negligible as in the case of for example when you wash off feces traces of the underwear you may wash it three times with soap with water and you squeeze it and and still there remains some traces and color this is negligible women find the same problem when they wash off Menses blood the traces or the color May remain but the masses is gone so it is pure without any problem inshaallah foreign"
