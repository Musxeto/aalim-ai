I think I responded to your Salam So I want to pick up my dad from the airport by car In Sha Allah and it's the airport is in another city and it's about 130 kilometers away from here and I tried to find out what travel is considered as in the Urf but I couldn't find out so I want to ask if is this considered as travel?
