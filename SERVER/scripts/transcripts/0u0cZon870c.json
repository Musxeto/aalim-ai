  "transcript": "the Prophet ﷺ said shirk is the most grievous sin before Allah but some scholars say that kufr like not believing in Allah is worse so how to reconcile these statements? All of this is philosophical. Shirk and kufr are the same so shirk, kufr and nifaq, major shirk, kufr and nifaq they're all in hellfire and this prevents a person from entering paradise. Therefore if a person believes that there is no God existing, he's mushrik. At the same time he doesn't believe in God existing so how could he associate others with Allah? Because he's associating his own whims and desires and worshipping it. As Allah mentioned those who take their whims and desires God's beside Allah. So this is shirk and everyone who is a mushrik is a kafir disbelieving in Allah Azzawajal since they're almost the same in conclusion."
