  "transcript": "in modern day some people they pull water mouth and nose and then they with all the body so this russell was not at the time of crawford at the time of prophet the prophet first ablution and then they were body so this is not innovation to just pull water in mouth and nose and then with all the body what you have said brother muhammad is an observation that was not followed by any of the scholars of the schools of thought to my knowledge simply because the prophet al-islam had never told us follow this sequence in rusul and you will fail even if you look in all of the books of the sunnah that the prophet as islam said you have to first wash your hands three times wash your private part perform mudo then put three scoops of water on your scalp and ensure that never so when you come and boldly say that this is an innovation you cannot do the other form of russell who said that one cannot jump to conclusions out of thin air and think like that and say that this is halal and this is haram without evidence from the quran the sunnah otherwise a person might fall in a major sin as mentioned in ayah 33 chapter 7 surat al-araf to speak about allah without knowledge the prophet alaihis indicated in some hadith that spilled the water on your body that's awesome and the scholars stated that there are two types of russell the russell that we follow the way of the prophet hassam which was described not ordained not ordered to us it was described that he used to do this or to follow the other way of russell which is the linguistic part so what does russell in arabic means to wash your whole body boom i washed my whole body without the sequence any problem no problem where did we get swirling the water in the mouth and sniffing it and blowing it from our noses from the sunnah because it's part of the wood or part of the hustle that the prophet used to do ali that's it so be careful in what you say my friend you"
