  "title": "Father makes me sit with him for Khatam (food items for deceased)",
  "transcript": "Irfan from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wassalamu Alaikum So, in my family, on every Thursday and Friday, my father sends Sawaab of food items like sugar, dry fruits, etc. to the deceased and he forces me to sit with him and bring items for his Bida. And he said that if I won't sit with him, he will leave me. So can I sit with him? I don't understand your question. What does your father do? Don't participate in this gathering in the sense that saying Ameen or making Dua, but if he wants you just to sit with them and he does this on his own without you participating in the innovation or helping or endorsing it, there's no problem in that, Inshallah."
