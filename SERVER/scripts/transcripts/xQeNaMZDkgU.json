  "transcript": "fatima says is it permissible to do wudu during menses what if we want to do it before sleeping to follow the Sunnah the most authentic opinion and this is what the Shafi a school of thought imam never we spoke about and other schools of thought as well that this is not permissible a woman on her period must not perform moodle because first this is an innovation secondly it has no value so it's like praying tortas while in your menses this is not permissible one may argue and say ok tell me then why if a person is in his major ritual impurity meaning that he had intimacy with the missus and now he has to perform a suit and he wants to perform whistle after he goes to bed before waking up for Fechter so why do we make wudu the answer is because mother aisha told us that the Prophet as a son whenever he went to bed in the state of major ritual impurity he would break that or lessen it by performing what do to sleep so she says then why if a woman in her menses can't do the same we say that the woman can't do the same because the Woodill would not help her to pray even if she does but the person with the major ritual impurities period of impurity is minimal two hours four hours at most and then he will have to have a total bath hustle to pray while a woman in menses her would or would not help her to do anything unlike a person in his major ritual impurity his voodoo would lessen his in purity so that he can go to sleep and even that is not a must it's a confirmed Sunnah the Prophet awesome sometimes may have skipped it as in the hadith of Aisha may Allah be pleased with her so yes a woman in her menses must not perform Moodle before sleeping or for any other reason and Allah so she'll knows best this is"
