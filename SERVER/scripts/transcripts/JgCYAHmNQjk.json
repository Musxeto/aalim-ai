  "transcript": "Zane says can we make power on behalf of chronically ill parents or deceased people the Sunnah tells us that it is permissible to make Hajj or Tawaf Elbe del meaning this is on behalf of people so a person who had died one of my parents one of my ancestors one of my uncles one of my friends and I'd like to attribute aromara for his sake so that Allah would elevate his status and erase some of his sins I say Lebec allah humma humma and I go no problem in that I'd like to perform Hajj the Baker Lahoma Hajj on behalf of so-and-so and I go no problem in that path is a form of a bada like fasting it's like praying in order to accredit the reward to a deceased I have to have an evidence from the Quran and Sunnah saying that this is permissible and because I don't have this scholars say that performing tawaf on behalf of a deceased person or chronically ill or someone who's healthy is totally prohibited because it is not mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah so share can't we cascade the permission to perform Umrah and hatch on behalf of a deceased also to tower of the answer is no because Tawaf was there at the time of the Prophet a little ofsome and he never directed people to do it on behalf of others likewise reciting the Quran can we recite the Quran on behalf of deceased and give them the reward - there is no or an was there and the profit had never told the people to recite Quran for their deceased or when they visit a graveyard this is one of the big innovations in the Muslim world they go to the graveyard and they raised their hands and recite al-fatiha we are at a gathering and they say Allah Akbar last year our brother Abdullah used to create era with us in the Masjid now he's dead al-fatiha o people and everybody starts with what are you doing so reciting the Fatiha it's the most important and the greatest surah in the Quran I know that but why are you doing it for the deceased so you'll give him Baraka give him reward do you have any evidence from the Quran Sunnah dancers No then this is an innovation and likewise when people get married so we go and propose to this girl's family and say we would like to give our a son to your daughter or your daughter to our son and it would be a blessing and they said we accept in sha allah let's recite the fatiha why are you setting the fatiha so it's for Baraka Baraka Annie are you thinking that he is dying like the one in the grave that's why we is at fatiha at the graveyard and we recite Fatiha when a person is getting married what is this although this is an innovation reciting surah he has seen and giving it to the deceased is an innovation sure horizontal or an yeah I know the set in Quran it's a good deed for yourself you're getting the word but you cannot simply sign it off to someone else I credit it to someone else this is not for you you cannot simply pray six records and said okay I'll take two rakahs and for ACCA's waiver that to my disease the father or mother this is not part of the Sun at all"
