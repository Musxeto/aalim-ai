  "transcript": "Adnan from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh can you explain the hadith which says cursing a Muslim is wicked and killing him is kufr so does this include all small fights between Muslims moreover does this mean verbal fight or physical fights the hadith states Sibabul mu'mini fusuq wa qitaluhu kufr swearing and saying vulgar words when fighting this is sinful this is fusq and fighting a Muslim whether you kill him or not just the intention of fighting him and harming him this is kufr which is minor disbelief not the major disbelief that would take a person out of the fold of Islam this is the aqeedah of ahlus sunnah wal jamaah backed up by the Quran if two factions of the believers were to fight against one another then you have to try to arbitrate between them Allah described them as believers factions of the believers though they were fighting and waging war against one another this did not take them out of the fold of Islam so this is how we understand the hadith and the rest of the verses of the Quran by combining them and trying to reconcile so yes when I fight with a brother when I have a dispute and he said oh you're stupid no you're dumb you're this you're retard this exchange of verbal abuse swearing and cursing and saying bad words this is fusq this is sinful and shameful act so I hope this answers your question"
