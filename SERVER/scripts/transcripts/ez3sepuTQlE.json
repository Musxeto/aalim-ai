  "transcript": "So Islam has nothing to do with arts, \nmovies, songs, it's different, it has nothing   to do with entertainment, with liquor, with \nnightclubs, it has nothing to do with politics,   with joining hands with the enemies of \nIslam and taking them as best friends and   making the Muslims enemies of us because \nthey don't share their point of view with us,   this is not Islam, this is a different religion,   yes you make call it whatever religion you want \nbut do not attribute this to Islam people that   who are not known to be among the worshippers \namong those who pray and fast and do righteous   deeds and have scholars that they refer to, \nyou must not listen to them when they try to   do what they're doing to your religion and to the \nSunnah of the Prophet ﷺ maybe tomorrow we will   conclude Insha Allah with this topic \nabout the basics of the Sunnah, but   I think we need to elaborate \na little bit more on that,   so we will take a short break and be right \nback to take your questions Insha Allah."
