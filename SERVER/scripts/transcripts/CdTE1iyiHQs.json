  "title": "Making up years of missed prayers? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "i have left my salah for three years when i was ignorant now i am practicing my deen alhamdulillah do i need to redo my prayers for three years no you don't because it won't be accepted from you and we always give the example of hajj if someone came five days late or for hajj and he goes to arafah on his own and stays in the whole place and not a single person is in sight so the police comes and say what are you doing here he said i'm performing hajj i said yeah but arafah was five days ago and you missed that he said yeah yeah i was caught up due to problems with my visa and the immigration did not release me except today so i'm making it up we said no you cannot make it up arafah is on the ninth of the hijab period you miss that day you miss hajj you have a possibility next year to do another hajj likewise allah mentions in suratul that prayer is time bound so if the time if you pray before time for example fajr if you pray fajr before the break of dawn your prayer is invalid and if you pray fajr after sunrise your prayer is invalid you have to pray within the interval so if you missed it for three years no you cannot make up any single prayer just repent ask allah for forgiveness offer a lot of night prayer voluntary prayers and never miss up a prayer and inshallah allah will forgive"
