  "transcript": "smell Ahana vehement hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa borussia rahmatan lil adenine sayidina muhammadin wa ala aalihi wasabi Romany today we had a westerner bassoon neti Hirayama Dini Bardot assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh women around the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as soon as you hear this title one of the first names that pops up is the name of our mother our beloved mother who was the love of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the most beloved of his wives that he declared that he loves her more than anyone else her name was aisha may allah be pleased with her his her father's name was abu bakr as-siddiq even a biack Ahava abu bakr's name was abdullah and his father's name was earth man but they were known for their nicknames so everybody knows abu bakr the son of a bi hoffa and her mother was OMA oh man the daughter of an alkene ania aha assha had many names and her nick name was um Abdullah Abdullah Omar Abdullah though she did not have any of her own offspring but her sister asma bint ABI bakr may allah be pleased with them had a sister was married to az-zubair even Allah WA and she had a son by the name of abdullah IBN az-zubair who was one of the Companions as well so she loved her nephew he loved her nephew so she was called um Abdullah because of her taking care of him and the Prophet approved that Alice a lot of Sarah she was also known as a sadirah because her father was a so deep the most truthful the one that believes she was also known as um Wilmot minene and that was her title to all of the companions and all those who followed afterwards because she was the prophets sallallahu alayhi assalam wife in this life and she is his wife in paradise as well she was also known as different names that the Prophet used to call her Ali Saleh to son so whenever he was joyful and happy with her he would call her yeah ish in in Arabic this is known as a to him not saying the full word not saying the full name so he was he used to say ya ish also he used to call her as I'll move off the one whose guide Lee and successful she's guided to know the right answer and sometimes he would call her the daughter of Sadiq or the daughter of ABI bakr and this is to uplift her status among the others because being attributed to such a mountain as abu bakr or asada is an honor by itself also the Prophet used to Nick named her as a Yamaha and she was called a Yamaha due to the fact that she was white and had some redness in her because due to her whiteness so the Prophet used to say from this album era when was she born she was born seven years before the Hedra from Mecca to Medina so she was born in Mecca and she noticed all the suffering and the trouble the Muslims had encountered in Mecca she was born to a Muslim family so she opened her eyes to find her father mother siblings all accepting Islam and practicing it and she spent nine years of her life in her father's house and the other nine years were in the prophets house alayhi salatu was-salam when we spoke about soda we talked about what had happened to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam after the death of his beloved wife Khadijah and how Allah been to Hakeem came to the Prophet Alison proposing that he gets married and she told him that there are two candidates a virgin and a nun virgin and the virgin was aisha bint ABI bakr so the prophet alayhi salaatu sam delegated the mission to hala to go and check whether they accept his proposal or not when how they went to own a Roman the mother of Aisha she was overwhelmed with happiness because this is an honor second to none but she understood that such a decision can only be made by the father who is the guardian and Abu Bakr was not in the house so she asked how Allah to wait until Abu Bakr comes when Abubakr came he had a problem the problem was that I was already engaged though she was six years of age she was already engaged to someone else Jubei a turban in what time will be no idea who was at the time not a Muslim so he could not go back on his word so he had to go and speak to them and motohama her ID who was an idol worshiper did not like Islam so he asked Abu Bakr if my son marries your daughter would she brainwash him and call him to this religion I don't want such a marriage so Abu Bakr was happy that he broke the engagement from his side and not from Abu Bakr side and he went and accepted the proposal and the marriage contract was conducted one would argue and say how can a six year old child get married and we spoke about this so many times that nowadays this sounds very awkward and inappropriate at that time it was the norm so she was engaged before the Prophet a son proposed which was the norm the prophet's mother as you remember got married when she was 13 years of age that was the norm even the enemies of Islam at that time among the idol worshippers the Jews the Christians you call them you name them they're there not a single one ever criticized the Prophet Allison for marrying quote/unquote a child women or girls in Arabia blossom early so yes she might may have the mentality of a child but she has the physique and the ability to be a good obedient wife and would be happy to serve the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam any couple would care for their daughter the most and it would be on the top of their list is to give her to a righteous man who would take care of her and who could take care of Ayesha better than the Prophet had a solid Westerner it's an investment in this life and the hereafter that nothing can compare to it and not only that was it forced upon our Asia did she resent it did she fight back or resisted the Prophet was the love of her life and she was his love and the favorite of them all she was the daughter of his best friend and no one could come close to Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him so the Prophet wanted to strengthen the bound between them and above all of this this was a revelation from Allah so it was an order from Allah for him to marry her the Prophet Ali salat wa sallam said to Asia I saw you in a vision twice being carried in a cloth of silk and the man carrying you was gibreel dark angel and he used and he told me twice this is your wife so I would unveil your face and it was you so I said if this is from Allah it will go through and we all know that the vision the visions of the prophets are ye a revelation if you read the quran ibraheem said to his man in his son oh my son i see in a dream in a vision that i am slaughtering you so tell me what should i do and his men said oh allah this is o my father this is command from allah do what you're told so this is a vision it's a revelation so his marriage to aisha was a revelation from allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala an order a command now they got married so she'd spent three years of her life in her father's house the marriage was not consummated until she became nine years old when they migrated to Medina and the Prophet used to go to her mother and always remind her to take good care of Aisha because the Prophet loved that joyful girl she wasn't like any other woman or any other girl she was the daughter of his best friend she was born a Muslim and she had attributes and characteristics in her that were not any other woman the prophet alayhi salatu salam was wise he used to deal and treat with her with kindness he realized that she was still a child so he would never stop her from playing with her dolls or getting her mates to come in the house and play together like girls usually do though her mates used to be afraid of the Prophet Isis I'm out of respect so the Prophet used to send to them come and play with Aisha and he would leave the house he would joke with her and play with her whenever he sees her dolls he asks her what are these and she says these are my daughters and when he saw a horse with wings he said what is this she said well it's a horse with wings and he said how is that possible and she said to him didn't you know that Sulaiman peace be upon him had horses with wings that could fly so the Prophet laughed and smiled until she could see his moral teeth he would give her credit being who she was she narrates to us that the Prophet once told her oh Sh would you like to see the Abyssinians practice and play with their spears in the message so she said yes so the Prophet lowered his shoulder to her as if he's sitting on the ground and she placed her head on his shoulder his body covering her and she was watching the Abyssinians play with the spears it was the Prophet who initiated this because he knows that a young girl need to play need to have fun and this is why she said at the end of the hadith therefore whenever you see a young girl always pay attention to her age don't put so many responsibilities and this is what we usually fail in doing we place a lot of responsibilities on children and we reprimand them we scold them you shouldn't have done that you're a big man now you're a big woman you should have done this in that and not paying attention to their mental state their actual age the way they think they need to play they need to be entertained so one has to balance these things so that he would have the best of all results now Aisha had a very special place in the prophets heart alayhi salatu was-salam I'm Rob MELAS may Allah be pleased with him he said the Prophet once appointed me as a leader over an army and before setting off I came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and i said o prophet of allah who is the most beloved person to your heart among all people amber says I thought that he would say you because since I accepted Islam whenever I came in the Prophet used to smile in my face and let me sit beside him so I thought maybe I have some degree of love in the heart of the Prophet I saw cinema towards me so the Prophet said in answering his question yeah she's the most beloved person on earth to my heart so AMRO rephrased the question said no no I meant from amongst the men so he said Abu Bakr her father so I assure was the love of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam and there was no mistake in that everybody knew that to the extent that the people the companions whenever they wanted to give the Prophet as some a gift some food some clothes anything that they wanted it to be a source of getting closer to Allah so they give him something we all know that the Prophet as Sam was the poorest of them all he had nothing and whatever came to him he gave to the poor and this is his lifestyle it wasn't a period of time he never lived in mansions he never had anything extra he always had one or two pieces of garment that he wore because he was given the choice and his wives accepted his style of living because they wanted paradise and not this dunya so whatever people gave gifts they felt sorry for the Prophet Oh Sam it doesn't have food mother Aisha says we lived in difficult times we used to see the Crescent following the Crescent following the Crescent meaning three meaning two months consecutive months and fire would not be lit in all the houses of the Prophet Oh Sam they would not cook because they had nothing to cook so the people loved the Prophet as-salaam and used to send him gifts however they would only send him gifts when he was in Ash's house when it was a Isha's turn so the wives of the Prophet is some complained to him and they said this is not fair you should order the people to be fair and to give you gifts whenever you are wherever you are not only when you are at ayissha's house and they complain to fatima his son his daughter so so she went to him and said Oh father your wives are complaining and asking you to be fair when it comes in regard in regards excuse me getting old Angela and it were fasting we don't have any water or coffee or tea and Howard Hamed Allah and the Prophet has spent two months without food being cooked in his house and we're complaining that we don't have tea or coffee or water what kind of Muslims are we may Allah's ocean have food upon us all so in short Fatima went and said they are asking me to remind you to be fair so the Prophet said to her alehissallaam Oh Fatima oh my daughter wouldn't you love what I love immediately she said of course father so he told her I love her so love her end of story the Prophet loves Aisha he's fair he's just but the feeling that he has in his heart he cannot control and he's not blamed for that so the people knew that Aisha saw gibreel in the form of a man talking to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and she said who was that man you were talking to and the Prophet said you saw him she said yes he looked like the hill Kelby may Allah be pleased with him a companion he said to her that was gibreel and later on Gabriel came and said o prophet of Allah give Salam to Aisha so he said Aisha gibreel is giving you Salam and she said I think alayhis salaam wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh you see what we don't see o prophet of allah she had many blessings on the ummah once she lost a necklace the prophet sent companions to look for it they were late it was a sir time they did not have water so they prayed as they were no water nothing no boodle and they came and told the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they did not know what to do allah revealed the verses of TM mum dry ablution who say them nay may Allah be pleased with him said may Allah reward you the family of Abu Bakr by Allah no incident that comes out from you except Allah would make a way out for the Muslims and it would be a blessing from Allah upon the Muslims the prophet alayhi salat wa salam used to look up to the day of fatima to the day of our issue so that he would go to her and every day he used to ask where am i tomorrow whose turn is it tomorrow especially when he got sick when he got sick they would attend him his wives each one in her home but the following day he has to be carried to the other wife's house and she would take care of him so every time he would say whose house am i going to tomorrow and the wives understood that he was looking for the wife for the night of Aisha as he felt comfortable being nursed well actually being looked after in her house when they realized this fact they all agreed with acceptance and consent that he stays all nights in her house without them claiming they're right in having him in their houses and when the Prophet knew that issue says he felt comfortable and relaxed because now he will be spending the night all of them and being looked after by Aisha and Aisha boasts about the fact that the Prophet Allah thought of salaam died while leaning on her chest putting his head on her chest before between her neck and chest and he passed away while being on her chest saying Marah vehicle Allah so this is an honor next to nothing and she says that the last thing that the saliva of the Prophet Allah saw son was mixed with was my saliva when my brother came with a miswak and the prophet saw it and he was so tired to speak so I noticed that in his eye the love between them makes her understand by just the mere look on his face so she said to him would you like that miswak and he nodded his head so she took the miswak she softened it with her teeth so it was mixed with her saliva and then she gave it to the Prophet as salaam who went and used that in his mouth so his saliva was lastly mixed with her saliva and she died on her chest may allah be pleased with her i sure was not like any other woman she was so generous yet she was so poor she gave everything she had kept nothing be back um Dora says of the liveness zubayr sent to Aisha his aunt a hundred thousand dirham a lot of money so she called for a plate she poured it in and she started spreading it among the poor and the needy of medina until it was all out and she was fasting so when it was market time she said to her mate give us some food so that we can break her fast and the maid said may Allah have mercy on you my mother wouldn't you have kept one dirham or two that we could have bought some meat you can break your fast on on it and she said to her don't reprimand me if you would have reminded me I would have done that but I did not have this in mind I did not think of that and Allah says Aisha was the most knowledgeable of all people and the most with thick meaning of understanding of issues and the best of opinions of all people and if you look at her life you would find that when people ask her about would answer tough sear she would answer hadith she would narrate hadiths more than anyone else other than maybe a before Allah and maybe anis and if you look at poetry she knows all the Arabs poetry if you look at medicine she even knows medicine and when she was asked by her nephew how would you know all of these things she said I was always with the Prophet House of Salaam and whenever he got sick I can hear the nomads saying to him that this plant is good for this and that plant is good for that so she had an edge without any dispute now scholars went into who's more favorable who's more beloved who's best who's better is it hadisha or fatima or Asha and the most authentic opinion is that this is with Allah we cannot judge these things though we are a little bit inclined to hadiza because she is the mistress of the women in paradise but when it comes to knowledge without any doubt aisha is more knowledgeable than all of them when it comes to lineage without any doubt Fatima has the highest of all in lineage and when it comes to the favors that she had given in the support and assistance to Muslims and Islam and especially to the prophet Isaiah sanam no one stands close to Khadijah so aisha gave the whole Muslim world a lot of knowledge that till date we depend on it and the reasons behind that were that she was very smart and she had a strong photographic memory she memorized the Quran she memorized the hadith of the Prophet of Salaam and she had the understanding the intellect to analyze and get the rulings from she was an expert in poetry in Arabic language in all the different arts related to it so she had the full arsenal to understand Quran and the Sunna and what was going on she grew up in the house of the Prophet erase a lot of sin and that would be sufficient just to see him to speak to him and if you add to that that the Prophet was also keen on teaching her on talking with her and making in making her understand because he knew that she would convey all of this to his Ummah and lastly she was the only wife of the Prophet Isis and that the revelation the way from gibreel came while the Prophet was with her in the bed and he said that no other woman ever had I received the revelation while I was her bad except Aisha and the Companions themselves acknowledged her knowledge abu musa al-ashari says whenever we had a dispute among us companions of the prophet harris asana we would always ask and find that she has knowledge about it imagine this great mother of ours she's our mother she's not only the wife of the Prophet she is the mother of the believers almost 200 companions and tabi took knowledge from her those who were Muharram like Rubens zubayr Al Qasimi Muhammad Ali Bakr those who were her nephews took knowledge directly from her those who were non Muharram she would teach them and address them in a special chamber where there is a hijab between her and them and they would learn and spread the knowledge over almost 200 companions learned from her aunt a pain and no wonder that whenever her name is mentioned we always remember that she was the love of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam that she was the hemara whom the prophet loved more than anyone else and that she is his wife in this dunya and she is his wife in Paradise and may allah azza wajal curse those who slander her who say negative things about her who resent her and hate her because those who do so hate our prophet alayhi salatu salam hate our religion and falsify the Quran where Allah has revealed her innocence in Surat and nor hada Allahu Alem when his paternal allele in Islam was allahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why early he was happy here as mine"
