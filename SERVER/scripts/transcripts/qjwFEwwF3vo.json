  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh you are getting \nyounger so you think this is I think true sheikh   uh Sheikh my question is I saw a lot of your \nvideos about people who are shy and introvert   but my question is uh there are some people who \nare introverted but they are not shy like I am   introverted but I am free to talk about my Deen \nto anyone who comes to me or sometimes I do some   dawah stuff with my brothers so being introverted \nlike for staying alone and trying to be alone is   it a disliked in Islam I just want to the Prophet \n(Peace and Blessing Upon Him) said a believer   who mixes with others and tolerates their \nabuse is better than a Believer who does   not mix with others and does not tolerate \ntheir abuse so being an introvert is not   something that is praised in Islam because \nif you have a person who's an introvert   and does not mix with people and does not give \nthem dawah and does not go out of his way to teach   people and to enforce virtue and righteousness and \nforbid evil and vice while person B does all of   that who's greater in reward of course a person \nB so you have to train yourself in practice now   I'm not saying that you have to be a social person \nand be out of your home 24 hours seven days a week   for that you have to balance like the Prophet \n(Peace and Blessing Upon Him) used to balance   you don't have to speak all the time like \na public speaker whenever you are give   speeches and dawa Etc no the Prophet \n(Peace and Blessing Upon Him) used to be silent most of the time but when he spoke   gems came out of his mouth so you should do the \nsame and inshallah you'll be on the right track and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
