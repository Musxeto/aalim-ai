  "transcript": "latifah from the usa says um the question is not clear to me but i'll give you scenarios and i hope it fits one that answers your question the government gives us grants gives us loan gives us money without asking us to return it back to them what's the ruling on taking and accepting this money this is halal the money sheikh is generated from lottery uh income because the government runs a lottery game and they make like 500 millions and they give a prize of 300 and they consume 200 million so they're giving us these grants from such games which are which is haram gambling no problem taking such a grant is halal for you the government is giving us this grant from the income tax so the tax department uh the irs or whatever is the one who collects taxes from the people and they are giving us through the instruction of the government a grant can i no problem and if this is not a grant if it's a loan that you have to repay if there is interest in it even if it's one percent interest or if they say that you're obliged to pay it back only when your income is above twenty thousand dollars a year or thirty thousand dollars a year this is riba and it's not permissible for you to take so if there are no strings attached and it's a grant regardless of the income or where it came from there's no problem in accepting that and allah knows best"
