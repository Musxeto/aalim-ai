  "transcript": "Ateeb from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh I have a question I heard that the asil of asking other than Allah is haram and I read a hadith that a person will keep begging and on the day of judgment he will come without any flesh on his face can you give some tafaseer on this hadith and this asil Sheikh? No this is not true it is permissible to ask people for what they can help you and assist you in what is not permissible is to ask of humans what only Allah can do so to ask someone to cure a chronic illness and he is not a professional medical doctor or someone knowledgeable to ask someone to enable you to walk on water or to fly in the air where no one can do this except Allah Azza wa Jal for you to ask someone to prolong your life and not to die this is only in Allah's hands to ask someone to admit you to Jannah or to forgive your sins which only Allah can do this but to ask someone to help you carry or prepare your tea the prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam used to send his companions to bring and fetch for him sweet water from far places because sweet water was rarely available in Medina the prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam took the assistance of a idol worshipper when he migrated from Mecca to Medina because he was kharit someone knowledgeable of the tracks and the routes to Medina so he hired him from Bani Dal and he took him and Abu Bakr around the places this is not haram however it is best not to ask people when you can be self sufficient so the prophet took the pledge of allegiance from his companions to obey and to adhere and not to ask people meaning that if one of them was on his ride on his camel and his whip falls he would dismount his camel and take it from the ground and go back again rather than ask people to hand it to him this shows you the dignity and honor a Muslim should have not that it is prohibited but it is a higher level of being independent and only dependent on Allah azza wa jal"
