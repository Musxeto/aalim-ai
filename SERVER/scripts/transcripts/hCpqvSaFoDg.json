  "transcript": "Raqib from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is in the past if the surface had dried up purity I used to spread a prayer mat over that surface and lay on the prayer mat. My prayers ended and I did not want to do that. Akhi I cannot understand your question Raqib. You're speaking from a well. Can you hear me Sheikh? I can hear you but the line is not clear. So I could not understand a single word of what you had said. Sheikh I was saying that in the past if the surface had dried up in purity I used to spread a prayer mat over that surface and lay on the prayer mat. Are my prayers valid and if not what did you do? So if I understand your question correctly there is a dried impurity on the ground and you place your prayer mat on top of that place and you pray. So what you're praying on actually is a pure clean prayer mat. Is your prayer valid? The answer is definitely yes it is valid. Ishaq from India. So Sheikh the company that I work for allows me to work and to be honest there isn't a lot of work that comes in but whenever there are tasks that I'm around with I try to complete it in a timely manner without any delay. So if there is no work for me to do is it okay if I take short naps or do other stuff at home or will that make my income haram or should I spend the entire nine hour shift in front of the system?"
