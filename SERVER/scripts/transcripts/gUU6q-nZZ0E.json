  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Canada My question is Sheikh \nthat I read somewhere that if a woman claims   that she was raped and she's not able to \ncome up with the four Witnesses and so and   and she gets the punishment according \nto uh if she's made or not flogging or   spawning is this a true or not is this \nhypothetical or a case that is existing   uh I have read that it's like so probably like a \nhypothetical scenario okay well what's the what's   the reason so usually this is what happens \npeople post something that's hypothetical   and then all of a sudden we have two teams \ntwo parties one defending the opinion   and the other bashing Islam and \nsaying bad things about Islam   and the original person who posted this is getting \nall the sins why did you ask such a question   nothing serious I just thought of you know \nsteering the water a little bit and and doing this   and watching what happens so watch out not to open \nthe Pandora box watch out not to open the pandora   box, watch out not to open something that would \nbe fitna for others now because you've posted the   question already whether you get the sin or not \nthis is not to me to uh state but I'll answer you   a woman comes forward stating that \nthis man has raped me so the forensic   uh um services or whatever the police or come \nand investigate medical reports they she has been   violated and raped do we have any DNA proofs \nEtc we may we may not now to the Muslim judge   I have a woman with medical reports or without \nclaiming that this individual has raped her   I bring this individual and say did \nyou he said no but she said you did   he says no and by the way she \ntook two million dollars from me   did you take two million dollars from him she says \nno said well touche so it's her word against his   why would I believe her when she's \naccusing someone and this one   we don't have evidences so what evidences do \nyou want chick we need four male Witnesses   to testify and and say that we've witnessed \nit this is not possible Sheikh okay then we   need him to confess he's not going to confess \nso how would I allow this to happen and accuse   this innocent man who could be innocent \nand he could not okay we have DNA test   that proves that he committed something like that \nin this case the Muslim judge puts him in jail uh   tries to pressure him until he confesses or put \nhim in jail indefinitely six 10 years 20 years   because we have DNA tests but DNA \ntest is not sufficient evidence   to Stone him to death or to flog him a hundred \nlashes these are circumstantial evidences   but if there is no DNA and there is \nno proof except her word against his   they he has the right to say Sheikh she \nslandered me I'm an honest law-abiding citizen   I'm the Imam of the Masjid I have children I have \na wife I have a family and she accused me out of   thin air no evidence is nothing no Witnesses in \nthis case this woman who claimed something and   could not prove it would be flogged 80 lashes \nfor her slandering an innocent person but she   was raped that's what you say prove it to me I \ncan't come to someone who claims that your father   raped her and do this process and you wouldn't \neven accept it oh my father doesn't do any such   thing just because a random person came and \naccused him of that I hope this makes sense"
