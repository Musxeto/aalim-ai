  "transcript": "consider subscribing uh tanha from pakistan uh one or two months ago i call you i say that to me and my husband for naked people marries i say that we repent and we stop fornication i also got my period pedestal talk to each other you say that as long as we repent and stop fornication our marriage is valid but for communicating we are sinful now i have it out and i need a help now on that time we realized that this is a sin and we don't want to end up in the health we want to stop this sin but we are so weak so we decided to get married we think that marriage can help us to stop this sin we saw fornication three or four months before marriage but we are still dating and don't stop seeing each other though we stop fornication physically but we talked about intercourse since it was long time ago i just can't remember we asked allah to help us to live this scene before marriage but don't want to do this in any because we don't want to do this sin anymore but we don't ask allah to forgive us the remorse we are feeling now and how we ask the love to forgive us now on that time we just say help us to live this sin we don't wanna do this before marriage and we don't wanna end up in hell but don't feel the remorse as we are feeling now now i don't know our marriage is valid or not so basically basically you want to divorce your husband no i don't then why are you coming up with these nonsense you've repented you've stopped fornication for four months and still you are thinking that is my marriage valid or not do you want me to say it's not valid you have to leave him no then stop and don't ask ever about this issue you will one day fall in the hands of a mufti who will say you're living in hunna you're living in zina you can't be with him all of your children are born out of wedlock would you like this no i answered you before why are you doing this again and again are you enjoying torturing yourself and your husband and your family no then stop your marriage is valid understood yeah thank you from pakistan we've addressed this issue and i have this hundreds of times a month women coming over and over and over doubting whether the marriage is valid or not men doubting their marriage is valid or not they repeat the marriage and they repeat it a third time and a fourth time and they keep on insisting that maybe it's not valid maybe we are living in zina we living in haram all of these are whispers from shaytan the sad part is that they keep on knocking on the same door and if the sheikh tells them your marriage is valid there's nothing wrong in it they go to another sheikh until they reach one sheikh who would say no your marriage is invalid you're living in haram your children are born out of wedlock now they go back to sheikh number one they knock on the door sheikh we are sorry but i know you gave us fatwa 600 times before now this sheikh says our marriage is invalid so what's your take on that then you will be in trouble because most likely the first sheikh would say i have nothing to do with you yeah but please help us we will do whatever you want no no can do you've exhausted your lives in the game now it's game over this is what you get when you keep on insisting in opening this kind of warms if you open it you'll get only a warms and they will disturb your life you're insisting it for it because shaytan is overtaking your mind and messing up with your head big time you get what you deserve the sheikh told you and gave you the fatwa your marriage is valid it's in on him move on with your life no no no no i just want to destroy my marriage i want to get a divorce and then they said no no we don't want to get a divorce they start crying such people need shock therapy slap on the face metaphorically because slapping the face is haram to wake them up and to see the gravity of what they're doing while they're in the process of destroying their own marriages you"
