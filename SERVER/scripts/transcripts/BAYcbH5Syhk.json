  "title": "Can women pray with feet uncovered? (Hadith) | AssimAlHakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Bangladesh. He says; 'Is \nthere any hadith stating that a woman can   uncover her foot or her feet?' And I think \nhe's referring to Salat. This is an issue of   dispute. The Hanafi school of thought say that, \nit's okay to pray while exposing a woman's foot   up to the ankles. And some scholars agree to \nthat. And we follow the safest opinion, which   was given to us by the Prophet, \n'alayhi salatu wa salam, when he   told us that 'A woman's body in salat is \nall 'awrah except her face and her hands.'   And all the schools of thought agree on this. \nWhen it comes to the technicality of her praying   in home, some, like the Hanafi school of thought \nand also Sheikh ibn Taymiyyah, others say that,   this is exempted, this is permissible because \ntheir attire at homes was not always covering   their feet. But this is a logical explanation, not \na technical, backed up with evidence explanation.   And therefore, to be safe is far better than \nbeing sorry. And the problem is that these people   who permit her to pray with her feet uncovered, \nthey even go an extra mile and say, 'Okay she can   also go out with her feet uncovered and mahrams \ncan look at her feet.' And this has no limits.   'To where exactly? Only the ankles? What about \nif it's like a couple of inches above? What if   it's half of the leg?' And we end up in what \nwe see and this is not the right thing to do."
