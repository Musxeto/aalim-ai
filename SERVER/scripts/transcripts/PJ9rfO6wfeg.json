  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ  admonishment for things that we not pay attention to assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The Prophet ﷺ sometimes reprimanded his companions over things that we may not pay attention to. The Prophet ﷺ was once in the masjid when a convoy came and they started speaking to the Prophet ﷺ and he found this smell that he prohibited the Muslims from entering the masjid when eating such plants, onions, garlics and the likes that have an offensive odor. So the Prophet ﷺ said, hadn't I prohibited you from eating from this tree and coming to the masjid? Be aware that the angels are offended from what the humans are offended of or offended from. So nowadays in Ramadan we go to Iftar and then go to Maghrib prayer or come and attend Isha prayer and Taraweeh and Subhanallah you are surrounded by people that offend you and the angels in the masjid and the other worshippers with the amount of garlic and onion that comes out with their breath. Now we don't say it's haram to eat. Nobody said that it is haram to eat it but it's haram to attend the masjid. And due to the fact that people want the reward of attending congregational prayer and Taraweeh, they overlook the prohibition and they still attend the masjid with this offensive odor that is repulsive, that is offending the angels and the worshippers and they are sinful for that."
