  "transcript": "My second question is, I borrowed my motorbike from my friend and she used it to go to the church, but I didn't say no because I'm afraid she will think I'm rude. So is it, am I sinful for that? You knew beforehand that she's going to the church? Zahra? Okay, I think you're right. I think we've lost Zahra. Anyhow, I'll try to answer both. If you lent your car, your motorbike, your any type of ride to a non-Muslim, knowing that he or she will use that to go to their places of worship, then you are sinful. Lending my car to a non-Muslim, period, without knowing where he's going to use it, is permissible. I don't know where they're going to use it, so the default is that inshaAllah they will use it for halal. But if they tell me, listen, it's Sunday, I need to go to church, it so happens I'm the pastor, I'm whatever, it's totally prohibited to assist them on such in our religion an evil act and a display of disbelief and kufr. And Allah Azzawajal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all. Bi-idhnillah."
