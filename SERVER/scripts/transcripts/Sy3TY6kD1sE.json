  "transcript": "is saying how should one calculate zakat if they have the nisab value and have a debt that they're owning the amount they have doesn't cover the amount of the debt we were told that one should subtract and any amount that they're owing and add any amount that is owed to them is this correct the answer is no if I have two hundred thousand euros debt I bought it from someone I spent it I bought something with it and he wants his two hundred thousand of me and I have a hundred thousand in my bank account and my zakat date is due tomorrow so today I have one of two options either either take the hundred thousand cash and give it to pay part of the loan so instead of having two hundred thousand I have only one hundred thousand left so there's no zakat on me if I wait til tomorrow then the cash money I have I have to give two point five percent two thousand five hundred euros for zakat regardless if I have two hundred thousand loan or two million loan this is a different issue as long as you have the threshold for a whole lunar year or a whole Hijri year you have to give the cat on that"
