  "transcript": "last question asum so this is inshallah the last question um you said in your talk about having a genuine excuse to be in a country uh where non-muslims are in majority and you walk through the otherwise it's better to be in a Muslim country a lot of people in Western countries who are connected to the Masjid they passionately feel that while there is more chance of FNA like described here but one thing that is better in these countries compared to a lot of the Muslim countries is that the freedom of speech while it's a double- Ed sword it helps as well a lot of pro protests that happen here we're genuinely able to influence our local ministers and pressurize them and get our uh opinion which impacts foreign policy which doesn't happen in non-muslim countries and so then if we move back to those countries while individually we'll save our families but that Global impact that the Western Muslims have had like in palistine and other conflicts um we're able to do that here so we're kind of taking a high risky road but there's High reward so do you have anything to say to that because people can get confused uh with the original comment seriously I have yeah I've been living like this for my entire life I care only about myself if I go to Jenna alone in all of you go to hell the hell with you seriously come on listen listen do I care yeah I would love to have you with me but I want to go to Jenna alone and whoever follows more than welcome I'm not going to risk me going to Jenna for the hope that I might take few of you with me but I'm risking it I'm not going to be a candle that gives people light while burning itself no save yourself save your families save your kids and everyone else Allah hasel to deal with them accordingly so I wouldn't stay here to demonstrate and to influence my MPS and my representative while finding my daughter or my son maybe going astray or my wife having uh a feminist ideas and wanting to have a divorce and sue my uh um whatever uh uh for every penny I have because I don't have a prenup so what am I doing save yourself and this is for someone who's capable of moving back and sustaining a healthy honorable standard of living don't save $50,000 and go to migrate deplete it in like six months and then come back begging no you have to go with a financial uh sustainable Financial income that would make you live honorably you and your family you don't want to go there for one two years and risk being kicked out coming back again to square one and rebuilding everything from scratch no you have to plan it right before you go and Allah Knows Best"
