  "transcript": "The next question is, can mahr be in forms of other than money, like property or education? The scholars say that mahr can be of anything that has a value. So, in the Hadith, the Prophet ï·º when a man wanted to marry a woman who displayed herself to the Prophet ïº. She offered herself to the Prophet and the Prophet had no interest in her. And she was standing there and the Prophet was looking elsewhere. He did not show any interest. So, a man stood up and said, ìO Prophet of Allah, if you donít have any interest in her, give her to me in marriage.î So, the Prophet asked him, ìWhat do you have? Any money?î The guy was stone broke. So, the Prophet said, ìEven if you get a ring of iron.î ìWhat is iron?î ìNothing, not silver, iron.î He said, ìThereís nothing. I have nothing.î So, the Prophet said, ìDo you memorize the Quran?î He said, ìYes, I memorize surah so and so and so.î So, he said, ìI give her to you so that you make her memorize these surahs of the Quran as a wage, as a mahr.î And they got married because of this. So, anything that has value can be a form of mahr. We always appreciate something that is tangible. Because it so happens that years later, maybe there is a difference of opinion or they canít live together and they have to divorce. The woman asks for khulu. The man says, ìOkay, give me back my mahr.î So, they come to the judge, ìWhat was your mahr?î She says, ìA trip to Hajj.î ìOkay, did you go?î ìNo.î Or she says, ìYes, I went.î So, how much, this is a problem. We donít have the value. So many times, they divorce and the woman says, ìHe did not give me my mahr.î The judge says, ìTrue?î He says, ìYes, itís true.î ìOkay, give her her mahr.î ìWhat is your mahr?î I said, ìA trip to Hajj.î ìFrom where?î ìFrom Los Angeles.î Long way. ìOkay, how much?î The guy says, ìThe approximate cost is $9,000.î The woman says, ìNo, itís $25,000.î ìWhy?î ìI was first class and staying in the Clock Tower or Darat Tawheed.î And sheís going for five-star package. And heís going for normal package. So, which one? They start to dispute. But when itís written, Hajj journey costs $7,000. There is a dispute. There is a divorce. He has to pay the $7,000. This is why we say it has to be tangible and fixed so that they would not become an issue of dispute in the future. And Allah knows best."
