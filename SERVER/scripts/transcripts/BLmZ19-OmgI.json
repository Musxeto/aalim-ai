  "transcript": "Suhail from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh I will mention you some scenarios can you please tell me is this backbiting or not and some people say that Salaf in many hadith Salaf backbited many people so I will begin with the scenarios. One scenario only because I don't have time. Okay I will tell you quickly so first scenario is can we hear the commentators criticizing the players, sports players for their profusion and people talk about openly action of the public figures. No we should not do this even if it is prevalent or commonly done in the media. Public figures are Muslims so if you criticize them this is backbiting and just because they're public figures it doesn't give you the right to criticize Sheikh so-and-so or the Da'ia so-and-so or the scholar so-and-so and think that okay because he's a public figure I can backbite him. Likewise players, sports sportsmen so they're playing cricket oh this guy doesn't know how to hit his wicket I don't know if you call it wicket or what oh he doesn't know how to run he lost he made this you're still backbiting him. You want to watch the game watch it but don't comment on it because you're commenting on it would be backbiting and you will be sinful for that and Allah knows best."
