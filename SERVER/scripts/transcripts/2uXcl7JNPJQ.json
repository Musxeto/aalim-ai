  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh which is \nthe greater which is the greater jihad,   Jihad Al Nafs or jihad in the Battle ground   as for the issue of differentiating between the \nJihad in the battlefield and the Jihad of your   own inner self and thoughts and whims and desires \nthere is no authentic Hadith favoring between them   you see Jihad is divided in the number of \ncategories there is Jihad of the disbelievers   there this is on on the battlefield   and this is ongoing to the day of judgment \nthere is the Jihad of the hypocrites   and this is done by rhetoric and writing exposing \ntheir plotting and plans there is the Jihad of   the sinners by preventing them from corrupting \nthe community and the society with their sins   with their openly sinning and inviting people to \nVice and evil Acts there is the Jihad of the devil   and there is that Jihad of our own whims and \ndesires all of these are considered to be   Jihad when it comes to the Jihad praised in the \nQuran it is definitely referring to the Jihad of   the disbelievers on the battlefield the dividing \nline between Islam and kufr but nevertheless   the other types of jihad are ongoing and \nthey are also good and Allah Knows Best"
