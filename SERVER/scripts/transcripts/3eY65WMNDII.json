  "transcript": "a sister says what does islam say if somebody intentionally avoids to get pregnant just because of fear of poverty because they are not rich and going through hard and tough times this is a sign of lack of iman when people have strong iman they believe that allah the almighty is the provider i came from my mom's womb deaf blind unable to speak unable to do anything to help myself allah made me grow up provided me with food provided me with provision until i came the man i am what makes me think that it's me who's taking care of my children and hence i have to stop bearing them until i'm financially stable this is a sign of lack of iman this is ignorance of who allah azza truly is nevertheless it is permissible to delay getting pregnant for a year at two or three if there is a legitimate reason someone who is pursuing their studies someone who ha were just blessed with a child and would need like three to four years to be able to get that child old enough to take care of itself and then become pregnant again rather than having them one after the other without any gap which would result in maybe not giving attention or the adequate attention to the infants in the early ages this is totally legit but it goes without saying that it is a sign of weakness of iman when we think everything with a pens with a pencil in paper one plus one equals two the salary is equal this much the rent electricity how am i going to feed the children no i'd rather keep three children and not have any more for another 20 years until i'm able to build a house or establish a career or something this is a sign of lack of iman if you believe that allah is that a zap is a provider then you should believe that no matter how many times your wife or wives get pregnant how many children you have this comes with them it's not you it's he is the one who provides for you and allah knows best you"
