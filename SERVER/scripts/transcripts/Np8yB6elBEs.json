  "transcript": "here the obligations and the pillars are full are good the only thing that was extra is following the Imam in the Salam so when you offered Salam you added something to your prayer you should have stood up but you've added something because you added something you should prostrate for or the prostration of forgetfulness after you conclude your prayer and offer your Salam you offer to sujud and then you offer another Salam so what you've done was the right thing"
