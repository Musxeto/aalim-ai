  "transcript": "drain from kosovo so my question is um when i joined the prayer late and i i have to make up the mister raka like the third or the fourth and after imam gives salam is it mandatory for me to say allahu akbar and rise up or i just rise up and make make up the eureka okay it is important to know that every movement for the imam for the follower and for the person praying alone that he has to say takbir of course except when rising from rukur so every time you move allahu akbar you go for sujud allahu therefore when the imam says the slim and you have to rise for the raqqa this is a movement and therefore you must it's mandatory for you to stand up saying allahu akbar and if you don't say that you have dropped one of the mandatory acts of prayer if you do that intentionally your prayer is invalid and if you do that out of forgetfulness you have to compensate that by prostrating two prostrations before the salaam when you want to conclude your prayer and allah azza knows best you"
