  "transcript": "from Saudi uh my question is about Surah M I heard that uh we should read Surah M before going to sleep does that u mean uh only at night or we could do it in the daytime as well no thank you you're quite welcome um the scholars say that reciting is part of the Bedtime AAR which is at night generally speaking so if one is taking a nap after prayer and before he's not included in that and if someone does not sleep the whole night and would continue till um f and praise faer and now he's going to go to bed so it's not night anymore should he recite it the answer is yes because this is considered to be part of his uh bedtime AAR and Allah Knows Best"
