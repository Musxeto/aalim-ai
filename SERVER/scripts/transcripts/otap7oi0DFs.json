  "title": "He pulled a prank on an elderly man by pulling the chair while he was praying - KUFR? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Farhan from India Sheikh I had a question today in the mosque what happened was my nephew he just pulled the chair and someone was praying and then it fell down so is this wrong or something? Is this what? Is this shirk or is this kufr? If he is mocking Islam and harming someone who is praying to make fun of Salat, yes this is kufr. Who in his right mind would do such a thing? No one does this out of joy and playfulness. Harming an elderly person who's praying on a chair and pulling the chair so that he would fall and make fun and laugh at a ritual of Islam and making fun of the Salat is kufr, if this is his intention."
