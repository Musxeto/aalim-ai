  "title": "Is it permissible to pay Jewelers in advance for Gold? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh amina says when we go to a jeweler and choose a design from him to make it would take a few weeks or days to make that particular jewelry so the jeweler takes some advance and we pay the rest of the amount after receiving the jewelry is this permissible as we are supposed to buy gold in one setting the answer is no this is not permissible at all and this is riba how is that i'll tell you after the sip listen to me the prophet said when he designated the six categories of materials these categories six categories must be hand in hand i can't give you two kilos of good uh dates in exchange for five kilos of medium quality dates haram it has to be exactly the same i can't give you a hundred grams of 24 carrot golds in exchange for 100 grams of 22-karat gold totally prohibited it has to be exactly the same hand-to-hand so when you want to buy something that the jeweler would design for you you cannot give him something in advance and then collect it later on and pay the balance what you can do is you must you have to segregate the two transactions the transaction of buying the gold then the transaction of molding it or designing it and manufacturing it the first one has to be done simultaneously give and take so i'd like this design how much would you charge me for it he says okay the gold itself is five thousand dollars my design and manufacturing would cost you one thousand dollars so first thing i do is i give him the five thousand dollars in exchange for the raw material the row row gold that he gives me so now i've got the gold it's mine this transaction is over there's no event now the second transaction which is him manufacturing according to the design i want i give it to him whether i give him a hundred dollars five hundred dollars a thousand dollars the full amount or i don't give him a penny which is logical he's got five thousand worth of of gold with him what would i give him in advance so i tell him do it as planned and as agreed upon a couple of weeks later i go and collect my gold and i give him his fee not the cost or the price of the gold that i bought two weeks ago because that was over so i hope this answers your question"
