  "transcript": "[Questioner] who says is itÂ \npermissible for men to apply inÂ Â  on their hands during their wedding orÂ \njust casually because some Muslims sayÂ Â  that it is Sunnah of our ProphetÂ \n(Peace and Blessings Upon him) HennaÂ Â  is a form of a plant that is used to giveÂ \na dying effect to the hair and sometimesÂ Â  to decorate women's hands with it I thinkÂ \nthey call it in the subcontinent as me HindiÂ Â  and henna is a natural substance thatÂ \nwas mentioned in the Sunnah and theÂ Â  Prophet (Peace and Blessings Upon him) himselfÂ \napplied it to his hair and to his beard and womenÂ Â  used to apply it to their hands and feetÂ \nand their bodies as a form form of adornmentÂ Â  so what's the ruling on men applying it on theirÂ \nhands and feet the scholars say that this isÂ Â  only known to be used by women and at the timeÂ \nof the Prophet (Peace and Blessings Upon him)Â Â  this was known to be used by homosexualsÂ \nor transgenders or gays not by real menÂ Â  as per Hadith in in Sahih Abi Dawood where theÂ \nProphet was brought by such a an individual andÂ Â  he ordered him to be boycotted and taken out ofÂ \nMedina uh to somewhere as a form of punishmentÂ Â  so it is known in our religion that whoeverÂ \nimitates women from the men is cursed theÂ  Prophet (Peace and Blessings Upon him) cursedÂ \nthose who imitate women from amongst the menÂ Â  and those who imitate men from amongst the womenÂ \nimitating the opposite gender is a major sin andÂ Â  whoever does this is cursed so men are onlyÂ \npermitted to use henna to dye their beardsÂ Â  to dye their hair and that is it not to AdornÂ \nany part of their bodies and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session withÂ \nme go to my website and you will find counselingÂ Â  sessions and apply for one if you can afford itÂ \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitledÂ Â  for one free session and this is for everybodyÂ \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannotÂ Â  afford it because they're poor I'll give themÂ \none free session without a problem a full halfÂ Â  an hour so come to me and let's speak aboutÂ \nit inshallah within the following two daysÂ Â  or three days I will uh try and seek Allah'sÂ \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
