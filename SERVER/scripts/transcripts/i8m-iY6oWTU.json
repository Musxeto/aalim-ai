  "transcript": "Brother Omar from Australia. Sheikh, I just wanted to ask, I was a bit curious and I really wanted to know this for a couple of days now. Will every single Muslim on Yawmul Qiyamah have to be punished first to pay for his sins or will Allah protect some people prior to no punishment? Will Allah save some people and not punish them at all or does everyone have to be punished first? Jazakallah Khair. Wa Jazak. As the Aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah, all those who are non-Muslims, who had the chance to hear about Islam, the Quran, the Prophet Muhammad ï·º, and rejected it and did not look into it and did not follow it, they will be punished in hell for eternity. As for the Muslims who died upon Islam, who were not apostates, who were not hypocrites, who did not commit anything that nullifies Islam, they were Muslims. There will be a scale where their good deeds and bad deeds are weighed. If their good deeds overweighs the bad deeds, it will erase the bad deeds and they will be admitted to Paradise. If their bad deeds overweighs their good deeds, the default is that they have to be purified in hellfire until they do their time, whether it's a year, it's a thousand, it's a million, and they have paid their dues, then Allah would admit them into Paradise after dipping them in the river of life so that they would be treated from their wounds and burns, and they will come to Jannah and live for eternity. This is the default. But there are those whom Allah's mercy may forgive. So yes, they are bound to enter hellfire. Allah says, no, I forgive them, put them in Paradise. This is Allah's mercy. This is a divine will. There are people who are sentenced for a thousand years. Allah says, take them out after one year or after one day or after one second, reducing their sentence. This is up to Allah Azza wa Jal, but this is the default and Allah knows best. You're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
