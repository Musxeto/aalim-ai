  "transcript": "from canada um my question actually it's a request can you please uh show us uh how to do uh proper like sunnah way of doing a zika on our fingers like i've heard different things so i'm not really sure about it can you please show us okay i will answer inshallah salheen from canada he says can you show us and illustrate to us the way of making vikr on your fingers according to the sunnah i don't know a specific way of making dikkar other than what was mentioned in the hadith that the prophet islam used to make zikr on the right hand only when making and some scholars say that it is a must to make dikkar only on the right hand and it's not permissible to use the left which is not true you can make subhan allah alhamdulillah allah on both hands but the sunnah is to use the right hand and to do this when doing dikka subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah subhana subhan allah if you want to keep count i made a set of five you can do this then you do it again this is a set of two sets of five three five four five sets of five this is 25. so now i can count the hundreds easily some people say that you have to do it on the three parts of each finger subhanallah subhanallah but i don't find anything supporting this in the sunnah which means that the sky is the limit what is your preference you find this three for each finger more convenient go ahead for it you find that doing it once on each finger like that go for it there is nothing prescribed to my knowledge and allah azzawajal knows best you"
