  "transcript": "Adrien from Serbia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Can we use alcohol or ethanol to clean impurities? Impurities are usually cleaned by water as this is the only substance and the best purer of all materials found in this world. However, scholars say, if the essence of the impurity is removed totally and it disappears from existence and none of its three characteristics remain no colour, no smell and no taste if it was totally removed by any substance even if a person did not intend it, that would purify it Inshallah"
