  "transcript": "Khurram from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh today? Alhamdulillah Okay Sheikh my question for today is if someone took halal debt from his uncle and uses it for two reasons number one for a business and number two in the way of Allah for example in voluntary and obligatory charity however in order to return the debt this person returned it through an amount which was earned in a haram manner for example given to you as a gift by someone you had unlawful relations with so does that make your initial charity invalid as well as although it was given by a halal debt but the debt was later cleared by haram means no it has no it has no impact on it because initially the charity was given from a halal debt"
