  "title": "They raise their hands in 2nd rakat of Fajr for Qunoot, what to do? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Alam from Indonesia. So my question is the majority of Muslims in my country follow the Shafi'i school of thought or the Shafi'i method and one particular thing people do here is to raise their hands and offer a Qunut prayer during the second Raka'ah or Fajr prayer after Ruku. So they would recite, Allahumma ahdini fi man hadayyi, tuwa'afuni fi man afaidh, and so on and so forth. So if I were to be a Ma'mum in a congregational Fajr prayer and the Imam raises his hands and offers Duha Qunut, should I join them and raise my hands as well or should I just stand silent and just listen to what the Imam says? JazakAllahu Khair, Sheikh. Wa Jazakum. First of all, raising the hands in the second Raka'ah of Fajr prayer every single day specifically as done in Indonesia, in Malaysia, in Shafi'i dominated countries, this is an innovation. What is the definition of innovation? It is something that the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam did not do but we do it in order to get closer to Allah azawajal. Now all the companions of the Prophet alayhi salam acknowledge that he did not raise his hands and do Qunut in Fajr. Where did they get this? They got it from misunderstanding of a Hadith because Qunut can refer to the Du'a, Allahumma ahdina fi man hadayt, and it can refer to not speaking in prayer and to stand still and also to prolong the recitation of the Qur'an. Therefore when they looked at some of such Hadiths, they thought that it was referring to the Du'a. Yet the Prophet did Du'a against R'il, Dhikwan, and from Bani Hudhail or Bani Lihyan, when they ambushed and assassinated 70 of his companions in Bi'r Ma'una, battle if I recall correctly. So for a whole month in the 5 daily prayers, not only in Fajr, he used to make Du'a against them, O Allah avenge my companions, O Allah destroy them until Allah azawajal revealed that you have nothing to do with this, laisa laka minal amri shay'un aw yatuba alayhim aw yu'adhibun. So he refrained and stopped. And it continued to the rest of his life. So to only isolate Fajr with Du'a al-Qunut was not done by the Prophet, to do it every single day was not done by the Prophet, and hence it's a bid'ah. Nevertheless, the Shafi'i school of thought is a respected and reputable school of thought. If the Imam is convinced that this is part of the Sunnah, and the congregation alongside with him, and they do this Du'a, what is it that we must do? The scholars say that there is no problem because it's a respected school of thought, that when the Imam makes Du'a, you raise your hands and say Ameen. And this is what I do when I travel to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, and I pray Fajr with the Muslims and they make the Du'a, I raise my hands and say Ameen, though I am convinced that this is not from the Sunnah and Allah Azzawajal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
