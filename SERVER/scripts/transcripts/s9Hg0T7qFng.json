  "transcript": "Nasir from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Alhamdulillah Sheikh, may Allah bless you for all you do and may Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala reward you and you as well. Sheikh I just had a question because it's kind of confusing me now it's regarding the 15th of Shaban I think it's called Shaban Shabi Barat and the 27th of Rajab Shabi um I just had a question like because what the situation is obviously I acknowledge that anything that is in the Quran and Sunnah you follow anything the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam did you follow but I've had people say oh you celebrate Shabi Barat and I argue that if the Quran and Sunnah doesn't mention it then you don't do it but they're telling me oh it's in a hadith it's authentic you do this you do that you celebrate it so Sheikh I just wanted your opinion on do you celebrate the 15th of Shaban or what do you do in this whole situation? All what these people say is baseless never ever the Prophet alayhi salatu wasalam was reported to celebrate this night nor the companions nor the tabi'een nor the tabi'it tabi'een all what they struggle and strive to provide you with is the honor of this night in some hadith which is disputed upon scholars whether authentic or non-authentic only the honor that this is an honorable night where Allah Azza wa Jal looks at the people of earth and forgives all those who are not disbelievers or having enmity with their brethrens these are the hadith and the likes of Allah forgives the sins even if it's as many as the sand uh particles of alij and and the likes nowhere in the shari'ah it says you have to pray you have to make this amount of dhikr you have to leave everything after maghrib and just pray until isha all of this is nonsense not proven from the religion but mawlana's who collect money from the congregation who want to keep the herd under their control they keep on insisting no you have to do this you have to obey us allah will forgive all of your sins we ask them it has it ever been proven that the 27th of rajab is the laylat al-isra'i wal-mi'raj the night of the miraculous night journey he said uh no to cut a long story short no it's not proven is laylat the middle of sha'ban and al-isra'i wal-mi'raj more important than the nights of eid whether it's eid al-fitr or eid al-adha the 10th of the hijjah which the scholars agree that it is the greatest day of the whole year because of the great forms of worship performed in it are these two days greater than these two eids i don't think so good these two days of eid has it ever been reported that the prophet used to pray all night long and celebrate it and do certain adhkar and the likes nope so where is your head i'm talking to your logic i'm talking to your knowledge of quran and sunnah why are you bringing all of these nonsense baloney to the religion oh because maulana said well tough bananas i can't help you in this akhi we follow quran and sunnah we direct people to do this oh shaykh it's hard pray fajr in the masjid oh shaykh it's hard fast mondays and thursdays fast three days of the white days do this do that give charity oh shaykh it's hard why would we prevent people from worshiping allah in the middle of sha'ban it's gonna you know cut my hand or my neck i'm gonna shed blood i'm gonna pay money from my pocket if there is any reward in it go for it but there isn't that's the only difference between us and them we limit people to follow the quran and the sunnah this is islam they innovate and come up with things that are not related and if you don't like it that's your problem you're not a good muslim you're this you're that and they start labeling you and allah azza wa jal knows best"
