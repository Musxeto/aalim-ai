  "title": "When to pray Fajr Sunnah, before the athaan of Fajr or after Iqamah? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "rania says to perform sunnah fajr is it before the athan of fajr or after or during the economy this is a questions that that a lot of the muslims ask and i'll give you a rule of thumb whenever the sunnah of a particular prayer is mentioned this means that it has to be at the time of that prayer so when we say fajr prayer this means that fajr prayer has a beginning of time where the adam is called and an end of time when the sun starts to rise and you cannot pray it correctly the time is out and you're sinful so when we say fajr sunnah this means that it has to be after the event because if i pray before that and this is part of midnight it's it has nothing to do with fajr likewise it has to be from till the end in between these two times and i hope this answers your question you"
