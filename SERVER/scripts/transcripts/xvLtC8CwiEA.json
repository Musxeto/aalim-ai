  "transcript": "i'm zed from india my question is i saw one of your video in where someone asks you that if someone misses assai prayer then what if someone what if someone misses answer prayer yes yes yes and you replied and you replied him and said that if someone misses assad and if it is maghrib time and there is no asylum time left left so one should go and join the imam of the maghrib prayer and he should pray through the car as imam pretty and he should get up and play extra wonder so i did the same way as you said and behind my uh the day i was doing two three rows and when i started to get up and you know people started to looking me that i did something strange thing and my friend's friends asked me that why i did that so i told him that i uh i make up my ass and they told me that my prayer is not valid and they were asking asking me the difference from it from where i got that okay i will answer inshallah from india he says whoever okay in the uh situation where he overslept could not pray asar woke up on the adhan of maghrib by the time he made wudu rush to the masjid the akama was already given mistake number one you should not have rushed to the masjid the moment you woke up you should have uh performed and prayed asar in your home because the akama was not cold if the was called while you are in the masjid or on your way to the masjid and you did not pray asar you have to pray the prayers in sequence the sequence is not pardoned or forgiven unless it's done by mistake so someone who's ignorant doesn't know he prayed maghrib afterwards he prayed for us why he said i didn't know i don't this is the best i know your prayer is valid or someone who had done this out of forgetfulness he woke up made went to the masjid prayed mahrib after finishing mother said dope slap i didn't pray asar now you can pray no need to repeat them but when you come and you know that you did not pray asar and they're praying maghrib you join them with the intention of asar so you pray first second third with the imam when he offers salam you stand up and you pray your fourth as asir after you finish your prayer you go and pray maghrib with the second congregation or on your own or whatever what is that the there is no covering this because this is ishti had from the scholars this case was not presented at the time of the prophet of some of the companions so that we can say that this is the delete and for them to say that your prayer is invalid requires a delete and they will not succeed in getting the delete as well and allah knows best you"
