  "transcript": "Abdullah says how do we place our hands on knees during grew cooler sujood in tisha hood etc must the fingers be held together or kept apart what about our feet I'm don't lie you want me to describe to you the whole process of the prophet's way of praying and this does not fit in this program this is a Q&A program your fingers should be normal not tight and not spread it should be normal so when you do the queer allahu akbar it's normal it's together not spread so and it's not really tight like this but it's it's normal palm of the hand you put the right on the left on your chest as per the hadith of volume in Hajj or so either you put the right on the left like this it does not go beyond your arm like some people do this this is not right you do this or you hold your wrist with left wrist with your right hand this is one of the ways of putting it on the chest when you bow when you go for ruk or you place your hands on the kneecap and you spread your fingers so you don't do this you do this as if you're holding your kneecap this is what was mentioned in the sunnah of the prophet's prayer rally his salatu was-salam when you fall down to rock or your fingers are pointing on the ground to the qibla and they are tight you don't prostrate like this rather you prostrate like that not like this and not like that your fingers are pointing to the Qibla your feet are erect well I can't do that here because it's my hand and your toes generally speaking are facing the Qibla as well but you know that the foot itself you cannot place all your toes on the ground because usually you have the big thumb and then the toes go down in sequence so when you have your foot erect on the ground usually it's only the the big toe and the one next to it that touches the ground and the other three are flying most likely depending on the way your foot was designed or created and when you sit down for tisha hood usually you put your left hand on your thigh and knee so it's the area in between if you hold your kneecap this is okay and if you put it a little bit between the knee and the thigh this is also applicable the right hand in the Dasha hood would be like this so you make a circle between the middle finger and your thumb while your index is pointing and the two fingers are in a fist like position and you place it on the area between your knee and thigh and you move your fingers wiggle your fingers in its place while doing tisha hood from the moment you sit until the moment you end your tisha hood either to stand for the third rocker or to offer the salutation the door and then conclude by giving Salam you keep on wiggling it in its position you don't go up and down you don't go in circles like some people do you don't just say la ilaha il-allah and that's it and and you go because the sunnah of the hadith of Ottoman hogr that the Prophet used to point at is on the index finger and move it making duaa with it so we're getting it shaking it in its place and Alonso gel knows best"
