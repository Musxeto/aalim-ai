  "title": "Ibn Hajr & Imam Nawawi were Asharis & said we can celebrate mawlid, so how can we accept them?",
  "transcript": "Miraj from Bangladesh Sheikh please explain to us this topic as we know from the Salah we can take knowledge from the people of innovation but we read books of like Ibn Nawawi and Ibn Hajar and there were Ash'aris and they were also saying that we can celebrate Mawlid but we read their books so my question is what was the meaning of the words of Salafis that we can take knowledge from the people of innovations first of all the people you've referred to like Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani Amir Al-Mumineen in the hadith he was not a full-fledged Ash'ari so many places in his book Fath Al-Bari and others he supported the Aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah in some incidents he may have been a bit confused and may support it or was inclined a little bit to the Ash'ari in the issues of Ta'weel but all in all he is from Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah likewise Al-Imam Al-Nawawi and all of these great Imams of Islam now no one in his sound mind would label them as to be people of innovation yes we admit that they may have made some mistakes in issues related to Aqeedah but this does not put them in the category of Ahlul Bid'ah or that they are full-fledged Ash'aris even those who are full-fledged Ash'aris that may have made few comments about the Ash'ari Aqeedah and supported it yet we after their death and demise go through their books and acknowledge that this chapter and this section where they spoke about Aqeedah is wrong but everything else was fine and kosher so we are people of fairness Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah we are people of fairness and we weigh the pros and cons we just don't come to a scholar and because of a mistake he made we just cross him out and say he is this he's that he's Ahlul Bid'ah he's an innovator don't go to his website don't go to his social media channels these are the people of Bid'ah because no one is infallible except the Prophet not even the companions may Allah be pleased with them so when you come and cross out great scholars of Islam who have contributed immensely to Islam and benefited the Muslims because of a mistake or two they made that is the way of the people of innovation and these are sectarian people who go and follow their Hizbiyyah because they want you to be glued on your seats listening to their Samaha and their own scholars which is totally pathetic and wrong so we have to be fair and we have to identify what to take and what not to take but not to definitely cross out the great scholars of Islam and Allah knows best you"
