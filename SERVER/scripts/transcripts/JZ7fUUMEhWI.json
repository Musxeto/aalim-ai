  "transcript": "you can speak in urdu but i do not know a word of it except pani and and husband said to his wife that i am giving you divorce he said i am giving you divorce two times i i unders [Music] and the polygon of the telephone and uh so i want to know that how many talks has been applicable on this where did this take place in india okay i will answer in shock but from india issues of divorce must be resolved with the courts in your country you you divorced in india and in india if you say three times to your wife i divorce you i divorce you i divorce you they make this final divorce though islamically it's only one but there is a difference of opinion among schools of thought and whenever there is an islamic sharia practice in a country we cannot cherry-pick and say no no no i'm not going to the court here i'm going to the court in saudi or i'm going to ask in egypt or i'm going to go to jordan because i know their fatwa suits me better this is not permissible why do we ask because if they were residing in saudi arabia and they asked a question we would have given them the fatwa according to what is implemented in the ifta here but when someone from pakistan from india calls all the way we cannot overrule their scholars and their islamic courts by giving them a fatwa especially when the in-laws her father-in-law is totally against it you made his day you divorced her twice and then you went to him and i said he said to him i divorced her twice so in his mind this is four times and he doesn't want to give her back to you you gave him a trophy by divorcing her three times so when there's a dispute it cannot be simply a fatwa that is given to you and then you start fighting with them and not giving them their daughter or claiming that the marriage is still valid when they are opposing that due to the law of the country and allah knows best"
