  "transcript": "Medina from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh This is why free mixing is not permissible, when you have a mahram, when you have a guardian, then your guardian is supposed to be there, if he cannot, then he allocates and authorize another mahram to replace him and be with you, but you cannot sit with a non-mahram who would be there with you, this is not permissible."
