  "transcript": "and the first question uh is from abroad she says is it possible to see Allah in our dreams this is an issue of dispute we have a Hadith that is authentic that the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam saw Allah in a dream however Allah is beyond our imagination and no one can see Allah before the day of judgment as he would reveal himself to us when we are in Paradise if Allah grant us this greatest favor and blessing of all while in dreams it's a possibility that Allah azzawajal May manifest himself as he wishes and pleases to an individual and it was reported that Imam Ahmed said that he saw Allah in a dream the issue is nowadays if I see a dream where someone says that he is Allah how would I verify this I can't and the vast majority of such claims would most likely and probably be Satan impersonating Allah and telling him telling the individual he comes in his dream that he's Allah so that he misguide him but is it a possibility it is a possibility are there any consequences not that I know of so if in your dream you see Allah and he tells you that I have Exempted you from praying Fajr on time you have to only pray for prayers this is Satan definitely or changing the law of sharia this is Satan or telling you when the day of judgment is this is Satan all of these things are not true and can't be true because they go against the religion of Allah and their religion is complete foreign so the religion is complete it cannot be completed more or you cannot add things or subscribe things from the religion now because that would go against the Ayah where Allah shows us his favor and Blessing by telling us that the Deen is complete at the time of the Prophet The Deen is complete there's no way that it can be altered or changed till the day of judgment so I hope this answers your question [Music] ha and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign foreign"
