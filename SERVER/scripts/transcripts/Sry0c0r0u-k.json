  "title": "Can a woman wax her legs & arms & can a man wax his chest? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "And I'm sure can a woman do waxing of her legs and hands if the hair is too much? Even if the hair is not too much, a woman may beautify herself as needed without any problem. And let me, instead of giving you a fish every day, let me teach you how to fish. The hair on the human body is of three types. One, prohibited to remove. For men, this includes the beard and the eyebrows. For women, this includes the eyebrows only. If she has a beard, she has to shave it or remove it. Two, hair that it is mandatory to remove. For men and women, and this includes the armpit hair and the pubic area hair. The third type of hair is the type that Islam did not comment on. So the general trend is, it's up to you. You want to remove it, you can do so. You don't want to remove it, it's up to you. So if I were to say that I'm a man and I have hair on my chest, can I remove it, wax it? Remove it, wax it. The answer is, okay. Don't I have to have any reason? No, I don't have to have any reason. I can remove it. Okay, I'm a man. Can I remove my arm hair and the hair on my legs? Yeah, you can do that. Seriously. Yeah, this is permissible to remove or to keep. Logically, people would look down at you and say, hey, are you coming out of the closet? Why are you removing? This is not natural for men, but it is not haram. It's a cultural thing. So going back to your question, a woman can, with or without any reason, wax her legs and her arms without any problem."
