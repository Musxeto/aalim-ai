  "transcript": "Rajab from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Is your name correct? Yes Sheikh Yes, yes what can I do for you Akhi? Sheikh my question is what is your advice to people who say that if you read Hadith and Quran from translation in your language directly you will be astray or you will become Gumrah You will become what? You will lead astray Ok, first of all Allah Azza Wa Jal said in the Quran Fattaqullah mastata'tum Fear Allah to the best of your ability So if this is the best of my ability I don't speak Arabic, I don't speak English, I don't speak German or French And the only book of Tafseer or the translation of the meanings of the Holy Quran or the Noble Quran And of the Sunnah are found in Tamil or in Urdu And you're telling me if I read it I'll go astray? So what should I do? Just look at the stars? And do nothing? No! This is totally bogus and whoever says this Wants you to remain in the state of ignorance till the day you die I always say this to my congregation I went once to I think maybe the Red Mosque Or I don't know what colour it was Somewhere in India And I went to pray Jumu'ah there And mashallah the masjid was packed And the imam came and he was like maybe 150 years old Something, woah So, and I'm getting there I'm not making fun of old people, I'm already half that age So he went in, he delivered the khutbah Now I'm an Arab I did not understand a word of what he said except الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله He was reading from a book And you can see flies coming out of it It was an ancient book and probably he read it like a gazillion times And I was looking around and everybody else could not understand a word And the guy gave two khutbahs And he started the prayer Now I didn't understand the khutbah Those natives did not understand the khutbah So the most likely, the imam was the only one who understood it And I'm really doubtful if he did understand what he read What is the use of Friday khutbah If it's wasted like this Once a week And no one understands anything And no one gets the messages of this beautiful religion This is why I say when you are in a country that don't speak Arabic Don't give your khutbah in Arabic Just say the shahadatain أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله و أشهد أن محمد رسول الله And recite an ayah يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ And then go ahead and speak in the native language of the country Or in English where everybody understands and benefits And learn their religion Rather than just reading something that nobody understands What you're reading My question today is a follow up of yesterday's 10,000 riyal investment question Now the conditions are that I give 10,000 riyals to the person to buy some products and sell in his shop So we have a deal that he sells the product and does the legwork And the profit is divided, suppose 30-70 If the product was not sold and it expired then that's a loss So if the product is sold for 20,000 That means 10,000 is the profit of which I get 30% And 10,000 original amount is recovered Which will again be used to buy more products and this goes on Now the doubt is that when I want to stop after some time So this time the 10,000 was used for buying products and sold for 20,000 So the 10,000 profit is divided 30-70 And the original amount of 10,000 was also recovered And that money comes back to me So I just wanted to confirm, is this okay now? Yeah, this is 100% fine This is totally legitimate and legal and Islamic There's nothing wrong in that وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"
