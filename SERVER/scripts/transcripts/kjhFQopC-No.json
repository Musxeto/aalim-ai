  "transcript": "uh for us from uh tunisia he says now we i've come across some of the scholars saying that praying in stolen clothes is haram and the prayer is invalid this is some of the schools of thought's opinion that the aura is covered by something that is not halal so it is as if you're not covered and the prayer is invalid and this is not true the most authentic opinion is that the prayer is valid but a person is sinful for what he stole so wearing wet clothes that may make you sick or clothes that may harm you would that invalidate the prayer again this has not no impact on the validity of the prayer it's a separate sin"
