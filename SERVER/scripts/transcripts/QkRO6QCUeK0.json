  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I have this confusion that like the time for Isha in the masjids now are so much earlier than what the Muslims are doing. It's like literally like it's almost an hour difference because it's in the summertime basically the time for Isha is very weird. Okay, the issue of Isha prayer is a confusing issue especially in the Scandinavian countries and up north like in Scotland and the likes. And the reason is we know that Isha time begins when the redness in the twilight disappears. So when the sun sets, after it sets, there's a redness glow in the west which indicates that it is still time for Maghreb. Once the redness glow goes, there's no redness, then this is the time for Isha. I haven't been to that country or these countries to verify it and see it myself. And it seems that you have to ask the people of knowledge if there are any, and there has to be. But real people of knowledge, real scholars of Islam, highly decorated students of knowledge, not a Qari from Egypt or Syria who knows few verses of the Qur'an and becomes a Sheikh. No, he doesn't qualify. Someone who has studied Fiqh and with the Shuyukh and has an understanding and knowledge. And you have to refer to them. Personally, if the redness continues till almost Fajr time, this can't be the case because when are we going to pray Isha? It doesn't make any sense. So usually I say to people, I think and presume that Isha would begin an hour after sunset. But if this continues, the redness continues, you have to refer to your scholars. The easiest way out is to combine Isha at the time of Maghreb. So after the sun sets, you pray Maghreb three rak'ahs, then you pray Isha four rak'ahs and you go to bed because it's already 11 o'clock and Fajr is in three or four hours time. It's not enough time for you to sleep. So combining Isha to Maghreb when you go to bed immediately afterwards is permissible in summertime in such areas where the night time is too short and Allah knows best. you"
