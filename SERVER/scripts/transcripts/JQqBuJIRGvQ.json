  "transcript": "Sarah. She says that her uncle divorced his second\nwife and now they have no communication, none whatsoever, with her children, who are their\ncousins. So how can they contact and honor ties of\nkinship? The answer: If you don't know where they are\nand you cannot get hold of them and there is no means of communication, they are as\ngood as lost. You can't communicate with them. How can you do that? If you try to google them, if you try to get\ntheir address from your uncle and you fail, then there is no sin, none whatsoever, upon\nyou for not contacting them because this is not in your ability. And Allaah عز و جل does not burden a\nsoul beyond what it can bear. Something I cannot do, I cannot fly in air,\nI cannot walk on water. How can I contact my kinship if I don't know\nwhich country they're in? I don't know their names. I don't know their addresses or phone numbers,\nthen there is no sin on me and Allaah عز و جل knows best."
