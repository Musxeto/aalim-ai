  "transcript": "Omar from Egypt Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Are any sound effects that are made from a digital audio software like the sound effect you hear if you got a question right or a question incorrect These sounds are made from instruments in a computer software Is it still halal to use and intentionally hear these sounds because they don't give us the same effect as music? Ya Omar, Ya Omar, Ya Omar The problem is musical instruments This is what the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam prohibited So if I have a guitar and I pull one string and the string says ding Is this music? No, this is one tone But if I make a chord and I start to play, this is music Likewise, digital invented or created sounds When you have a multiple choice question and you choose the wrong answer And you digitally make a sound This is not music, there is no problem in that Or if you have a correct answer, it goes ding There is no problem in that, there is no music There is no beat to it, there is no feeling of sensation listening to such things A fire siren, there is no problem in that An ambulance, there is no problem in that And I hope this answers your question"
