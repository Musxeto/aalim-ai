  "transcript": "Musa from Azerbaijan. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam. Sheikh if there is a negligible amount of urine like the size of the top of a needle on the prayer mat but there are several of them in different parts of mat but each of them is negligible in amount but if you put them together it may be at the size of half of a drop or more some of them just happened in different times can I pray on this mat of course not even if it's negligible Musa how is this logical that all our questions all our lives revolve around a tiny negligible drop of urine that is making my life miserable I don't know if I dropped it here or there what are you leaking all the way oh and on prayer mats and on different prayer mats either this is a made-up question that hypothetically go is going around your head or if it's it's a correct scenario it's taking place if it's real you have a problem in your life if it's hypothetical this is not the time to ask hypothetical questions because shaitan is messing up with your head analyze your daily routine and you'll find that 95 percent of it revolves around intrusive thoughts exaggeration and overthinking what if this take take uh place what if I dropped something six years ago and I forgot it what if what if this is how shaitan messes up with your life and the biggest problem is not that the biggest problem with all OCDers that come to me is that they do not find the sweetness of salat they don't concentrate in prayer they don't love ibadah all their forms of worship is like a mountain suffocating them it's on their chest they can't breathe because shaitan is making it hard for them you have to get out of this vicious loop this vicious circle or it will destroy your life forever"
