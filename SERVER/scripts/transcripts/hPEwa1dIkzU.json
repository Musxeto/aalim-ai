  "transcript": "when parents are against salafi like they doesn't allow me to keep my beard long and uh they they want me to say mawlid something something like that so can you say what is the ruling for that how can i behave to my parents okay i will answer the final question is from farzine and he says that if i have a methodology of following the seraph and i love to follow the quran and the sunnah while my parents are against that so they always come and fight with me when it comes to growing the beard or not celebrating the innovations they're falling into what should i do this is your test from allah and your test is to bear and to tolerate such ignorant parents you have no other alternative but to be kind dutiful diplomatic respectful with them because they're your gateway to jannah and at the same time you have to remain steadfast with your feet on the ground no compromise when it comes to religion of islam and following the sunnah so what to do just smile in the faces don't argue don't lecture them you are still a child in their eyes so when you say to them so and so says it's bad so they will immediately say you're a wahabi you're an extremist you are an infidel you don't have a math hab so we're not going to take you for uh granted or accept what you say this is not the right way don't lecture them don't debate with them don't argue with them be as much as you can a dutiful child whenever they say something you do it before they ask you to do it you get the groceries you help cleaning the house you teach your younger siblings you do the shores of the house with a big smile this will show them that ah this guy changed because of his religion and they will accept this insha allah from you you"
