  "transcript": "Tazawer from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Hope you're doing good. May Allah increase you in more knowledge and increase everyone in this call and every Muslim with more knowledge. My friend had a question. He said if one lays down and says the bedtime adhkar and then breaks his wudu while awake, after that he gets to do something and does not sleep between this. Does he have to renew his wudu and repeat the adhkar? Jazak Allahu Khair Sheikh. As long as he is on his bed, no he does not have to renew his wudu nor repeat his adhkar because he did what he has to do. But if he leaves the bed and goes and answer emails or have a meal and something like that and then goes back to the bed, he has to be in the state of wudu and say his adhkar once again."
