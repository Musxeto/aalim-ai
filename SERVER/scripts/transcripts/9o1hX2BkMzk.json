  "title": "Permissibility of being buried with sentimental items (Abdullah ibn Unais being buried with stick)",
  "transcript": "i was listening to mercy to the world last night and you mentioned something about i believe that when they used to know that we pleased with him and how the puppet had given him a stick and the property used to have a sphere could i answer if i'm not mistaken and so my question is some is it permissible for us to do it in our time can you repeat i didn't hear the beginning of your question and and so i'm asking is it admissible for you to keep a sick in your will or to write it in your will uh zainab dean from the uk he says about a stick that was given to abdullah and him asking to have it with him in his grave when they bury him now the stick was given to him by the prophet also i'm not sure of the authenticity of this hadith but there is no reason for me not to believe it what's the ruling on putting in your will that xyz to be with me in my grave if it has no value meaning if i say i'd like you to put a million quid a million pounds uh in my grave and bury it with me this is totally prohibited not permissible but if it's something like a diary if it's something like a ring that has no value but it has sentimental values for you and you ask them to bury it with you this seems permissible there's nothing wrong in that abdullah nice ask for this stick for a purpose may allah be pleased with and that is because it was given to him from the prophet hassam and we know that anything that relics or whatever that belong to the prophet sallam we can seek blessings of allah seek barakah from it like his cloak like his clothes like his sweat etc so this is why he asked for that now we don't want to open the door for people to say oh sheikh when i die i'd like to have my kitten with me so many people especially in the uk are so obsessed with the cats and they have funerals and when the cat dies i get tons of mail saying sheikh will my cat be with me in jannah i don't know will it have horain as well what is this so there is this possession or actually of a session where people have towards their cats so i don't want to open the door generally speaking if it's something that's not where it's worthless it has no value and and people the heirs would not call for it can be buried with you"
