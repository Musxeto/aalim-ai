  "transcript": "uh you mentioned uh the term uh psychologist psychiatrist um a couple times what is it when you see this where is the the line where you mentioned seeing a muslim psychologist so what's the line there within the deen within islam with psychology and islam obviously psychologists study study of human behavior and whatnot but have you seen sometimes when there's a conflict there you know when you have secular psychology and then you have the teachings of dean do you see how is the fine what's the what's the in your experience the fine line there where you have you seen some contradictions there because some we've seen some growing thing here uh that people now are seeing that some people as this is almost sometimes they'll take the advice from the psychologist over the the dean well uh unfortunately this is happening in so many places now psychology is a science there's no doubt in that but who had ever said that every science is infallible nobody now if you analyze what the science upon you'll face that theory it is that are totally irrelevant and wrong so a muslim psychiatrist when he analyzes a problem he knows when this is closer to being schizophrenia when a person is bipolar or not and such a person being bipolar would swing with both swings is this something that justifies him doing things and then we can say oh the poor thing he's bipolar he's exempted is did he reach the level of insanity where when he does something he's not accountable like the thing that happens in the west so many times so a murderer may uh skip punishment because of his psychiatric evaluation and this is not the case in islam a muslim psychiatrist is a person who balances this science with our islamic beliefs because unlike other religions islam is the only religion that came up with a law with the sharia that is valid till the end of time so we have a law from the quran that governs our relationship man to man our relationship man to allah the creator and the rest of the world so if someone kills someone we have to know because insanity is a level where we can abstain from inflicting the prescribed punishment for uh uh the predetermined murder and manslaughter so this is why a muslim psychiatrist is needed we have to know when to give medication lots of the modern psychiatrists would just put you on prozac oh you have depression go ahead take uh um medical uh marijuana everybody's uh going for that nowadays especially in your country the state so i get lots of questions sheriff i'd like to do part you know and it's medical reason not to get high what is this yes this is permissible in very very very very limited cases but now with psychiatrists with doctors who don't know islam would prescribe it for everybody so yes a muslim psychiatrist is the right one to strike the balance and to know what is uh applicable what is not sometimes spiritual healing is in in need instead of getting medication all what you need is to learn who allah is is to learn why he created you and to trust him a lot of our problems are solved if we manage to trust allah"
