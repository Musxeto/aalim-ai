  "transcript": "Shamil from Sri Lanka Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I'm planning to start a modest men t-shirt brand and I'm planning to print Quranic verses on it but since it is inappropriate to wear in places like washroom can I rephrase the meaning without using the exact script like for example the Quranic verses indeed with hardship comes with ease can I use it as ease is follows hardship so something like that is it in Arabic that I will take from that from is it in Arabic or in English it's in English it's in English no problem okay because whatever you write in English is not the Quran this is the translation of the meaning so the translation of the meaning does not have the secrecy of the Quran itself"
