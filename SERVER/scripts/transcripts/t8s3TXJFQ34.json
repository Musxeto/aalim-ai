  "transcript": "Faheem from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh if we miss at least one rakah in congregational prayer then in the last rakah while sitting should we only recite At-Tayyihat and remain silent until the imam offers salam? When a person skips one or more rakah in congregational prayer he's obliged after the imam offers salam to stand up and complete the missing of his own salat this is agreed upon the issue is now when i'm sitting in the last sitting of the prayer in congregation which is the fourth rakah of the imam but it happens to be the third for me i have two options either to say At-Tayyihat until and remain silent for a minute or two until the imam offers the salam or i can continue and say and i make dua until he offers the salam and i stand up without any doubt no one says do the former and say your Tashahud and just sit there watching the chandeliers and looking at people's watches next to you and observing the masjid doesn't make sense you are in salat there's nothing that you should stay idle without saying or doing anything you have to remember Allah make dhikr make dua so the answer to your question is do the latter which is say the whole thing until he offers the salam then you interrupt it and stand up and finish your prayer"
