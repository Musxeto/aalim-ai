  "title": "The Earnings of a Person and his Manual Labor Chapter 10 Part II in Kuwait assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "and welcome to the second part of tonight's uh [Music] and the tenth chapter and we should at least i think be putting the pedal to the metal as they say and try to [Music] talk a little bit faster because our time is limited tomorrow is our last day but nowhere inshallah hopefully we're on track we still have 47 uh the earnings of a person and his manual labor hadith number 993 narrated the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said nobody has ever eaten a better meal than that which one has earned by working with one's own hands the prophet of allah used to eat from the earnings of his mineral labor so this hadith a lot of the scholars considered it to be indicating to the virtue of working with your own hands as a craft so whether you what was the craft of prophet dawood iron man is a movie [Music] he was a black blacksmith is the more appropriate uh word for that so he was a blacksmith a prophet was a carpenter and prophet musa a shepherd our prophet also worked in as a shepherd and as a businessman with trading so some scholars made this hadith only to highlight the virtues of working with your own hand as a craft however the hadith is more general so even trading is earning from your own hand teaching an engineer a doctor all of these not necessarily you have to have labor and someone says i can be a dentist no no no no it's best you do something like a goldsmith or sweeping the floors in order to have it pure no any work that you work and actually put effort into it including trade including farming that would be similar to the hadith now what other sources that one can earn other than such jobs service is also working with your own hands investing investing is working with your own hand fashionista is working with your own body what limiting your thoughts to what you do there are incomes that you don't do such as gifts so i can sit home and people give me gifts i can earn through inheritance my father died and he left me a fortune so i'm eating from it is this halal but the best way of earning is something that you do why because it prevents you from begging people and asking people and scholars differ whether farming is better or trade and i am inclined to farm him why because it has a lot of reliance on allah a merchant buys the goods he may sell it with a profit he may break even he may sell it with little loss a farmer make it or break it he does his work and waits for five months six months yeah maybe floods can come maybe drought maybe not uh pesticide uh pesticides are not used and a lot of uh disease is coming you never know so there is a lot of reliance on allah azzawajal farming a lot but it's a difference of opinion so in this same chapter you know this hadith this book is uh in the same chapter there are a number of hadiths one of them the prophet said as um for you to go and chop for firewood and come and sell it better than you ask people whether they give you or not so this is one of the forms of income to ask people to beg so no no work do whatever it needs but don't beg people the second hadith when abu bakr may allah became the khalifa he went to the market to trade romer and abeda stopped him said where are you going he said i'm going to put food on the table what i'm going to do is no you're a halifa you can't go to the souk this is five dinars no this is six week bargaining you make a business deal so he says that my people abu bakr says my people know that my craft would not be short from feeding my family my craft being a mention and a businessman have i not been engaged in ruling the muslims and running their affairs then in this case i have to refrain from trade and me and my family would eat from the treasury of the muslims gave him half a sheep per day this is his wages the value of half a sheep per day this is a muslim ruler and he accepted that and he lived upon that you"
