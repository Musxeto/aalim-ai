  "title": "Is it ok NOT to wear an Abaya, can a woman just wear baggy clothes",
  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, my question is, is it permissible for women to wear loose pants instead of the abaya or is it only permissible to wear the abaya? Jazakallahu Khair Sheikh Wa Jazakum First of all, a woman has to conceal herself fully before going out. So anything that may show the curves of her body or the bone structure is totally prohibited for her to wear. If she's wearing pants or the likes or even a skirt, that is not permissible. She has to have an outer garment like an abaya to go out with. This is different from if she's praying home. But we're talking about the awrah of seeing. So this is totally prohibited for her to leave the house wearing such trousers and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
