  "transcript": "consider subscribing brother haroon from bosnia so my sheikh mike the question is um i go to a public mixed high school and some guys like to play basketball during gym class however of course some of them wear shorts above the knees so i was wondering uh can i play basketball with them as well without looking at their aura so the question is can i join other players who expose their thighs as the thighs as known to us to be part of which a man cannot look at another man's aura so this is an issue of dispute the overwhelming evidences support the fact that what's between the naval and the knees is aura and as the prophet said do not look at the aura of a living person or a dead person and in another narration the prophet himself said alaihis allah and these are some of the evidences to prove that this area of a man between the navel and the knees is part of the restricted area to look at so it's not permissible there are other evidences that the prophet may have done this allah once and some of those who do not have knowledge held on to it and claiming that this is what should be done and the thighs of a man for another man to look at is okay with something related to culture and this is totally wrong and we carry the hadith where the prophet al-islam was sitting once on a well and abu bakr omar were sitting next to him and he revealed some of his thigh because he was on in that well dangling his feet inside that this is an incident so either it is something specific for the prophet allah salatu because when the prophet's actions sallallahu conflict with what he had taught us the scholars say that what counts is the teachings his actions may be considered as one something specific for him so he told us only to marry maximum of four women at a specific time while he married more than that so we know that this is only specifically for him or that he did this out of a necessity that we may know not know of or that he did this before the ruling came and the abrogation of the permissibility of exposing a man's thigh was abrogated and the final ruling is what he taught us therefore it is best for you brother harun not to play with such other students now if you tell me that you're compelled in your pe physical education class that you play in your basketball team and you have to be with them in order to pass your exams in this case this is an issue of necessity and there's no problem you should not look at their thighs but going back to what we know of basketball most of the shorts of the basketball players are quite long and they reach the knees some of them cover the knees some of them are just above the knees the knees are not part of the aura therefore if a man's knees are exposed this is permissible what's above the knees and that is the thighs is what you should be concerned of and allah knows best you"
