  "transcript": "abdulrahman from the uk he says we know that allah's names are 99. well first point they're not limited in 99 they're much more than that but the hadith said that allah has 99 names 100-1 whoever learns them will enter jannah scholars say that they are not limited in 99 into 99 names there are much more secondly abdul rahman says and we know that there are names that are not found in the quran the sunnah 0.2 this is not true abdulrahman we cannot give names to allah unless they are in the quran and in the sunnah if a scholar if a companion says that xyz is one of allah's names if it's not found in the quran or the sunnah or the consensus of all scholars of islam no one differed then we do not accept it and among them is a rashid this is point three most likely abdulrahman is referring to the hadith in surah tirmidhi which lists the 99 names and this hadith is not authentic most scholars of islam acknowledges this hadith is weak so you do not take from it the actual names of allah azzawajal as per the quran the sunnah where to get these beautiful names from the quran the sunnah allah has blessed me with his grace that past ramadan on this blessed channel zad channel i attempted to list these names in english and their meaning and you can find this inshallah on zad youtube archive or if you go to my youtube channel you will find the playlist with i think 102 names that allah has blessed me to compile and allah knows best"
