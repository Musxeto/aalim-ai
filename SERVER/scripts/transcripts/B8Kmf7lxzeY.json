  "transcript": "from bangladesh my question is uh when praying witure with the imam after taraweeh is it permissible to stand up right after right when the imam uh completes the slim without me giving my salams just so that it it doesn't stay odd and it stays even so that i can pray with you later on i will answer inshallah perhaps can we if we're praying witter behind the imam and in taraweeh and when the imam prays the last raka and he offers salam i want to pray to hajjud at home so can i stand up and pray another raka so that the total of prayers is 12 for me while the imam prayed 11. so that then i can go back home and pray as many as i want and then offer raqqa witcher the answer this is permissible but is it recommendable the answer is no shaytaan would penetrate your heart after a couple of days when you stand up where everybody has concluded their with your prayer and they're looking at you and while you're praying you say yes yeah they all know that i'm going to pray to hatred yeah i feel good and you take real ease and comfort in your prayer this is a door for shaytan pray with you with them offer salam with them nobody knows what you're going to do when you go home pray as many rakhas of the hajjud as you wish two by two without performing with your because the sufficient the first one was sufficient uh for you"
