  "transcript": "We have Umm Amina from the UAE. So I have two questions. The first one is, my father passed away like ten years ago. And he has almost 40 children. So when he passed away, they said that it would be very difficult to define the properties. So they kept it. And I told them that that is not Islamically correct. And they said, well, you know, we are not following the Islamic way of defining the inheritance. So I told them, because I didn't want to get into too much trouble with people, so I wrote a letter that I am not interested in the inheritance anymore. Then I listened to one of your lectures that you cannot do that. So did I do the right thing? And if it's not the right thing, what do I need to do now? And that was almost ten years ago that I said I don't want to have anything to do with it. They shouldn't give me anything. OK, as for your first question, Umm Amina, whatever Allah has given you as part of the inheritance from your father, this is your God-given right. You can possess it. It's up to you whether to keep it and utilize it or to give it away as charity or to let go of it by distributing it on whomever you wish from your siblings and from the other heirs. The paper that you had written stating to them that you have no interest in it at the moment is not binding because the inheritance is not divided. So you did not possess it yet. You cannot give something you did not possess. Therefore, you have the right to claim it whenever they are distributing any of your father's wealth. Whenever they do so, you can claim it because it's your God-given and you can possess it and then give it in means of charity. But if you take them to court, your siblings have no right in preventing and stopping the distribution of such wealth. This is your God-given right and this is the right of all other heirs. Allah gave them this money. Who are you to prevent them? So if they say that we're not going to divide it Islamically and they don't give heed or pay heed to doing the right thing, you should not respect them as well. And you should take them to court and demand your right. If they want a peaceful settlement, they will come and say, okay, our father's property is equivalent to so-and-so, your share is so-and-so, we'll buy your share, here you go. And then you can do that and document it and it is permissible and halal and Allah knows best. That's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
