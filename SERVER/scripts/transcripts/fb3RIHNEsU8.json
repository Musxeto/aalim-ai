  "transcript": "Yassin from Germany. Okay, Yassin. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh my question is if somebody makes an oath to Allah that he will pray two rakahs every time he does a sin but now the rakahs are too much because he did the sin too much, does he have to expiate every time he does that sin or is one expiation enough? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. No, it is only one expiation for the oath that he took upon himself or the vow that he put upon himself to break that vow or oath forever and he has to repent and ask Allah for forgiveness because he initially has to abandon this sin without prayers or sadaqah or any compensation from his side. Doing so or failing actually to do so is sinful by itself. To add insult to injury and to break an oath over that, that is also sinful but yes he only does this once and he's not bound to his oath anymore and Allah knows best. you"
