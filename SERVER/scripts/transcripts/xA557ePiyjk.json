  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India Sheikh in kaafir contries the laws and regulations \nare opposite to the Islamic rulings for example in   marriage the law of a kaafir country does not \nrequire the wali of the Bride for the marriage   to take place so my question is if a if a kafir \nhusband decides to write a will or overseer for   his revert wife what is the Islamic way of writing \nis it written on a piece of white paper and signed   in front of witnesses are both of them kaffir \nno the wife is a revert and the husband husband   is kaafir the wife is a revert so they can't \nbe in marriage together they have to separate   if they separate and the kaafir husband wants \nto allocate some of his property to his ex-wife   which is not his wife anymore this is \nconsidered as a gift he can only allocate   less than one-third of his wealth entire wealth \nhe can write it on a piece of paper he can go and   write it with a lawyer whatever sells whatever can \nbe applied because his family would immediately   jump the gun after his death and claim that \nthis is not valid so he has to uh authenticate   it with a lawyer in a legal fashion so that \nit would not be contested in Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
