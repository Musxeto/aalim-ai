  "transcript": "Nazar from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh what's the ruling on advising someone not to start praying emphatic Sunnah of Fajr while Iqama has been given however getting confronted by ruling of his as per the report of Ibn Masud of praying Sunnah of Fajr in corner while congregation is held for obligatory one is this Sunnah exempted from prohibition in such cases no this is not true and it's not authentic and we have to look into this narration of Ibn Masud may Allah be pleased with him if the narration of Ibn Masud found in Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaiba or Musannaf Abdul Razzaq for example was authentic then we are confronted by a dilemma the hadith of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam where he says there is no prayer valid while the prayer of the congregation is on the Prophet is telling us that the old prayers are invalid when the prayer of the congregation is on and then we have this narration of Ibn Masud coming and praying on his own while the congregation is on so who should we believe and follow Ibn Masud or the Prophet Alayhi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam this is a no-brainer blind followers of their Madhab like some schools of thought is no we will follow Ibn Masud the hell with that with all due respect you want to follow that follow that personally I want salvation and salvation is done through following the Prophet Alayhi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam do you mean that Ibn Masud did not know do you mean that Ibn Masud was committing something wrong do I don't mean anything I mean that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is infallible he doesn't make mistakes Ibn Masud is like all other companions may Allah be pleased with them as great as Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali and to the small companions they're all great but they are fallible they do mistakes they are humans and the history and the books of hadith are filled with their mistakes which were done out of Ijtihad not out of arrogance or out of wanting to sin this is why in the Quran if you're a Muslim Allah says if you were to disagree or dispute over a topic then refer it back to Allah and the Messenger Alayhi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam Quran and Sunnah now we are disputing whether to pray voluntary emphatic Sunnah of Fajr while the congregation is on so you tell me when we refer it back to the Quran and the Sunnah what is the answer the Prophet said Alayhi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam that there is no prayer valid while the congregation is on so who should we follow you do the math"
