  "transcript": "and finally ahmed says can we go into business partnership with someone who borrowed money from a bank as long as you did not borrow this money ahmed there's no problem in going into partnership with someone whose source of income is haram because the sin is on him the money he has at hand at the moment which you want to collaborate with and invest to you it is like any money you get from a bank you get from a shop you get from inheritance or it doesn't matter of where it came from he's sinful for borrowing it from the bank but as the business is halal and he's your partner i'm not required to ask every partner that comes to me where did you get this money from and allah azza knows best"
