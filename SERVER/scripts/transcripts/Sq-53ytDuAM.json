  "transcript": "is an etiquette for that the second part of the Shahada whoa ash hadu Ana Muhammadan Rasul Allah what is the definition of Rasul and what is the difference between Rasul and Nabi Nabi is a prophet Rasool is a messenger what is the difference there are a lot of definitions and statements the most authentic is that a messenger is someone sent to people with the specific revelation and law for them while a prophet is someone who is sent to his people but without a new revelation or a law he follows the revelation and the law of those before him but he does not have a specific law of his own such as prophet Sulayman before him was his father the wood and they are from the very Israel see they all followed what the books of musa peace be upon him and so on so to testify that the prophet alayhi salaatu Ozlem is a messenger of allah or the messenger of allah why not the prophet of allah because every messenger is a prophet by default every messenger is but not the other way around not every prophet is a messenger and this is why the Prophet is also some he first became a prophet or a messenger what was first he was a prophet when Allah told him a pora bismi rabbika alladhi halep this is a prophecy he was given revelation but he was not ordered to convey he was not ordered to order the people to come once he was ordered to do that and the scholars say the order or the message came to him through which surah yes I sent them very good Adam of death fear and with death there Oh Hollis this is an instruction pump and they go and warn your people so what does believing in the Prophet Allison to be a Messenger of Allah include it includes that you obey Him and whatever he orders you and that you refrain from whatever he denies you and prohibits upon you and that you believe him in everything that he tells you about and that you do not worship Allah except through his commands for things if there was a quiz I would include this definitely what does the belief in the message of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam include four things obey him in what he ordered refrain from what he had prohibited believe him in whatever he had told us about because he tells us about Jenna now there is no order and there is no prohibition so this is belief and number four to worship Allah only through his command you do not worship Allah with something innovated something from your own whims and desires only through the way of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam therefore to believe in the message of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is to believe that any religion other than his nowadays is not accepted so someone says I believe in Muhammad to be a great messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam I believe in the Quran to be a revelation but I am still a Christian but I don't believe in Jesus to be the Son of God he is a messenger and a great messenger and I love him and I remain on my religion yet I believe in your religion as well this is a kafir he will not be accepted or admitted to Jenna the Prophet said salatu salam by the one who's my soul is in his hands no Jew and no Christian would hear about me and does not believe in me except Allah would admit him to Hellfire there is no compromise first of all but we will come to the issue of them being admitted to Hellfire that does not give us the justification to say that this Christian or this Jew is in hell this is a general description when we come to specific individuals like is John Doe a Christian is he in hell I don't know whoever dies as a Christian will go to hell okay what about John I cannot say this is anomalous knowledge maybe he accepted Islam before he died me bellari gave him an excuse or he had a legitimate reason but the general description all muslims will be in paradise is awesome in paradise you can't tell if I die you cannot say he's in paradise because this is a brain moraine specifics we cannot say in general or enough unless we have proof Abubakar without even thinking Rome our earth man Ali without even thinking those whom we are told in Jannah specifically we say in general Abu jahil in hell for out in hell we have no doubts in that but this is something else insha Allah okay I'm just warming up this is Shahada we still have a long way to go now our religion Islam is based on two very important principles taken from the Shahada de la hey la la hamid rasoolallah what are these two principles one sincerity true following the Prophet Elisha what does that mean it means that Allah does not accept any of your deeds unless these two conditions are fulfilled and if las sincerity la ilaha illallah and al atiba or amitabha in arabic we call it the following ship of the prophet alayhi salatu salam without following his footsteps Allah would not accept your deeds I have sincerity I have a class and I come to pray Maghrib for raka come on Roger is two blueberries for Azeris for Asia is for all even numbers why Madrid so add one what will that be invalid because I'm not following the footsteps of the prophet alayhi salaatu Sarah I innovate in the religion Allah would not accept this because I'm not following the prophet alayhi salaatu some these two conditions are mentioned in so many places in the Quran and it is clearly mentioned in the Sunna and if you want to know if Allah would accept you as a Muslim or not always look into your deeds are they in accordance to the Sunnah do I have sincerity why do I pray in a very nice way because my boss is watching I want an increment I want a bonus I want him to appoint me as a supervisor of my division that's I know that that's why I'm doing what I don't have hunchback but I I just do this so that he is impressed the deed is unaccepted I have sincerity but I'm not following the footsteps of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam I am innovating when I pray I said sincerity Allah Akbar what is this everybody's normal no I am premium I'm a high level of Deen and this means that I'm trying to reach Allah quickly this is innovation what are you doing he said you don't know what's in my heart I said yes but I know what I see when I am reena my race I mean who for who are odd whoever innovates in our religion was not part of it it is rejected so this is rejected by allah azzawajal and it won't do you any good and it is important and essential for the Shahada to be verbal it is not sufficient for a person to say Cara Saba Muslim I said it in my heart maybe maybe this would help hem with Allah but to us as Muslims he is considered to be what a disbeliever when he dies he dies a disbeliever there are some Muslims who accept Islam but do not go to the Islamic center do not go to the Masjid to announce it nobody knows that they're Muslim so we cannot consider them to be Muslim until they announce it but at the side of Allah this is something between them and Allah and Allah knows best so this is number one number two okay now all what he had said in Arabic is called a far more solid that's it um ah so that to establish and not to pray so part of the pillars of Islam is that you establish prayer which means that it is not sufficient to pray rather you have to follow doing it on time you have to do it's conditions and you have to pray it in the same format that the Prophet erase salatu salam had prayed it in salat linguistically what does it mean the centum dura which is supplication dura technically what does it mean what does salat technically means salat technically it is specific rhetorics and actions that are inaugurated they begin with a takbir and they're concluded with a salaam and performed in a special way at special times this is so this is technical definition of it when was it mandated the five daily prayers when was it mandated in the esra world Maharaj after hijra yes the saying yes before he drew before his aura the miraculous night journey some say it was a gift from allah azza wajal in compensation and in condolence for the death of his beloved wife Khadija and also his beloved uncle who died as a non-muslim Abu Polly so this is what some scholars say but it is mandatory upon every adult who has no obstacles preventing him from praying what are the obstacles that can prevent you from praying death well any no no I'll pass huh gyoon insanity okay so he's an adult but he's insane so this prevents him or prevents a lot to be obligatory upon him children they are not adult obstacles that come such as menses for women they are prohibited they prevented from praying because of this in Siddhartha continued Carnot a la shmoop me Nina Keith Urban no puta prayer is prescribed upon the believers on specific timings and it's very essential for us to know this why because a lot of the brothers and sisters especially here when they are cornered and don't have time to pray they celebrate Casa and some have the concept of Casa rumery you know what that concept is in the sub-continent in India and Pakistan they pray with every lover another whoa what is this says this is for lifetime maybe in the past I was a cat I did not pray so now I make Casa Oh Marie they continue to pray with every salat the same salat this is innovation this is not in Islam as for the timings it is not permissible for you to wait until the time is over unless there is a legitimate reason such as sleeping or forgetting forgetfulness the Prophet said Allah salatu salam whoever over sleeps or forgets a prayer must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no kuffara to it other than that now kuffara issue is usually done when you do what one don't waste my time please be quick when I ask you a question respond so that we can utilize the time kuffara is not done or it's not given except when what is done a sin you don't have to be a rocket scientist but sleeping is it sinful forgetting is it sinful they are hizzoner in Massena if we forget or make an error so why do I need an expiation scholars say that this is an emphasis from the Prophet array so that was Salam that if you sleep or forget the kuffara for these not to sins is separate immediately which means that if you abandon salat for other than these two reasons there is no kuffara and it will not be accepted from you even if you prayed other let me repeat I'm in the car I am driving the share to the hotel it's time for salat we don't stop Ayesha is approaching I did not pray Maghrib we don't stop until we reach the hotel and their issue and that is given is there a legitimate reason no can i pray Maghrib cover no and if you pray it will not be accepted from you because you deliberately skipped it I was in the car park and pray there is no soaps so what sera sera there is no surah there is no masala there is no Masjid he Allah made the ground for us a place of Prayer and purity wherever the salat is do you have to pray in the park on the street in the class in the corridor anywhere I'm a sister I cannot pray in the street why mashallah you are wearing hijab how people will look at me so what you're wearing hijab they're looking at you were you walking you have to pray you cannot delay the prayer for any reason other than life and death or a sleep bill you're asleep you're not accountable or you forget it happens in the best of families you have so happen you forgot but to just say oh I'm gonna miss Madrid yellow Manish what are you doing well I am working on a project well I am preparing the flyer for the conference will I we are doing Vicar and learning for ant FC if the Adhan of Risha is given you cannot pray Maghrib and if you pray it Allah who not accepted from you and a majority a great group of scholars said that you have become a kafir for skipping the salat deliberately salat is not a game this is a pillar of Islam you must not postpone it until the time runs out otherwise you are out and this is a serious thing this is why it is a little bit important to mention this to you through that on the day of judgement I will not laugh at you and you will not laugh at me because I did my job and Allah I gave you time there are conditions for salat correct what is the definition of condition your students of knowledge you should know that what is meant by condition hmm what no no condition in Islamic Sciences is something that is required for an action to be accepted that comes before the action and being there does not require the action to be done or not but being absent means that action is void so let me explain this in layman's term my term short who am Elias I am alone in lobby he condition of hatch is that I am a Muslim this is a precondition if a Christian company says well I am going for Hajj with you insha'Allah I'll go to our fr Moodle if I mean the whole nine yards he does everything like we do is it accepted from him why because the condition was not there now having the condition done and available does not mean that the action will be done one of the conditions of Hajj is to be a Muslim I'm a Muslim does this mean I'm going for Hajj this year next year the year after know the condition available does not mean that the action must be happening or taking place now salat requires conditions that has to be there in order for your salah to be accepted condition number one I need to hear you guys able I did not understand to be a Muslim okay this is the general condition but we want conditions of salat itself will go before that Nia you have to have the intention and Nia is disputed whether it's a condition or pillar part of the salat but the most authentic opinion it is something that is before salat so we have condition - we have pahala fahara has two meanings or divided not two minutes it is divided into two types one is uplifting the hadith - purification of the habit what does that mean Mahara means purity and purity is one part sentimental and other part is physical so let's begin with the physical part in order as a condition from a prayer to be accepted and valid I have to have purity physically in one my body - my clothes three place I'm praying in this is physical I have urine I can see it wash it it's gone I can pray my clothes same thing the spot this is what this is called is a little habit removing the filth removing the impurity this is half of Kihara the second half is sentimental is something that I cannot see who can tell if I'm in whoa bow or not anyone can tell that if I move in will bow or not no lights nothing you cannot tell I am a noodle by the way if I break my wooden who can tell this is something that is not physical we cannot tell that this and this is known as al-hadith l had that and it has two types major ritual impurity which results from ejaculation intercourse or menses or postnatal bleeding this is a blessed with what goosal you have to take total bath or we have the minor ritual impurity and this is uplifted with what with whoo do I will not go into details because this is not a class of but these are your Islam is not accepted without such knowledge you need to know these things because this is part of your ABC so we have two conditions now of salaat Nia and pájaro what else google it you have just google time time meaning that the time is due what time is the what o'clock if I come 1258 and I would like to pray my prayer is 1259 as long as prayer van is given at 1:00 sharp I cannot pray eight seconds earlier it has to be a beginning and it ends at a sir again this is the time for the and each salat has its own specific time you must pray in it unless exception if you're combining in the case of a traveler or someone in need number four huh direction-- give me a better word fibula fibula huh facing the Qibla so if someone knows the Qibla is there and he prays this way his prayer is invalid always no it can't be valid but facing the Qibla for a person praying for Allah and he's capable of doing it is a must if I'm travelling and I'm praying voluntary Sunnah I can pray anywhere so the Qibla is there and I'm headed to somewhere Genting I'm heading this way the criminal agent my back I pray Sunnah Lahore US or night prayer whatever I want for you but I have to face the tabla and come down from my car and part I went to a friend's house and it was time for prayer my friend was not there so I didn't know where the people are so I did this and I prayed when my friend came he said wrong table is this way should I repeat my prayer or socking I have to repeat because I did not exert all the effort that I can in knowing where it is and therefore my prayer is invalid but if someone did his level best he tried he called or a friend told me it's this way so I prayed because a Muslim told me it's this way after I finish it and create a mistake it's this way tough luck my prayer is valid the scene is on him I will not repeat not on you I do not repeat because I did my best I got the testimony of a Muslim this is sufficient by is there any Hamas conditional ah let's go finish our ah to expose your our is one of the conditions of salat true you're saying our house is to cover to cover your our is one of the conditions of the salat and the hour of male is from the knee till the bellybutton and for the women all of the women is our except her face and her hands in salat so if a sister wants to pray in home wearing her leggings and t-shirt but covering her head good no she has to wear the full abaya she has to cover herself even if home sisters called me share I'm alone and it's dark and the lights are off can I pray like this the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said Allah who does not accept the prayer of a woman who reached the age of puberty without a Hema she has to cover her whole body this is unacceptable so moving on should we move on Allah Allah this rate we're not going to finish five this is only the first hadith because when I started my research I spent so much effort and time and the rest is all one word two words and we'll finish the shot of the day don't worry any little vision by the way salat is the second pillar of Islam it is unlike any other form of worship at all in the sense that it was given to our Prophet Allah so - Salam in the seventh heaven and all was given on earth it was given directly by Allah and all the rest through gibreel peace be upon him it is the only deed in Islam that whoever abandons it leaves the fold of Islam and this is why the prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam between man and this belief or shirk abandoning salat what separates us from the disbelievers is a so that whoever abandons it he has left the fold of Islam and therefore it is extremely important to observe it not just to pray it but as the hadith stated were Obama salat to establish it our problem is that we all pray but do not have the spirit of prayer when we pray we pray with empty hearts we just do aerobics but without the contemplation you try to look at how we pray in front of people in the shroud shroud you should teach me how to speak the language and I should come here for a month and take a course at least and compare our salat in the message to our salat in our room when no one is watching what's the difference a big difference and in the message it we tend to pray in a different slow nice way but in my room I pray like a Ferrari from 0 to 105 seconds what what am i doing because I don't have the spirit of salat and this means that our Islam is not of conviction it is of imitation we've seen our parents pray we pray but we do not perfect our prayer when was the last time I entered at my parents room saw them praying and crying never they only cry when someone dies or something makes them cry but for from the fear of Allah we do not have this and this is very serious stuff number three to increase the girl that is obligation time okay zakat we will try to when is the break 11 serious no this is not good its own zakat is the third pillar of Islam it is extremely important again this is not affect a course but it is important to know that the cat is a certain percentage given on certain types of wealth to specific categories mentioned in surah at-taubah chapter 9 verse 60 at specific times the percentages can range from two point five five percent ten percent or even twenty percent these are all percentages of zakat and there are different categories we will not go into that and we will try to skip it question if a person does not pay the cut deliberately is he considered to be covered yes and the evidence Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him fought with apostates and mortar duelin who refused to give the cat after the death of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam I wish you did not say they say well are you making me tired this is a big issue of dispute among scholars whether abu bakr when he fought with the apostates for not giving as a cat he fought them because they were kafir or because they prevented giving by force what they're supposed to give to the muslim ruler and this is known as an antenna refraining from doing something that is mandatory as for the issue of someone who does not deliberately give the cat is he a kafir or not the most authentic opinion is that he is not a kafir he is committing a major sin big time so I stated this 10 minutes earlier but half of you were asleep I could tell I said it's the only deed that leaving it would consider to be tougher in Islam and that is a solid so one says okay but in the quran in surat al-baqara allah says in two places for in taboo what a commotion alotta Huerta was the cat for hello Sabina home for everyone who come 15 so Allah Azza WA JAL combined them both together he said yes from this ayah you correct who ever abandon salat or zakat he is not our brother indeed as in the ayah clearly but we as students of knowledge do not look at one specific evidence and neglect the other rather we have to do our research and in our research we find that the prophet sallallaahu re who seldom said that on the day of judgment no one who hoards what does hoard mean huh to keep not only to keep to hide and pile anyone who holds gold or silver and does not give its new meaning zakat what will happen on the day of judgment allah azza wajal will make plates of this gold and silver and to be burnt with fire and then his forehead his side his back would be burnt with these plates until he cools down then it will be repeated until the day of judgment and then and this is the punchline and then allah azza wajal would either forgive him or throw him in hell that he was a kafir there would not be any forgiveness he would be in hell for eternity so this is one of the evidences that scholar said makes an exemption for zakat not paying it deliberately from being an act of khufu as for Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him the most authentic opinion that he fought them because they did not do their due diligence they did not give what is due to the amel and they have fought against it with force iemon tamiya says the scholars of Islam say if the Muslim ruler came to a village and this village are Muslims but they refused to give the Adhan they pray he must fight them even if he has to kill them until they establish this Sharia of Islam so killing them and fighting them is not because their cafard but rather because they are fighting against a establishing one of the rules of Islam though they believe in it you got the point Sharla by Bruckner blabber yes hey yeah I performs Hajj this is known for us as Muslims you don't have to say Makkah because where are you gonna go definitely it is for a mecca so this is one of the pillars of Islam performing Hajj to Mecca the evidence in the Quran will add an essential vitamin e so far alayhi Sibylla allah azza wajal ordained has upon us and in the end the hadith the Prophet said in logic atiba are they come will Hajj Allah ordained that you perform Hajj one of the Companions stood up and said every year and this is very dangerous do not ask if there is no need to ask now the Prophet said Allah ordained Hajj have us leave it once is enough if you say every year and the Prophet says yes all of the ummah will be in his neck so the Prophet said Ali salatu salam to him if I said yes it would have been made mandatory every single year leave me as long as I leave you I don't address this point do not come into it so the Prophet said I'll had you once in a lifetime and whoever had this is volunteering and there are conditions for Hajj but we will not mention this due to the approaching time of the break number five okay again this is an explanation from the translator Karla's fasting everyone knows but this is sometimes essential for people who are not knowledgeable is fasting okay Monday Thursday three days every month Arafat Ashura should know know what we are talking here is a is what pillars of Islam which is Ramadan alone 30 days and fasting in Arabic means linguistically to refrain too so I'm fastening from talking this is fasting but link technically it is to refrain from whatever breaks your fast from the break of dawn until sunset with and this is very important condition with the intention of pleasing Allah because you can be on a diet I'm fat I'd like to lose weight so I'm fasting from eating and drinking and all things that break my fasting from break of dawn till sunset but is it for the sake of Allah no I'm just want to lose weight then this is not fasting it has to have this intention type I think that the rest is you all know it mashallah why didn't the Prophet Ali salatu salam mentions jihad isn't jihad something important in Islam the Prophet is also said that you were to say Nirmal Islam and jihad a sanam is the hump on the back of a camel and the highest of it the Prophet says if Islam was the camel the highest point of this hump is jihad so why isn't it mentioned here scholars say it is not mentioned because it is not mandated upon every individual it is Monday mandated upon those certain people who are either attacked or those who are off doing offensive jihad according to the order of the ruler the Muslim ruler secondly these will continue until the day of judgment while jihad will stop and cease when he said 'no Maryam comes with the grace of Allah Azza WA JAL at the end of time there will be no jihad and allah azza wajal knows best [Music] you"
