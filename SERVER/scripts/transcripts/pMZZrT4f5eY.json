  "title": "Are there Metaphors in the Quran? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mustafa from the Netherlands Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh And how can we know which verses are metaphors? Jazak Allah Khair Jazakum. The issue of metaphor is an issue of dispute among scholars. Some scholars like Sheikh Alsan Ibn Taymiyyah Because Quran is crystal clear. It was revealed in an Arabic tongue, language, which is understood by everyone. So this is one way of looking at it. Al mutashabihat which you referred to in contrast to al muhkamat. And this is very crystal clear to anyone who reads and understands the tafsir and Allah knows best."
