  "title": "Buy Connects for a job Upwork - Halal? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum, can you hear me? Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. And you are? Zakir from the UK. Okay, Zakir. What can I do for you, Akhi? I have a question related to permissibility of my work. So I have a doubt. I work in the infrastructure field, so basically managing and building servers and so on. There is a website called upwork.com where basically freelancers can join and search for work and apply by bidding for each specific job ad. In order to apply, in order to bid, you need a token called Kinex. And what is Kinex? So Kinex is a virtual token on this platform. It can be used to bid for each job ad, whether it's 4, 8, 12, 16, and so forth. My concern is, or the doubt is, if this Kinex is permissible in Islam. So by default, everything is halal unless proven otherwise. Suppose I spend $1.50 on my own pocket money to buy this 10 Kinex. Is it permissible? And then if I use this Kinex to bid for job ads, is my income halal? So let me ask you this. This token or whatever you're paying for, is it the fee in order for you to use this application in order to make such bids? Yes, so you use, for example, 8 token to bid or to make a proposal. So there's a job ad, someone has advised, someone has created an ad to make a server, for example. I would then say, OK, so from my own inventory, use those 8 Kinex to basically make a proposal. OK, so where does this token go to? It goes back to the platform. So sometimes I might get a response from the bidder, sometimes I might not. So it's like a win and a lose situation. They might like my proposal, they might not like my proposal. If this is a service fee that the application is charging in order for you to display your credentials and to propose or to bid for such projects, there is no element of gambling, in my view, because you're not putting or investing something. It's rather only a service fee as a rental port, to rent this portal to be able to use it. And inshallah, this is permissible and Allah knows best. For more information, visit www.fema.gov"
