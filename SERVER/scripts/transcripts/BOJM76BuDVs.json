  "title": "Status of Maternal Aunt in Islam? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US. What I wanted to ask you today was what is the status of maternal aunts in Islam? Jazak Allah Khairan. Maternal aunt is similar to your paternal aunt. They are part of your kinship that you're ordered in the Quran and of course in the sunnah to connect to by visiting, by calling, by helping if they need financial help. Because anyone related to you from your father or from your mother's side, he is from your kinship. And the maternal aunt is a mother as mentioned in the hadith. So she's close to you, as close as your mom. And she's closer to you than your paternal aunt in some cases. Due to the amount of time spent next to your maternal side of the family in most cases. Therefore yes, you have to honor her and connect to her because she's your mother's sister that Allah knows best."
