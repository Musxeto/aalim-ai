  "title": "Should I pray in Shafii Masjid Qunoot in Fajr or Hanafi Masjid Durood Nasheed since both have innova",
  "transcript": "Anwar from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is the area where I recite consists of multiple masjid based on Hanafi school of thought with the only exception that it contains only single masjid based on Shafi school of thought as both of the school of the thought does the innovation not like Hanafis where in my country they tilt towards the right after every Fajr prayer and recite the nasheed as a form of salutation to the Prophet ﷺ while the Shafi school of thought raise the or recite the Qunut in the second rakah of Fajr so in which masjid will you suggest me to pray and attend more the Fajr prayer oh definitely I would highly recommend that you pray in the Shafi masjid if there is no Ahli Hadith masjid around you then the Shafi doing the Qunut in the second rakah is not from the Sunnah though the Prophet did that for one month alayhis salatu wassalam and he stopped and he never continued to do that and this is why the three schools of thought say that this is not from the Sunnah we don't do it only the Shafi school of thought does this yet it is not as an innovation as offering salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ after the conclusion of the set of the prayers and making congregational dua this is a clear-cut innovation may Allah protect us all"
