  "title": "Can we pray Ishraq at home as the masjids are not open due to lockdown? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "ali says can we pray ishraq at home because the masjids are not open as for the reward that the prophet alaihis allah placed upon a certain task which is one hajj one umrah this is only limited to the conditions set by the prophet allah which is a person who prays fajr in congregation remains in the masjid until the sun rises and then prays to raka so scholars say that this reward of one hajj one umrah perfect perfect perfect is conditional and the conditions are to be prayed in congregation in the masjid nevertheless the reward of praying fajr remaining in your position in your home making dhikr until the sun rises and you pray to rakhas is also highly rewardable i don't know of any of the companions may allah be pleased with them that would not follow this in the hadith the prophet isaiah once left home to pray fajr while his wife was in a position of prayer and came back after sunrise and she was still in the same position making dhikr so the prophet said i said four words meaning four statements that would equal all the time that you had spent from fajr till now that's it so it indicated that the mother the mothers of the believers used to pray fajr and stay where they are making thicker until the sun rises so this is highly recommended but it does not have the same reward as doing it in the masjid and offering the two rakahs after sunrise so would ishraq be prayed at home similarly to the to the masjid and get the same reward as there is no"
