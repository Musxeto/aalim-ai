  "transcript": "What is the view of Shiekh Ibn Othaimeen \nregarding the excuse of ignorance   this is a big issue of dispute and Shiekh \nIbn Othaimeen may Allah have mercy on his   soul is one of the late contemporary \nScholars of the Great Scholars of all   and his writings and his ideas and the way he \nexplained things befits only an excellent teacher   which he was may Allah have mercy on his soul he \nexplains that ignorance is a legitimate excuse   and if it was not an excuse Allah would not \nhave sent The Messengers this is the purpose of   sending the messengers to uplift this ignorance \nand to educate people and to make them know and he says there is no difference between   ignorance in related materials to aqeedah or to \npractical issues so whether it's in aqeedah or in   fiqh it's the same thing as long as a person \nis ignorant then he is Exempted and excused   and there is no difference in matters or issues \nthat are apparent to some but hidden from others   so when Scholars say that this is oh so apparent \nno whoever does this even if he's ignorant he's a   kaffir as long as the ignorance is there this is \na legitimate excuse who knows whether this person   is ignorant or not Allah so he's the one who \njudges him in this Dunya we judge with what we see   but it's Allah azzawajal who judges people \non the day of judgment now to nullify a   person's Islam this can be done by conviction \nby action by rhetoric and in all these things   we have no problem in saying that this is \nan act or a statement or a belief of kufr   the problem is when you want to implement \nthis ruling on a specific individual   this is where we have to draw the line and \nsay wait a minute are the conditions fulfilled are there any obstacles that prevent us from \nlabeling this individual as a kafir if yes then we   have to judge accordingly because the Hadith which \nis in the sahih of a man who ordered his children   to criminate cremate him after his death and \nthen spreading and throwing his ashes on the   top of the hills and the bottom of the valleys \nand the over the oceans and justifying this by   saying for if Allah was able to resurrect \nme he would have tormented me severely   this is a statement of kufr if you \nthink that Allah is unable to do that   so the prophet tells us that Allah ordered the \nhills and the valleys and the oceans to gather   this man's remains and he stood in front of him \nand Allah asked him oh my servant why have you   done what you've done and he said because I was \nafraid of you oh Allah so this man was ignorant and Allah said I have forgiven your sins \nif he was a mushrik if he was a kafir Allah   would not have forgiven him we know that for \na rule and in fact but Allah excused him and   pardoned him because of his of his ignorance \nor of his misinterpretation and understanding   of the rulings or because of his excessive \nfear and this is in the hands of Allah so   this is what Sheikh Ibn Othaimeen thinks \namong other things that Allah Knows Best foreign have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford \nit that's good for you if you cannot you're   entitled for one free session and this is for \neverybody if they can affirm by Allah that they   cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give \nthem one free session without a problem a full   half an hour so come to me and let's speak \nabout it inshallah within the following two   days or three days I will try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
