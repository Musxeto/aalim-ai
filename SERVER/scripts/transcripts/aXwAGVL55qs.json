  "title": "ðŸ†•âœ¨ How Thumb should touching ear in Wudu? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "So brother Yunus from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. If I wipe my ears like like you told me and my thumb only touches two-thirds of my outer ear, is this okay because my ear is wider than my thumb or not? So if it touches four quarters of four-fifths of your ear, is it okay or not? Yunus? Yunus? Yes. If it touches four-fifths? Most likely. Okay, three-quarters? Maybe. Half? Probably. I don't know. So what's the logic of me asking you these questions? You're saying I'm overthinking. I'm saying that what is mandatory is to wipe and this is the sunnah. What percentage is not mentioned? So whatever counts as wiping, does the job. For example, we're ordered in the Qur'an to wipe over our heads. Now definitely I'm not going to wipe every strand of hair. So what's the percentage? It's not mentioned. Whatever counts as wiping, does the job. So if you do this with your ear and you move on, it's what Allah Azza wa Jal told you to do. You don't have to go to details. As they say, the devil is in the details."
