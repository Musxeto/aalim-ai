  "transcript": "and we have abu muhat from the uk i need some advice regarding my son inshallah next year he will start year 7 so i have two option one is public school and another is islamic school and i have done some study on two islamic school one is cool they're just full of pitha and another is called just one example the students are not allowed to wear the trouser above the ankle they must wear the trouser below the ankle my question is like uh i'm in a dilemma what should i do in this situation should i choose my for my son like one of the school forms the privacy of islamic school or the public school abu mohammad from the uk he's in a dilemma his son is seven and now he's at the crossroad whether to take him to public schools or to take him to an islamic school that has innovation now personally speaking without going into details you have to weigh the pros and cons so if the pros of the islamic school that has innovation outweighs the public school which usually is the case then you have to take him to the islamic school until it reaches a level where there is a threat on his akida on his islamic practice in this case homeschooling is the best public schools the students are placed in an environment that would melt them down and this is the purpose and the main reason for having public schools everywhere in such non-islamic countries is to blend all cultures all communities into a one melting pot and this is what explains some european countries enmity clear enmity only towards islam not judaism not christianity they only target islam publicly and they claim that to be democratic they close masjids and their ministers proudly speak of closing messages islamic centers raiding homes of the muslims why simply because the people want to honor their identity and religion no this is a taboo you cannot wear the niqab in these countries you can wear a bikini you can wear a thung in the middle of the chandelier no problem but not any cup why because this defies the purpose of melting everybody into their kufur ideology to honor your islam to honor your own religion and belief this is taboo so public schools usually go against all what we believe sexual education free mixing um darwinism the whole nine yards and this is why it is important to protect our children from such environments now if the islamic school has mistakes if this islam school has mistakes we have to go and try to correct them advise them bring scholars to speak to them and reduce the harm to a level that is acceptable and the issue of not wearing the trousers below above the ankles this is unheard of why would anyone order muslims to go against the orders of the prophet allah even if you disagree with the concept the hadith is krishna clear is in buhari muslim well nobody does this except someone who's a hypocrite or has hatred against islam but you still can't take your child there order him whenever they're not watching to fold it do something over and over they will get accustomed to it at the end of the day they're still better than public schools and alano's best"
