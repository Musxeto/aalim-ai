  "transcript": "by brother abdullah my question is do we muslims believe in cavemen well depends what do you mean by believing in cavemen if you believe it is part of the theory of evolution and what darwin came up with saying that men evolved from monkeys and uh the likes of course not we believe that humanity began with adam and hawwa peace be upon them adam and eve this is how humanity began allah created them not out of monkeys or chimpanzees evolving to them they were created so this is how humanity started whether they lived in cave caves or under a tree or in mansions this is beside the point so people usually mention cavemen where they refer to a man grabbing a woman by the hair and pulling her behind him being an animal-like being a guerrilla-like no we don't believe in such things but did humanity at some stage of time manage to live in caves because they did not have tents or houses this is probable but not as they are portrayed to us like in the flintstones for example and the likes and allah knows best you"
