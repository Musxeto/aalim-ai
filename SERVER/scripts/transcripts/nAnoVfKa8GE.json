  "transcript": "uh okay uh what is the ruling on youtube income i believe that it is haram because i wish it was halal i have subscribers so i could have yeah make three thousand dollars four thousand dollars of ads every month but the problem is when you allow them to monetize it they will have to put advertisement that you don't have any control of today i just received a message from one of my followers saying your video clip was posted on an x satellite channel islamic satellite channel youtube and they had before your clip an ad with a woman in a bikini send me a copy please no i didn't say that but i see see the problem is he's saying sheikh talk to this channel and is so if we can control it we would have loved it but no halal money one penny is better than a hundred thousand of haram you know when they when these things came up one of the brothers said why don't you share your ticket so subhanallah i watch some of this stuff i think we did it just for 10 days after that i said call it off actually i found ads about christianity like they they they want wow to be a christian missionary kind of ads you know so i i i it's 100 percent um allah"
