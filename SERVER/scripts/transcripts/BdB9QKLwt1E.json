  "transcript": "Safi says is buying a car and paying in installments for eight years with four point ninety nine percent interest halal we've been reading online that as long as the monthly installments payments agreed upon don't change for eight years as well as the interest rate then this is permissible car is forty five thousand plus taxes and interest and the full price becomes fifty six thousand that fifty six thousand will be split monthly over eight years and monthly payment never changes the answer is yes this is basically Hallett c to buy something in installments you have to have two conditions one that who you're buying it from actually owns the product so he is not a facilitator or a third party or a financier rather he is the owner of the product condition number two is before we sign the contract the final price has to be fixed regardless of the interest added to it rather the profit added to it so if it's like forty five thousand and he says I'd like to sell it to you for ninety thousand double the price no problem as long as we've agreed upon this and it cannot be ninety one increased in the future ninety is fixed I sign he signs the duration is fixed even if I exceed the duration he would not put a penalty on me he can't we've agreed on ten years that I pay him monthly I defaulted in two or three payments the price remains the same I'm sinful he can take me to court but the price remains the same not a single a dollar or euro over the ninety thousand that we agreed upon so these different two conditions if they were fulfilled then yes there's no problem I can tell you this pen to Ally for one reel and I can sell it to Emmett for 10 riyals all in cash I met has no right to object and say why do you sell a D for a reel and sell it to me for 10 reals I said this is my pen if I wish I can give it to Ally for free and if I wish I could sell it to you for a hundred it's up to you whether you accept or not but at the end of the day it's my pen so whether I sell it in cash for a real or I sell it in installments for ten reals as long as I'm the owner and as long as before the transaction is finalized the final price is sat and not to be increased then there's no problem in that insha Allah who as what gel"
