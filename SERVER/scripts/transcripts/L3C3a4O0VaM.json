  "transcript": "Aon from Bangladesh ion uh sh alhamdulillah Allah has blessed me with a good physique but the problem is whenever I go in front of people or any person passes me I correct my posture or pump my chest or Flex muscles so that I look good and my also whenever I wear a shirt that makes me a little creep then I intentionally go out so people can see me I always express gra gratitude in my heart and I don't do it to humiliate others but I do it because I feel good is it Ria or will I be sinful for this okay first of all Rya is related to Good Deeds or forms of worship that you anticipate the praise of human beings for for it so when I give 50 in charity and I want people to see it to impress them this is R but if I have a Ferrari and I rev the engine so that people would look at me this is not R this is showing off just something that's human all of us I we have our Hench back and when we see people coming from the gym or bodybuilders we stand straight and yeah how you doing you're tough you're rough and try to have a strong grip the moment he walks away we go back to our normal posture this is normal this is nothing to do with r but any it's it's something that we all humans want to look good and it makes us feel good when people uh praise how we look or how um our posture is so there's no Ria in that and Allah Knows Best"
