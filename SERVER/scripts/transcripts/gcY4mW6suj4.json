  "transcript": "Khamees from the Emirates. Is the sujood valid if hands are on the ground but next to the knees? They're not next to the ears or shoulder, they're next to the knees. The Prophet ï·º said, as in the hadith of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with the man with his father, I was ordered to prostrate on seven limbs. He said the forehead and pointed to his nose, meaning the forehead and the nose. The hands, the knees and the feet. So the sunnah as we know is to place your hands and put your head in between them in sujood and if you put them a little bit back next to your shoulders that is even fine, no problem. If someone puts them next to his knees, this is not according to the sunnah. But did he prostrate on seven limbs? The answer is yes. Then the prostration is good but he is not following the sunnah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
