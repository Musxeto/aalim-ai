  "transcript": "a sister says if a woman has intercourse and right after learns she just got her period is she's supposed to take a whistle now after intercourse the woman is in the state of sexual major impurity before making whistle she got her period so either way she is not going to pray so why do you recommend that she performs also if she did not perform whistle yes she's not gonna pray she's not gonna fast there's no problem and her going anywhere she's not going to enter the Masjid because by default she is in her menses and a woman in her menses does not enter the message then what is the problem the problem is with reciting the Quran a woman in her sexual major ritual impurity is not allowed to recite the Quran not touch it I'm talking about just reciting it this is prohibited for anyone male or female in the state of janaba so a woman in her menses because of its duration of six or seven or more days and nights she is permitted to recite the Quran and to revise it to memorize it the whole nine yards no problem at all but the problem is with reciting it for the one in sexual impurity major ritual impurity there for such a question the answer to it would be that yes if a woman who had intercourse with her husband gets her menses before doing her hustle she is obliged to make her hustle just in order to recite the Quran to be able to recite the Quran it has nothing to do with her menses"
