  "title": "Can I make Dua in Sujood in my own language? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We have brother Sirajullah from Turkey. I have a question. In sujood after Subhanallah Rabbil Ala, can we make duas in our own language? The answer is if you do not know how to do a particular dua in Arabic because the vast majority of scholars say that you have to only use Arabic in Salat. However, the most authentic opinion is if I want to ask Allah Azza Wa Jal to pay off my debt, I don't know how to say that in Arabic, so I can use my native language to ask Allah to pay off my debt. If I want to ask Allah to forgive my sins, I know how to say Rabbigfirli, so I cannot say that in my native language. I must say it in Arabic. I hope this answers your question. That's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
