  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia my nearest mid is about uh 27 minutes from my home by walking but only about 700 M in a straight line but it is located on a hill is it permissible to pray at home as long as it is not easy for you to access it if it's going to take you 27 minutes to reach there the answer is no even if it is 7 100 MERS away from your home you cannot reach it so what counts as reaching it is the distance that you would walk to it and Allah Knows Best"
