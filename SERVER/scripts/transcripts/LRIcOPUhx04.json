  "transcript": "Maham from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu So my question is that I follow Sheikh Ibn Baz and I read his fatwa that he said it's not permissible for women to wear abayas that start from the shoulder but in my country it is not common for women to wear Saudi abayas that start from the head and almost all women wear just normal abayas so I'm confused about that because I don't want to stand out like outside so Okay first of all Sheikh Abdul Aziz Ibn Abdullah Ibn Baz may Allah be have his mercy upon him is one of the great imams of Islam he was the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia and he is well respected in all countries of the world and he died like 20 plus years ago or something like that so if you're following him and he's your imam and sheikh you should continue to follow him now if you want to understand why he said this he said this alongside with many other scholars because wearing your outer garment on your shoulders see when I wear my top uh gear my head gear like this you can't tell what's the width of my shoulders you'd probably think I'm short I'm clumsy and fat maybe that's true you never know and this is good because it disguises the shape of a person and with women it's way way best rather if I wear it underneath like this now you can tell the width of my shoulders you can see it and you can identify my physique and with women it's way way more dangerous and this is why the scholars saying wearing it on your shoulders it would resemble the black robe that men in the gulf area wear with the golden straps on the sides so wearing it this way would resemble men as some scholars say which I beg to differ because it's totally different what they wear compared to what men wear nevertheless it does expose their body shape so the best and more convenient is to wear this what we call balto or it's like a lab coat that women wear black which covers them properly but in order to avoid exposing their shoulders and bosoms and the likes they wear a khimar which is a head gear that has an opening for the face where they wear and it falls and covers them to their waists so it is as if they're wearing the abaya on the head and it conceals their shoulders and their body shape perfectly and it gives them the freedom of movement unlike the abaya that is worn on the head that may hamper their movement and restrict it and Allah Azzawajal knows best you"
