  "transcript": "Ibrahim from the emirates, He says he's going \nto study abroad in Ireland and they like have   a lease contract for the rent of the apartment \nhe's renting and they have a late payment penalty.   If this is in all the places and the buildings and \nin the residential areas you're applying for and   this is the norm in the country you have no other \nalternative because you can't live on the streets   so you have to opt for it but I would \nhighly recommend that you pay up   in advance so that you would never reach \na point where you find out that you don't   have money or is going to come after a week or \ntwo and it's late due to covered or whatever   and then end up having this riba occurring in \nyour account so if there's no other alternative   it's the norm and the law of the country \nyou can go for it but pay in advance."
