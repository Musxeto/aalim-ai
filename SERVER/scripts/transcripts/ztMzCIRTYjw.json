  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the US So my question is from the past couple of days \nI've been going through a difficult time in my   life where I'm not able to focus and my daily \nlife is being affected like yesterday I was in   my room in a dark room, I was not speaking \nto anybody, in the night I could not sleep,   I was moving my body was moving because of \nrestlessness, and I was roaming around the room,   I don't know why, and it feels like as if I know \nthis life is eventually gonna end, but it feels   like it's gonna last forever and when I look at \nthe Kuffar I sometimes feel jealous while I know   that this is only for them in this Dunya, but \nI still can't help it I don't know what to do Okay first of all there are things \nin life that need conviction   and not only knowledge, so we all know \nthat we are eventually going to die,   no one has any doubt at all even the \ndisbelievers, even the richest men on Earth,   you go to them, and they say yeah death is \ninevitable ,everybody is going to die, nobody   has ever lived forever okay what are you gonna do, \nsaid nothing, I'm going to continue to be a tyrant   to abuse those who work for me, to deal in Riba, \nI'm going to continue to oppress people and buy   their businesses and make them broke, I'm \ngoing to ruin people's lives, I don't care,   don't you believe that you're gonna die, I said \nyeah, so even go to the Muslims you believe in   life and after death, said yes, you believe \nyou're going to die, definitely you believe   in heaven and hell, said most certainly I'm a \nMuslim, then why are you not praying on time,   why do you fornicate, why do you drink \nwhy do - alcohol that is, intoxicants,   why do you smoke [ ], why do you abuse your wife, \nwhy do you disobey your husband, why do you not respect your parents, why do you \nsteal money, why do you - so many things,   and they acknowledge, say yeah yeah we \nknow it's Haram, and we know it's bad but   [ ], don't you believe that you're going to be \ntormented in your grave, they said I believe in   the torment of the grave, but I'm not one of those \nbut you're doing the whole nine yards I said yeah,   but I believe in Allah's Mercy and what about \nAllah's punishment no, no this is for the   disbelievers, we are not going to be tormented, so \nit's not knowledge that people lack its conviction   that drives them and pushes them to do the \nright thing, now you have the knowledge,   but you don't have the conviction and the \nreason might be attributed to so many factors   it can be attributed to lack of trust, dependence, \nand Reliance on Allah. known as tawakkul,   if you had Tawakkal on Allah, dependence on \nAllah, you know that he would take care of you, so   you would not have these anxiety fits and attacks, \nyou wouldn't be restless, whatever Shaytan hits   your head you say I have Allah Azzawajal with me, \nhe's my protector, it can be attributed to your   lack of belief, weakness of belief in the Divine \ndecree which is one of the six pillars of Imaan,   if you believe that Allah has written down \neverything that's going to happen till the day   of judgement and that was 50 000 years before \ncreating the whole universe, so it's done,   whatever we're going to do it's been written, \nwhatever is going to happen it's written, if   someone dies among our loved ones it was written \n50 000 years ago am I saddened, definitely yes,   but would I do something that would be considered \nto be complaining, objecting, or any sort of   not being content, at all, because I believe that \nthis is something that Allah has predestined,   so there are so many factors that \nmay attribute to how you feel,   how to cure this, and how to get \nrid of it, by reading the Quran,   I read the Quran Sheikh, you're not reading \nit with your heart, you're just reciting it   with your tongue, I want you to read it with your \nheart, Allah says in the Quran to his messenger. We reveal to you from the Quran what makes your \nheart steadfast, so if it makes the prophet's   heart steadfast when it's restless, and we know \nthe calamities that the prophet had faced then   by default if we believe, and we read the \nQuran, our heart would be content and calm,   we will find the tranquillity and the peace in \nthe Quran because it is to our hearts like honey   to our bodies, the best antibiotic, the \nbest medication to your whole body is honey,   C ure is in it as mentioned in the Quran \nto most illnesses and diseases, so whatever is happening to you [Questioner] you \nhave to acknowledge a universal fact and I   always reiterate and say it over and over again, \nevery single individual on Earth is being tested,   some are tested with wealth, some are tested with \nhealth, others are tested with poverty and with   Illness, so each one of us has \nhis own calamity, don't ever be deceived by how things look, don't go and \nlook at the richest man on the on earth,   oh he builds spaceships, or he travels to \nspace he has so much money he does this,   he does that, Wallahi he is the most or \none of the most miserable people on earth,   don't be deceived by his smile by his constant \ndosages of tranquillisers whether physical or   sentimental and mental, they're just living in \noblivious because they know they're going to die,   and they know what awaits them after death \nbut this world, this wealth is so lucrative   and deceptive that they're unable to make a \ndecisive decision to make an end of it and work   to whatever is after death, yeah they may put in \ntheir [ ] put me in nitrogen liquid or put me in   the freezers or maybe somebody would discover in \n200 years how to give life after death which is   illogical they may do this, but they \nare the most miserable people on Earth,   everyone is being tested, the prophets and \nMessengers were tested peace be upon them,   the righteous and the companions were tested, \nso you're not alone, you're being tested,   now what the results of your test may be, this \nwhat will with the grace of Allah Define you   and this is what would most likely lead you \nto Paradise if you're among the righteous and   the patient or elsewhere may Allah protect \nus all if you're not and Allah Knows Best."
