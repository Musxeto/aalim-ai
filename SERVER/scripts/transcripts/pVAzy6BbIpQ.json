  "transcript": "[Music] can [Music] ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam the Hadith we are to discuss today is one of the most important hadiths in Islam and this is known as the Hadith of bash may Allah be pleased with him and with his father where the Prophet saysat that which is lawful is clear and that which is unlawful is clear and between them are doubtful matters that many people do not know whoever avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard of his religion and his honor but whoever falls into doubtful matters falls into the unlawful Like a Shepherd who grazes near a restricted area on the verge of trespassing truly every King has a sanctuary and Allah Sanctuary is what he has forbidden indeed in the body there is a piece of Flesh which if sound the entire body will be sound and if corrupted the entire body will be corrupted truly it is the heart this Hadith was reported by Imam bukari and IM Muslim in theah so it's the highest grade of authenticity Imam Ahmed may Allah have mercy on his soul says the religion revolves around three hadiths the Hadith of Omar verily Deeds are judged by intention the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her whoever innovates in our Affairs what's not part of it it is rejected and thirdly and finally the Hadith of and in this the prophet sallallahu wasam divides issues pertaining to religion into three categories pure Halal pure lawful such as eating fruits and vegetables eating has slaughtered meat dealing in selling and buying stuff wearing different types of fabrics and clothes these are normal things that are Halal get get married studying working earning renting buying and selling these are pure Halal nobody has a doubt in it unless someone is having mental issues when people come to you and say she what's the ruling on drinking water after the sun sets in Ramadan why oh because maybe after I drink water I would feel heavy and I won't be able to pray no this is ridiculous this is a mental illness so Halal things are crystal clear and there are category number two Haram things that are crystal clear in the sense that consuming dead meat pork consuming intoxicants wine and the likes abandoning prayer and not praying and offering them wearing of silk and gold for men this is Crystal Clear there's no doubt in it fornication dealing with where it's clearly stated Allah made transactions of selling and buying Halal and made dealing with r incest marrying your sister your daughter your mother all of these things are crystal clear to any Muslim you don't have to ask about it but then there is the third category and this is where the Prophet saysat and between them are doubtful matters so why are they doubtful because they may be inclined to one of the two Halal Oram and due to the fact that it's dubious it's doubtful it's something that I'm confused about it doesn't mean that it is confusing by itself it means that you do not know the ruling of it but to some it is crystal clear and this is why the prophet saidat many people do not know which means that they're is a category of the people who knows the ruling why would it be doubtful some issues the evidence that backs it up is doubtful to some so they may think that the evidence is is not authentic the Hadith is not reliable maybe maybe the evidence is authentic it's a verse from the Quran or it's an authentic Hadith in the but they think that it does not mean what other people think it means maybe it is authentic and it means what it means clearly they think that it might be abrogated with another evidence and they have this evidence they think that the Hadith is General but there are specifics that would make it an exception and Exempted from it like when Allah says it is prohibited for you dead meat and blood there is an ex something that is Exempted there is an exception what fish when the fish floats on the water it's dead I can eat it though it's dead as mentioned in the Ayah but this is generic generally everything that is dead is Haram that is not slaughtered with the exception of seafood blood the spleen and the liver their blood but these are Exempted because the prophet said that this is Hal for us so these dubious thing or doubtful things they depend on how a person looks at them now having said that this is not referring to Layman people that don't know Arabic never read the T don't memorize the Quran never done a course in or in in or in Hadith or in the likes they're not qualified to come and talk about anything pertaining to religion they're ignorant imbeciles they have no knowledge it's like them speaking about something in in in electricity electrical engineering or in neurosurgery and they've never done a course in that they can't speak about these things they're not qualified the Hadith is referring to people of knowledge where the Prophet says many people do not know of IM explains that it can be confusing to some more than others but there will be always people that understand people of knowledge Scholars because Allah Asel did not leave us in chaos not knowing what to do this is impossible Allah revealed the Quran to us and sent the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to us to explain it and to elaborate upon it and to give us the rulings and teach us so he left us on a crystal clear platform as he said in the Hadith I've left you on a white spread sheet where the night is is crystal clear and the daytime is cryst Crystal Clear you can distinguish between them so everything in the religion has been clarified however the vast majority of Muslims may find dubious things doubtful things that they're unable to understand due to their confusion and lack of knowledge the scholars come in and they would explain it to us then the prophet said says Alam whoever avoids doubtful matters meaning once you're confused and in a dilemma and you don't know the ruling avoid that which is dubious and doubtful whoever avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regards to his religion and his honor what does that mean when you leave doubtful things you're not close to doing something Haram therefore no one would Point his finger says Oh look The Sheikh is doing something dubious the Sheikh is falling into something Haram rather you clear your religion so nobody says this person's religion is Kami no and no one says that anything that would tarnish your honor what is meant by Honor the word in Arabic the is something that every individual of us has where it can be praised and tarnished both ways so your reputation when someone says bad things about you they are talking about your when someone Slanders your wife they're talking about your when someone Praises you then he's uplifting your he's doing something good so the honor which is in Arab is the place of criticism and praise and that is why it is as I rajab says it is essential to clear your reputation your honor and to clear your name this is an essential part of Islam in the farewell speech the prophet says your wealth your uh uh blood your your lives and your reputation your honor is Haram you should not violate this so to defend your honor is a huge and great achievement and requirement of you to do and doing so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gave us a clear example when he was walking once at night with mother safia his wife and it was Ramadan and he was in in seclusion in the Masjid and she came and spoke to him so she he walked her back to her Chambers while walking with her two of the companions saw him and the moment they saw him with the woman they turned their back and went away this is what normal people would do if I see you with your wife I won't come and embrace you and hug you and chitchat with you while you're your wife is sitting have some shame have some honor I don't do this when I see you with your wife I just say from a distance alaykum if you want to come and leave your wife and talk that's fine when the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam saw them walking away he called them he said listen this is my wife safia he identified her because she was all in black from head to toe so they said oh prophet of Allah Subhan Allah would we doubt you yeah why would you say that she and identify her he said I was afraid that Satan May throw something in your heart and you would doubt me and you would be qualified to enter Hellfire because of that I just wanted to save you from Hellfire so pure purifying C clearing your honor is a prerequisite it's something that is required in Islam okay so we have to stay away from doubtful things why the prophet saysat if you don't clear your religion and reputation and Honor by staying away from doubtful things but whoever falls into doubtful matters will fall into the he will fall into the unlawful why would that be because when you are in the proximity of Haram you're inevitably going to fall in it and this is why Allah says in the Quran don't come close to fornication Don't Come Close he did not say Do not fornicate when he talked about intoxicant he said stay away from it he did not say don't drink it which means don't be don't even be within the circle that such Haram is being committed fornication he did not say Do not fornicate he said don't approach it so even Haram gaze a look touch a smell listening to whatever may get you closer to it you've got to refrain from it this is the essence of protecting your religion and your honor and your reputation and then the prophet gives Alat an example so that we could understand things he said Allah has limits has boundaries over the things that are Haram and it is like a sanctuary every King has a sanctuary whether it is his own or it's for the state if it's for the state and the cattle that grazes in it belongs to the Muslims we have no problem if it is his own then this is Haram because he must not block the Muslims from Grazing In Allah's grass Allah's lands but this is a side issue so the prophet is telling us the things that Allah has prohibited and made unlawful are like the sanctuary which a king has he set the borders in the limits so that no one would cross and graze in it why because if you do trespass they will confiscate your cattle because it went into a place it should not have gone to now the cattle sees the sanctuary the grass is tall and it looks nice and delicious and it's a it's an animal it doesn't understand it will go when the shepherd is not careful and he's grazing close to the sanctuary inevitably will happen the inevitable will happen and once it does his cattle will be confiscated because he fell into the unlawful it's the same thing with Haram when you're close to Haram and thinking that no I'm safe there's still some limitation I know my limits like so many people think and inevitably they would fall into Haram Allah says these are the limits set by Allah so do not approach them and this is for any thing that Allah has set as Halal or Haram you should not approach it then the prophet goes on to speak sallallahu alaihi wasallam about the heart indeed in the body there is a piece of Flesh and he said m a piece of Flesh to indicate that the size of it compared to the rest of the body is negligible it's very small yet this piece of flesh is the controller of the whole body as we talked about yesterday the prophet says if sound the entire body will be sound and if corrupted the entire body will be corrupted truly it is the heart so a sound heart is what makes your body Sound by doing what Allah has commanded by refraining from what Allah has prohibited and this Hadith indicates that what fills the heart is the word this is the essence ofed when your sound heart is filled only with the love of Allah the fear of Allah the Hope in Allah the Trust In Allah the dependence on Allah invoking Allah seeking protection from Allah subhah wa taala acknowledging who Allah is the beautiful names and attributes of Allah fills your sound heart this Hadith is one of the most authentic hadiths that talk about the importance of the heart and how great the dangers of tarnishing it and making it fall sick and it can fall sick in a heartbeat in the blink of an eye it's so vulnerable so fragile if you don't take care of your heart it will easily be defected and it can die so by doing what Allah commands you and staying away from what Allah has prohibited you you clear your religion you clear your reputation and you will be among those whom Allah has chosen we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
