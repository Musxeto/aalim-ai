  "transcript": "fetcher says how to know if I'm affected by evil eye evil eye is something that a person whether good or bad may inflict it upon you upon seeing something he likes whether intentionally and usually it is unintentional tended so I see someone driving a fancy car and I said whoa what a beautiful car or I see someone working out in the gym and I said look at the weight he is bench pressing my god this guy's a monster now this is evil eye I have no intention of him being sick or of him losing his powers or of him having an accident but the evil spirit in me came out unintentionally so he says how to know if I'm affected by evil eye first of all 95% of those thinking of themselves to be possessed with jinn having evil eye sorcery envy whatever they are delusional they are imagining things but these things are a fact and they happen but not to that extent if my wife is nagging she's possessed with Jen if my daughter fails the exam it's an evil eye if my son falls sick its Envy its if I lose my job it's black magic not to that extent every thing that happens we blame it upon these things but it's true evil eye is true so how do I know that I'm affected by it I personally do not know anything from the Quran or Sun and that tells us it is usually an illness so if someone has all of a sudden developed migraine or he has stomachaches or he fell sick or he has fever and it's the doctors say there's nothing wrong with it this is most likely to be evil I other than that they say that a lot of sweating that is new or urinating a lot or shivering or having bad nightmares etc change of the color feeling unwell when reading or reciting or listening to the Quran etc these can be also symptom Susannah lazarul knows best"
