  "title": "Sujood as Sahu for Mistake in Takbir of Movement",
  "transcript": "Anas from Canada Ya Anas Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my question is about Takbeeratul Intiqan and Salat When I make Takbeer before I move or like before I make the Ruku' or after I finish Ruku' or Sujood Not along the movement Do I, out of forgetfulness, do I need to make Sujood Dassa? Okay, a lot of the scholars emphasize that the place of Takbeeratul Intiqal or the Takbeer of movement is between the pillars So if I'm going from the standing position to Sujood I don't say Allahu Akbar and then I move like so many Imams do just to ensure that their voices are beautifully relayed through the microphone This is ignorance from their side Some other Imams postpone the Takbeer until they reach the ground and they say while in Sujood So that people would not rush and race them And both are wrong The Sunnah of the Prophet ï·º was to be said in between So once you start moving you say Allahu Akbar and you end the R usually when your forehead is about to hit the ground And once the Imam's forehead hits the ground only then the followers start to bend their backs They don't start to bend their backs and knees the moment the Imam moves No, they wait until his forehead touches the ground as per the Sunnah This is why some scholars said if the Imam fails to say the Takbeer at the right time So he says it while standing or when he reaches the other position his prayer is invalid And to invalidate someone's prayer you need evidence You just can't speak out of thin air and say your prayer is invalid No, this is not logical nor permissible And also to say that you have to perform Sujood for such a mistake or such a movement Intentional action needs also a Dalil or an evidence to back it up So I'm inclined to say that such a person such an Imam is wrong Yet the prayer is valid and there is no requirement or need for Sujood And Allah Azzawajal knows best"
