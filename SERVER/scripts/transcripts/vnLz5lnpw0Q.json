  "transcript": "i'm asking about divorce when does divorce count is it when immediately after the uttering you are divorced or is it after her edda period if a woman is in her edda then it's cancelled is that also considered the divorce what i say this is a bit confusing but i'll try to answer it to the best of my ability allah azzawajal says in the quran b divorce takes place twice with the option of retaining the wife and living with her meaning revoking the divorce or setting her free and this depends on the reader period see see meaning to watch not see as in yes in spanish when a man marries a woman he has three divorces in his wallet that he can use so if he divorced the first divorce for any reason they are still married man and wife for the period of the iddah he can see her she can wear whatever clothes she wants they can communicate and talk but no intimacy at all this is prohibited without the intention of revoking the divorce and reconciling with her so she sits so what is the edda period a pregnant woman her edda ends when she delivers a non-pregnant woman a normal woman is three monthly cycles so i divorced her we lived for a couple of weeks she got her menses this is one she was pure she got the second menses this is two she got pure she got the third menses for seven days in this period i did not reconcile with her did not revoke the map the divorce if she gets pure from the third menses if she sees her purity it's done we are no longer man and wife i have no control over her she can get married in the evening if she wishes she's a total stranger from but if i reconcile and revoke the marriage and i revoke the divorce and i say listen i revoke the divorce you're my wife again then one down two to go if the same thing happens again he divorced her divorces her for the second time the divorce takes place the same process the idea of three monthly cycles if she is over 55 or 60 and she doesn't have menses then her day is three months lunar months so if i revoke the divorce or reconcile with her after the second divorce two down one to go if i divorce her the third and last divorce immediately she is haram for me there's no going back no reconciliation no revoking of divorce immediately she has to leave the house where's the hijab and cut all forms of communication as i am a nun mahram to her okay let's get married again no she has to get married to another man a real true genuine marriage with intercourse with no intention of getting divorced from him to come back to me a full-fledged marriage if she were to be divorced then i can get married to her again and a lot zojo knows best"
