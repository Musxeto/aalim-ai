  "title": "Imam immediately sat down after being notified of a mistake, is our prayer behind him valid?",
  "transcript": "Aarik from USA. My question is we were praying in Masjid once, the Asr prayer, and Imam made a mistake and he missed his first tajjal and he just stood up for the third raka. And he was straight standing and I was just saying Subhanallah from behind and I saw him immediately sitting down and continue his prayer and he just give to frustration of forgetfulness before salam. So my question is in this case is the prayer of Imam or Aar is valid because like he was standing straight but he just stood back. And most likely the Imam was ignorant of the ruling and ignorance does not invalidate the prayer. On the contrary it's a legitimate excuse to tolerate so many of the mistakes that happen. People may talk in their prayer as in the hadith when a man sneezed during the congregation and his companion said to him, Yajamukumullah and the companions were all outraged by this so they started looking at him during the prayer. So the guy said, Why are you looking at me like this? During the congregation. So they started padding and clapping on their thighs. When the prayer was over the Prophet called the man and told him that it is not befitting of the prayer for you to speak. And the Prophet did not say to him, Go and repeat your prayer. Why? Because he did it out of ignorance. Now if I during the prayer was doing my prayer and said, Oh, more than turn down the AC, it's too cold. The Sin Veritas is my prayer on the spot. I'm not ignorant. I know the ruling. So your Imam most likely was confused. Maybe he knew the ruling but he did not think of it. So he out of his reflex made him sit immediately when you said subhanAllah or he was absent minded. Whatever. Therefore the prayer is valid inshaAllah. Unless he says, Yes, I knew the ruling but I thought that I have to sit for your sake. For example, then his prayer would be invalid.\n36\n00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:36,600\nYour prayers would be valid because you did not know of his intention and Allah as Oj knows best."
