  "transcript": "from the us uh is it obliged upon me to obey my parents when they asked me to do things that are of no benefit to them but also don't harm me such as cutting my hair well this is something that one should look at the benefits and what brings happiness to your parents hearts if your hair is untidy or if your hair is too long or it doesn't look presentable or they your parents think that it is not good and they ask you to cut your hair and there is no harm on you it's not going to kill you it's not going to look really bad on you and you feel that if you do this allah would be pleased with you you should do that is it obligatory is it mandatory i would beg to differ because this is a personal thing but when to draw the line and say that no this is a personal thing i can stand in front of my parents say no i'm not going to cut my hair and when would we consider this to be an act of disobedience and being undutiful or disrespectful to your parents so one as long as he's living with his parents as long as he they are not asking him to do something that is outrageous sometimes girls come and say uh dad we would like to dye our hair like purple pink and green and the father says no i don't approve of that and this is it haram said whether it's haram or not i don't approve of something that makes you look like a freak so they say okay as long as it's not how am i gonna do it is this the attitude that a woman or a boy should have with his father who's been spending on him all of his life who has rights over him of course not so one has to be really balanced in knowing what to obey and what not to obey you"
