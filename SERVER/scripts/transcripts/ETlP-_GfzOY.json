  "transcript": "Madhahar from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Yeah, my question is regarding the Islamic apps on mobile phones. So if you are at home, it is fine, you keep your mobile phone outside and when you are at office, you carry your mobile phone in your pocket to the washroom or maybe any other area. Is that permissible? If I have, and I do have, a copy of the Qur'an in my mobile phone, however, when I reach out to my mobile phone and I enter the masjid, or I enter the toilet, or I enter the office, can you see the Qur'an? The answer is no. Which means that there is no Qur'an. What is haram is when I'm in the toilet and I open a page of the Qur'an, now the Qur'an is visible. Now the verses are visible, this is haram. While it's in the memory, it's not the actual physical Qur'an, it is XO. I think it's XO or XI, I don't know, IO maybe, or one zeroes or whatever, how they work these logarithms and the stuff. So there is no problem in taking your mobile and apps into the toilet as long as you don't open them."
