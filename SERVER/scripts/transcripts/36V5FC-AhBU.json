  "title": "Will dajjal be in hell or heaven or is he sent just to test humanity?",
  "transcript": "before we take your live questions so the first one is from King he says will de Jal also be in Hell or Heaven or he's just sent to test Humanity is a disbeliever and what more Blasphemous than to claim that he is our Lord what more Blasphemous than to claim to know the Unseen and to give life to the dead so he's claiming lordship so he is definitely a cafe and being killed by the prophet and messenger of Allah Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is also a sign that he is in hell for eternity"
