  "title": "Is Reading Quran after prayer Bid'ah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Izan from Australia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu My question is how can we differentiate between everyday actions, like for example someone who reads Quran every day after Fajr and between bid'ah, so innovation in the religion? We are ordered to recite the Quran 24 hours, 7 days a week. So if a person recites it after Fajr prayer, or after Dhuhr, or after Asr, or after Maghreb and Isha, thinking that by doing this he will get more reward than any other time, this becomes a bid'ah. But if he's doing it because this is the time of convenience, after prayer he has like 15, 20 minutes and he would like to utilize the time by reading a certain number of pages after Fajr prayer, there is no problem in that insha'Allah."
