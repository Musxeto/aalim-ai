  "transcript": "Jazak Allah Khair. First of all, Hidayah, guidance, is in the hand of Allah Azza Wa Jal. How many years did the Prophet ﷺ live with his uncle Abu Talib? Almost 50 years. Could he make him accept Islam? No. Even on his deathbed, Ya Ammah, say the word La Ilaha Illa Allah, that I can intercede with Allah on the Day of Judgment. He was almost going to say it. Abu Jahl next to him said, you want to say something different than what your father Abdul Muttalib used to say? So at the end, he said, he will die on the religion of Abdul Muttalib and he died. The Prophet was depressed, was sad. He loved his uncle and he couldn't save him. Allah Azza Wa Jal revealed the Qur'an, It's not for you to guide them, but it is Allah who guides whomever He wills. This means that we have to do what we have to do, but we cannot ensure or guarantee the results. And Allah never asks us for results. Allah asks us for the way. Do what you want according to what Allah wants, but the results are in Allah's hands. I did my business. And many people make mistakes about the results. So they say, okay, how much or how many followers followers Sheikh so-and-so has? Oh, he has 5 million. MashaAllah, he's good. How much Sheikh so-and-so has? Well, he has 150,000. He's not, he's nothing. Sheikh Bin Baz, may Allah be pleased, may Allah have mercy on him. One of the greatest scholars of Islam. Those who attended his classes in the masjid were handful. While when Sheikh Al-Albani came to Medina, the masjid was full. So some of his students came to him and said, Sheikh, why is it that very little people come to attend your class with your huge knowledge and you're the Grand Mufti of Saudi? Grand Mufti of Saudi? Well, they go somewhere else and they attend to people lesser than you. If the Sheikh's heart was corrupt, what would he say? Oh, these people have ignorance. They don't know. They don't have knowledge. He said, this is Allah's favor. He bestows upon whomever he wishes. He never stopped giving lectures, even if they were 5 or 10. Some people make a condition. How many people are attending? If you say 10,000, he said, okay, yes, let's make a lecture. If you say 50, he said, no, too little. The Prophet said on the day of judgment, I saw the messenger with huge followers. And I saw a messenger with less followers. And I saw a messenger with thousands of followers. And I saw a messenger with a handful of followers. And I saw a messenger with one or two only following him. And I saw a messenger with no one following him. So now you tell me this messenger, he failed? No messenger fails in his mission. But Allah did not guide the people to follow him. The messenger was doing his level best. He succeeded. He gained the highest rank with Allah. He's a messenger. So you don't guarantee the results. Do what Allah tells you to do. How? Raise your children according to Islam, according to Quran. Make them love Islam, not be forced for it. Because sometimes they will hate Islam if you force them. No, make them love it. Give them incentives, ice cream, maybe some picnic. Promise them if you finish this surah, I will take you to play or something. And make them love Islam. At the end of the day, if they grow to become good Muslims, you have done your job. If they grow to be bad Muslims, you have done your job. Allah will not hold you accountable. What happens Sheikh if I die before I manage to do this? Who made you die? So Allah will take care of them. Don't worry. Allah is Al-Razzaq. But you have to worry about now, when you're alive, what did you do? And inshallah, things will be fine. Trust Allah and depend on him and have full reliance on him and everything will be smooth."
