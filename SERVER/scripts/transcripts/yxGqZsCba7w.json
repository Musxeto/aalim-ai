  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Pakistan okay my question is \nregarding shortening the prayer while we are   traveling and also combining them we all know that \nwe have the option of combining while traveling   and also we can shorten it but the dispute amongst \nthe scholars has arrived when we reach particular   days some say you can shorten your prayers \nup to 4 days some say you can do it 15 days are you talking about reaching your hometown or \nreaching your destination you're traveling to   no no I traveled from my home country to another \ncountry to another country so you're allowed to   shorten and combine your prayers even if you \nreach that town for example if you are residing   in Lahore and you're traveling to Islamabad \nyou go to Islamabad for five Six Days Seven   Days ten days you combine and shorten there \nbecause you are still labeled as a traveler   when do you pray normally when you become settled \nmeaning that you have an apartment or you have   moved in with your brother or with your cousin \nand now you're settled you're staying there   for three four months this is when you start \nto complete your prayer and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
