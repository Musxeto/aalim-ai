  "title": "Can we recite only Ayatul Qursi after the Fatiha in prayer | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Dahlia she says can we recite only ayatul kursi after fatiha in salat first of all we have to know that's a lot the prayer we pray five times a day as pillars of Islam and other prayers that we pray throughout the day and night as a voluntary or recommended or emphatic soon these are composed of pillars mandate a acts and words and composed of voluntary acts how did we reach this conclusion the answer is by the scholars sitting down looking at all the evidences about the description of the salat of the prophet alayhi salatu salam identifying that this is a pillar because the Prophet told the man who came to the Masjid three times giving Salam and the Prophet says Radhika Salam go back and pray because you did not pray and the man repeated this three times and then he said o prophet of Allah this is all what I know teach me so the Prophet taught him whatever the Prophet taught him at that hadith the scholars considered this to be a pillar so there are pillars if you forget them or deliberately ignore them your prayer is invalid you have to pray them in a salat you cannot have fetcher without Tohru core and force which would if you have fell with Freesat jute and you leave your prayer is invalid then we have the mandatory acts which if you forgot them then your prayer is valid if you deliberately leave them then your prayer is invalid such as saying Allahu Akbar to do rock or or to do sujood or to sit between the two Sajid saying Allahu Akbar in the movement saying Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah when you raised from a rock or when you say subhanAllah be a demon or subhan allah by allah in sujood these are mandatory acts then we have voluntary acts such as raising the hands when saying Allahu Akbar putting the right over the left on the chest this is voluntary if I put them down there is no problem and such as reciting the fat the surah after the fatiha what yes and bear with me lover prayer is composed of four raka we all know since childhood that we recite the fat high in the first raka and surah the fatiha and a surah in the second Raqqa the Fatiha alone in the third and the fourth raka but what is a pillar where is mandating what is voluntary scholars say that the Fatiha is a pillar in Lahore in each and every rakah no doubt in that but reciting the surah after the fact in the first and second raka is a highly recommended Sunnah which means that if you deliberately do not recite it and go to rock or immediately in the first and the second raka your prayer is valid not only that in the third and fourth raka if I recite the Fatiha and then I decided to recite another surah afterwards the salat is valid and there is no problem in that because in the hadith of abu sa'id acutally the Prophet is Salam prolonged the third and fourth rocket to be half the time spent in the first and second raka of the whole prayer so I hope any this answers the question again to recite only ayatul kursi after the fatiha is totally legit and impermissible you recite less than that no problem you said more than that there is no problem"
