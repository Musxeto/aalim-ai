  "transcript": "Saeed from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh Asim, I'm calling from New York. We all see your question and answer, so I have a question today. I have a Hafizia madrasa in Bangladesh, so this is a private ownership, so my donation to this madrasa will be considered as a sadaqah jariah. This is your question? Yes. The answer is 100%. Saeed, whatever is charitable and it's continuous, this is sadaqah jariah. Even when you die, those who memorized the Qur'an in this madrasa, those who learned how to pray and to practice Islam, and moved on with their lives, and they teach others, and they have children and they teach them, while you are in your grave, your good deeds are being generated because of all of these. So feel comfortable and content, because this is 100% sadaqah jariah bi-idhnillah."
