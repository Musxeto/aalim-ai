  "transcript": "is if the lyrics of a song contain something shirk and I heard the song and the song is playing in my mind without any sound from my mouth, am I committing shirk? No, you ask one question Thurayib. This is a frequently asked question which is we watch movies that contain shirk or kufr. We may listen to songs that the lyrics contain shirk or kufr. So by doing so are we committing shirk or kufr? The answer is what you're doing is a major sin and definitely something that is dangerous. But shirk and kufr usually is related to conviction and belief. So if you don't share such beliefs and conviction and you don't believe in it and you resent it and you hate such kufr and shirk, this is not an act of kufr or shirk but by all means you are sinful for that."
