  "transcript": "Now about donation, I accidentally donated £250 to Islamic Relief and I have an issue because I want to cancel it but at the same time since it's Ramadan I shouldn't cancel the payment even though my intention wasn't to pay £250 and it was my mistake. What should I do? What should I do? Will I get reward for not cancelling the money even though it was a mistake? If you did not cancel it, it means that you are approving it and you will be rewarded for that. If you cancelled it, this is your right. Nobody says that you have to go ahead with that mistake which you did not intend and you will be sinful if you retract it. No, there's nothing wrong in going back in it and putting that I wanted only to donate £25, not £250. There's no problem with that."
