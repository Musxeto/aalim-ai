  "transcript": "[Music] but it was not at the time of prophet and bukhari muslim and i am a fourth school of thought did not use it for shahad of this statement so there are two separate verses mentioned separately and muhammad mental security it is not in sequence order and the prophet and the companion they never ever say this statement so if this is not concoction and publication my friend this is something that we've tackled number of times and elsewhere and this is been circulating by people of ignorance and they are making it an issue where it's something that's so trivial and so dot dot dot that it's a waste of time when people say is this a shahada or not when people say muhammadun rasulullah is this a statement yes or no yes when you hear the name of rasulullah wouldn't you say allah muhammad nobody says that when you want to embrace islam yes you do and the hadith backs it up saying muhammad so making an issue and trying to raise this whenever possibility when a scholar or student of knowledge or a lecturer said oh raising the flag people say muhammad rasool allah this is wrong it's not in bukhari it's not in muslim so who said it was in bukhari or muslim so what what is it oh it's an innovation no it's not innovation it's kufur you cause you're saying and people escalate things like this without any justification or logical uh interpretation to it so again and again those people who abide and hold on to this allegation are exactly as intellectual as those who insist that the earth is flat or insist that this uh thing is true and this thing is wrong without any reason or justification to fight over it or to make it an issue so to these brothers i say have a life try to get a life you don't have one and move on don't look into these nonsense and allah knows best you"
