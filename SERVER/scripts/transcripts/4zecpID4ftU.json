  "transcript": "so brother Shuaib had a question about decree the divine decree of Allah al Qaeda and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam prohibited us to debate or argue about Al Queda Imam Ahmed says Al Queda is the knowledge of allah azza wajal which means that we cannot go deep into it nevertheless it is one of the six pillars of Eman that you believe in Allah divine decree and to believe in destiny which Allah has written fifty thousand years before he created the creation as in the authentic hadith so our brothers tribes confusion are there two types of Qatar well actually the Qatar is one and this is what allah azza wajal has decreed when he first created the pen he told the pen right so the pen said what should i write a lot old the pen to write the decree of everything until the day of judgment the prophet tells us how some this was done fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation so everything had been written and done over with yet we do not know this so we act and we're hopeful there are or there is another type of decree which allah azza wajal decrease every year and allah azzawajal reveals some of it to the angels and the angels know that this individual will live or will die this year his provision is so-and-so yet this type of decree may be erased and changed without any contradiction with what is in the preserved tablet which was written fifty thousand years before the creation that is fixed and unchanged but what the angels get and they get to know this change according to what is in the preserved tablet so it is decreed that I die after one month and this is what the Angels know but due to the fact that I have called my aunt I have visited my uncle I have given something to a cousin of mine I connected to my next of kin Allah Azza WA JAL orders the Angels to prolong my life span for another two years for example so they erase it and write it this is exactly in accordance to what it is in the preserved tablet but the Angels did not know so it changes so in a sense the main destiny does not change the annual destiny changes according to what is in the preserved tablet coming back to tribes question the hadith of Abdullah who must Road may Allah be pleased with him that a person may act for 60 years as if he is part of the people of Jannah in another narration it says FEMA I ever do Lena's to what appears to the people so for 60 years this individual has been praying has been fasting has been given charity has been reciting the Quran has been looking pious and practicing to those who look at him yet only Allah knows what's in his heart so after 60 years Hamas is almost there in Jannah yet he does something that ruins his entire legacy and past he falls into a sin that Allah concludes his life with the sin and then he is bound to hellfire and the opposite is true someone who is reckless he's not practicing he does not do anything related to Islam that is good and it's sinful sixty years and all of a sudden just before he dies Allah guides is hard to do something good to repent to feel remorseful and he dies he goes straight to paradise there is no injustice in it I seek refuge in allah azza wajal from attributing such a thing to him allah is fair and just however Allah judges our hearts those who act in a way that we see it in front of us may act differently to what is in their hearts and this is what Allah judge judges them with what's in their heart that's why hypocrites come to the Prophet Allah some say we believe that you are the Messenger of Allah and Allah knows that you are the Messenger of Allah but Allah knows and testifies that they are lying so there is no contradiction insha Allah you have to believe that Allah is knowledgeable he knows what was in the past what is in the present what's in the future and what did not happen how it would have been if it were to happen Allah is knowledge is unlike anything we could think of and you have to believe in Allah fairness and justice and allah azzawajal does not treat anyone unfairly or unjustly and thirdly you have to believe that Allah owns the whole universe that we see and that we do not see so whatever he does to us or to any of his creation he is acting in what he owns no one can say or question him why are you doing this so if you believe in these three great attributes of allah azza wajal you your heart will feel safe and calm insha Allah and you will surrender to Allah faith"
