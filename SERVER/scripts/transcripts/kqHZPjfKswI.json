  "title": "Shave Beard for job? Remove Hijab for job? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] amal says in my workplace they ask you to shave your beard is it permissible to do so to get a job as you know jobs are very difficult to find these days amal first of all you have to understand a number of things number one who's the provider who's the one who provides you nourishes you gives you all what you depend on who's the one who's providing us with air with water with food who's the one who's giving us the energy to be able to commute from one place to the other to walk to talk to learn and to teach it's allah azza this is one of the most easiest facts to understand and believe yet it is one of the most difficult to implement muslims are having difficulties you find muslims selling liquor dealing in riba interest selling tobacco dealing with haram media sources such as movies music etc and when you tell them about it they say we have to make a living subhanallah so you're requesting you're seeking your risk your provision from halal sources then you're not seeking it from allah azzawajal because a crook a thief a burglar would say the same why why why are you breaking into people's homes so that i have to make a living a prostitute would say the same what why are you doing this she says i have to make a living and all of this is not an excuse because allah is a provider and he provides for you halal you have to look for it second thing you have to put in the back of your mind that your religion comes on top of your priority list so they tell you shave your beard if you want to get a job tell them no i want jenna i want paradise and what you're asking me to do is prohibit it and i have no justification for it so i will refrain if someone tells you in order to get a job if you're a female you have to take your hijab off you have to wear a skirt you have to wear a shirt or a t-shirt and expose your hair and she says what can i do i need to work as a nurse i need to work as a bartender i need to do this or all of this is haram so your religion comes on top but our biggest problem is we don't have true trust dependence and reliance on allah azza we depend on our intellect on our degrees on our strength on the people we know the connections we have and rarely we depend on allah by supplicating making dua invoking him at times where he answers your prayers most likely such as at the last third of the night between adhama when you're prostrating when the rainfall is falling at the last hour of a friday etc so many things so many ways to get allah azzawajal to respond to you and to answer you and he wants you to make dua to him but we are negligent and may allah grant us all from means we do not [Music] anticipate you"
