  "transcript": "uh a bit a bit of a f question inshallah uh as we all know uh going to Haj from Canada from the West is extremely expensive my wife and I have been saving money to both go to Hajj but if we have saved enough for one of us only to go am I supposed to go and leave her behind sounds like this brother wants to go alone who's earning they're both earning if they're both earning how are you going to take money from her and go and make Haj no of course you can't all man for himself so if they're both earning and you save and I always say this whether you like it or not do not have a joint account men and women must not have a joint account whether it they're both working or the man is working alone I have gone through counseling sessions like crazy and if you don't have a prenup you're going to regret this each individual in the marriage must have his own Financial uh um independency don't let your wife know how much you earn how much you save how much you spend and you as a wife don't let him know how much you earn how much you save and how much you spend this is your god-given right now if they both work each one of them has his own savings if she has money enough to go for Hajj and he has not uh uh collected or saved enough because she doesn't spend she doesn't pay the rent she doesn't pay the utility bills she doesn't ship in the expenses the men are saying why because you're a man if allegedly a man doesn't allow himself to take one single penny of his wife or otherwise he's not a real man he's a wimp so have a spine I think they have orthopedic surgeons here they would help you in this but if you did not save enough for your own Hajj she cannot go without a mam so she has to wait for you or here she can say listen honey uh I'll give you what's remaining so that we can both go to Hajj if you save more than her and you have enough money to go for Hajj but she doesn't run because on the day of judgment Allah will question you about you for not making Hajj not for her she's an independent person you're not obliged to give her money for Hajj if you do you're a good man you're a good Muslim and a generous Muslim but if you don't and she doesn't have her own savings or anyone to give her she's not obliged to do Haj so don't mix oranges with apples unless you're eating cocktail fruit"
