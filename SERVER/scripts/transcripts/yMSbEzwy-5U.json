  "transcript": "um is it haram to cut the beard due to jobs that require you to shave because of safety of your being and if they tell you to wear a thong would you do that of course not see the issue is that we as Muslims are ordered to obey Allah and there's no obedience to human beings in disobeying Allah so I have red lines so what is the limit and what is the job that would require me for safety to sh shave my beard or cut it short come on working in with machines you can put a face mask or put something that would restrain it from going to that machine you're an uh um Air Force pilot the face mask can fit without any problem you are a surgeon again this has nothing to do with what you're doing because you have hair in the different places so this is too much when people make an issue out of a no issue I have my religion to uh observe and to protect because if you don't draw the line sisters you're obliged to take your hijab off okay Thea is too long don't wear ABA okay the dress is too long wear pants and what is this we're not going to work as Hooters we are here to serve and work a job that pays Halal and and i' rather seek Allah's provision in halal anywhere else rather than in a place that would compromise my religious practice and Allah Knows Best"
