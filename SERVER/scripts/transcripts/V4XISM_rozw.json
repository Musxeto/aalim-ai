  "transcript": "consider subscribing from nigeria um my question today i we know that there's no disorder there's no obedience when it comes to disobedience of allah correct but in this situation now where there's a lady who she is a she's someone who has been struggling uh with cancer since she was a kid and then finally she accepted islam alhamdulillah but then her parents now because of this they did not care about her illness but they disowned her and they threw her out of the house so her relatives now happen to pick her up and they are the ones taking care of her taking care of her medical bills and everything but now it now happens that the relatives are sufi subhanallah and this sufis they engage in some bad ah which involves also worshiping of the graves so it has gotten to a situation where she is threatened now by the sufis of which because she doesn't want to participate in their acts of bitter like escorting them to go worship the graves so they are now threatening her that they would not pay for medical bills if she does not follow them to go worship the graves in this situation sheikh what can she do should she just trust and leave them or what can she do when we know that if she leaves them and there's no medical bill for her it may be detrimental to our health barricade first of all may allah would cure this woman's illness and prevent her from deteriorating and may allah azzawajal find a way out for her secondly committing kuffur when oppressed is permissible and it's a concession as mentioned in the quran and as clearly mentioned in the hadith of be pleased with him when he came to the prophet crying amar came crying saying that they kept on tormenting me and torturing me until i cursed you so the prophet said to him how do you feel your heart and ammar said filled with iman and tranquility i love you i don't i would never ever say such a thing but i was compelled so the prophet said allah as long as they keep on torturing you no problem in keep on keeping on cursing me or insulting me so this was mentioned clearly that there is no pressure on someone who's compelled to commit kufaranchir now having said this the type of forcing has to be compelling someone comes to you with a gun pointing to your head saying that if you don't divorce your wife i'm gonna blow your brains off and you know that he's gonna do it this is compelling this is forcing you to do something someone who says while clipping his nails if you don't divorce your wife i'm gonna clip your nails or i'm i'm gonna attack you with this nail clipper of course this is rubbish this is nothing so in in such cases there is no obedience to such people so she should look into her case if they're preventing her medication her treatment and she's deteriorating and she knows that if this stops for a few days she will die or be badly affected by it in this case she can obey them while resenting it with her heart and trying her level best to escape but if what they're threatening her to off would not do a lot of harm to her and she can live with a little bit of difficulty with a little bit of hardship but she will continue to live and depending on what stage of cancer she is in and she decides not to concede to their pressure then she is highly rewarded and she insha allah will be finding the fruits of that and eventually we are all dying as the man says we are merely delayed funerals all of us we're walking on earth our funeral is ready but it's being delayed for a day for a week for a month for a year for 10 years inevitably it's going to happen so she has to evaluate and see what's the best thing for her and make things easy for her you"
