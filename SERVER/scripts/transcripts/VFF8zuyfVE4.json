  "title": "How to seek Islamic Knowledge when I am prevented as I am taking care of my parents",
  "transcript": "Okay, the last question. I am 22 years old and the eldest in my family. I have a lot of responsibilities including supporting my parents financially and physically. Please can you guide me how I can learn proper Islamic knowledge with the correct Aqeedah? How old is he? 22. 22. Alhamdulillah. As long as you are supporting your parents financially, this is one of the greatest doors and gates of Jihad. Your father, your mother have suffered a lot to make you reach where you are. Payback is very sweet. Alhamdulillah Allah has blessed you to be able to do that. Islamic knowledge is not isolated or limited to Madina University or to Imam Saud University or to Ummul Qura University. People think that there is no Islamic knowledge except in Saudi. Alhamdulillah there are so many places where you can seek knowledge from. Nowadays, Alhamdulillah Allah has blessed us in ZAAD Academy which we have online to do a diploma for semesters, two years, teaching Islamic sciences both in Arabic or in English. And with the grace of Allah, it is so successful that we have hundreds of thousands of people benefiting from it. The best part is it's free. 100%. It's online. The best part is it's under the umbrella of islamqa.info. So the founder of islamqa.info and ZAAD Academy and the TV channel I always bring Ask ZAAD on is ZAAD Company. And one of the best things about ZAAD Academy is I teach there. Of course, this is to some an advantage, to some it's a disadvantage, but it depends on how you look at it. So Alhamdulillah you can. And if you study two years in ZAAD Academy, this I guarantee you, you will be having the preliminary foundation to be a student of knowledge. You from there can move on, expand on your own with different schools and different shuyukh because you have the right correct foundation. Our problem is our knowledge is based on TikTok, clips from here and there, YouTube, random shaykhs, and we are confused. Subhanallah for five years, I thought that the adhan in the ear of the newborn is sunnah because I've heard it from X, Y, Z. Now Shaykh Asim told me it's not. So many things are clashing because you don't have the right foundation. Shaykh Asim, what do you think of Shaykh so-and-so? I don't speak ill about shuyukh. I don't sit around and say this guy is 80%. This shaykh, no, no, no, he's 40%. Discredit him. This is not the right methodology."
