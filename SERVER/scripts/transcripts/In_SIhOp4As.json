  "transcript": "our first caller is [Questioner] from \nBangladesh the Hadith says that run   away as you would run away from a lion do \nlike do we have to take this apparently   for I mean if I see someone who have \na disease like contagious disease do I   have to like run in the opposite direction \nas if I have seen a lion like uh literally this Hadith is as the prophet said run away from \nthe lepered the one who's affected by leprosy   as you run from a lion when you meet \none and the Hadith is a recommendation   to take the means as there are other \nnarrations where the Prophet (Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) ate   with a diseased person with such an illness and \nthis shows that if a person's trust in Allah   reaches the peak that there is no problem \nin mixing with such people with contagious   illnesses however the recommendation is \nthat you stay away because taking the means   is better than claiming to have full trust in \nAllah and then after being affected afflicted   by it you start to doubt your trust in Allah and \nmay blame this to that so it is not mandatory   but it is highly recommended to stay away \nfrom such contagious illnesses and diseases   by avoiding it because this is part of \ntaking the means and Allah Knows Best thank you"
