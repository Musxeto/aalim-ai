  "title": "Not Fair! People who live in Mecca & Madina get more reward so how can we get SAME reward?",
  "transcript": "We have Areej from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Sheikh, we know that the reward for praying in Masjid-e-Nabawi are considered better than performing one thousand prayers. And praying in Masjid-e-Haram is a hundred thousand times better than in any other Masjid. I'm curious about the way this reward system applies to individuals living near these sacred places, who have the opportunity to pray there regularly compared to those living farther away or in different countries. So I wanted to know how can Muslims living in different countries or farther away maximize their reward for prayers? JazakAllah Khair. Well, the only way they can do that is to shift to Mecca and Medina. Very simple. This is a reward set by Allah Azza Wa Jal as an incentive for those who live in such a beautiful city as Mecca or Medina. And those who live elsewhere are definitely deprived from such a reward. This is Allah's favor and blessing upon people. I don't have the luxury of saying how can I enjoy the beautiful weather of this country or that in Europe during springtime, when it's boiling hot where I live. This is Allah's favor and blessing upon people. He awards those whom He wills with what He wants. Living in Mecca and Medina is not easy. There's a lot of hardship involved, especially for those who may run businesses and they have to travel all the time and they need to be in a sort of a hub to be able to go all over the world for their meetings and the likes. So they may find it difficult. There are no quote-unquote international schools like those in Jeddah or in Riyadh or elsewhere. There are so many things that these cities may lack other than spirituality. So you want to compromise all of this because you want a hundred thousand prayers per prayer or a thousand prayer per prayer? Shift and move if you can. If you can't, then this is Allah's favors and blessing upon the people. It's like saying, okay, millionaires and billionaires who give in charity and zakat, how can we reach their level in the money they give in charity which we cannot afford? This is Allah's favors and blessing and Allah knows best."
