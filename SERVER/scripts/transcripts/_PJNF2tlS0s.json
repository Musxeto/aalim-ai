  "transcript": "Sayyid from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Sheikh I have problems in lowering the gaze and I'm not talking about like if I'm in the street and I'll have to completely lower my gaze and hit the pole. I'm not talking about these things. Like I'm talking like when I have to speak to a non-Mahrab. What happens is like if I'm completely lowering my gaze, I don't know why they do not understand what I say. Maybe, maybe possibly they think that I'm not speaking to her. Like so what should I do? Please help me and I failed to lower my gaze. Maybe I did not see her yet. Maybe I would lift somewhat my head and speak to her. First of all, first of all, this is your subconscience convincing you that they're not understanding or due to your shyness and due to looking down you say, Can I have a cup of latte, please? She says what? She says can I have a cup of latte? You want a cup of latte, but you're not speaking, Akhi. Articulate what you say. Can I have a cup of latte? No problem. I was looking down. Beside you don't have to look down because when you look down and talk everybody's going to look at your shoes. And what is he looking at? Look elsewhere, Akhi. Look at the desk. Look at the papers. Look at the posters. As-salamu alaykum. Yeah, can I have a cup of latte, please? Yes, please. And while you're talking you look around and you don't look at but shaitan doesn't want this to happen. So he makes you not talk properly and he convinces you that people are not understanding what you're saying and mumbling. And this is what would soften your heart a little bit too. Okay for necessity. I have to look and I have to be charming and I have to crack a joke or two. I have to smile and I have to look them straight in the eye and maybe check them out from bottom to top. Just to be courteous. Okay, then what? My place or yours? This is shaitan. This is shaitan dragging your feet step by step. Don't obey him. If they don't understand you, no problem. Go to somewhere else. But you want to bend the rules a little bit or break them? This cannot be applied and abide by Sharia and you inshallah will be in good hands and Allah Azawajal knows best."
