  "title": "If I do a sin, KNOWING that itâ€™s a sin, will Allah not accept my repentance ? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Al-Hajji from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is about Surah An-Nisa verse 17 The translation reads as Allah's acceptance of repentance is only for those who commit evil out of ignorance and then soon repent afterwards. It is towards such persons that Allah turns in mercy. Allah is all-knowing and all-wise. Does this mean that if I were to commit sin, like knowing that what I'm doing is a sin, my repentance will not be accepted when I do repent? If you go to the Tafseer Akhi, you will find that the vast majority of scholars who interpreted this ayah in Surah An-Nisa are referring to that no one falls into sin without being an ignorant. So the word jahalah does not mean knowing the ruling it's halal or haram. Because if you did not know that it is haram, there's no doubt and it's a no-brainer that Allah would not hold you accountable. If I drink this green tea with my left hand, never ever have I known that this is haram to drink with my left hand. Allah will never hold me accountable and I would never be counted as sinful. However, the verse you're referring to, that those who commit sin due to their ignorance in who Allah is, not that it is halal or haram, they know it's haram. So this is what is meant and Allah Azzawajal knows best. For more information visit www.fema.org"
