  "title": "Should I break or continue Sunnah fast if offered food? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. First of all, Sheikh, I love you so much. I hope your life is getting better all the time. I want to ask you about when we are on an event or a family gathering, and then our family and friends insist us to eat together, but we are having a fast. Do we have to break our fast during the moment? Or do we have to refuse and continue our fast? Thank you, Sheikh. Barakallahu feekum. The question is clear. If we are fasting and someone invites us to eat, should we break our fasting or continue and hide? The Prophet said, alayhis salatu wassalam, in an authentic hadith, when someone invites you while you are fasting, if you're not fasting, accept the invitation and go. And if you're fasting, go, but make dua. Continue to fast and say, sorry, I am fasting, but I will make dua. May Allah azza wa jal bless your food. May Allah bless your gathering. And sit without any problem, inshallah. So I hope this answers your question. Thank you. If it is sunnah, yes, yes, even if it's sunnah, of course, if it's fard, why is Hinti fasting? If it's Ramadan, why is Hinti inviting? No, of course, it is sunnah. Crazy invitation during Ramadan."
