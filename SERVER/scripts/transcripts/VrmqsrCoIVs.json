  "title": "Is Guaranteed Rent for 5 Years on a purchased property permissible? Rent increases every year.",
  "transcript": "anti-hub from the uk yes uh i have a question i'm planning to purchase a property in a student accommodation in the uk so what they do basically they offer guarantee rent uh for five years so is this allowed or no but the year the rent every year increases year by year um is this allowed or not is it halal for me because it's a guarantee or is it not so you're telling me that you're paying a hundred and fifty thousand pounds to this property owner and the property owner guarantees that he will pay you every year let's say six thousand pounds rent for five years is my understanding correct in the hub are you with us yes yes sir did you get my question did you get my question yes yes i did yeah is is what i said correct you are right but it's every year it's a guarantee rent a specific amount but every year with the profit uh like the price increases the guarantee also increases so is this allowed or not so who is paying for the rent they or someone else of course they are paying for the rent i see the way i see it if they say to you we guarantee paying you the rent that fluctuates this is not permissible you know what it is because of demand in the area because of the demand in the area that's why they're so that's that's what they what because of demand in the area that's why they're so confident that this would go on the rents on the first day they already have a contract with a letting agent beforehand so the project your line is breaking it seems to me that such a condition is not valid you can go ahead and buy the property but if they defaulted on fulfilling what they promised you cannot demand this because this is not related to the trend transaction if they were renting it meaning i'll sell you my ipad for two thousand dollars and i will also rent it from you the first couple of years for a hundred dollars a month so this is something that i'm pledging it seems to me that this is permissible because there is no loan in it and there is no ambiguity but if they sell you the property and they guarantee something that they don't actually own so for example first year nobody came and borrowed a rented the apartment for one reason or the other they just didn't rent they'll pay it from their own pocket now this is not fair and there is uh um a huge amount of ambiguity the buying of the property is fine for you to compel them to fulfill the condition is not permissible and allah knows best you"
