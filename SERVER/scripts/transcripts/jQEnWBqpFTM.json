  "transcript": "as says how to know when exactly is time for breaking fast because we live in western country we use Islamic finder application is it accurate to follow first of all sunset you have no problem with that Muslims and non-muslims usually give the time of sunset correctly because the Sun sets it end of story the difference is in the break of dawn the calculations whether it is 18 degrees or the other one so the best for you think for you to do when it comes to sunset and it comes to fetcher is to follow umm al-qura calendar so even in Islamic finder if you go to the settings and you choose whether it's North America or this or that for Federer and sunset for MRIB choose on map hora and you can implement that and work on that without any problem um well Porter's problem is with Asia this is inaccurate worldwide because they always fix it as at one hour and 30 minutes from sunset and this is totally wrong totally bogus and not only that in Ramadan they all of us overnight they increase it to two hours and this is wrong because those who trust it would think that oh I have two hours to pray Maghrib and this is wrong sometimes Maghrib between mallory Benicia can be an hour few minutes more a few minutes less so you are making people deceived when you say that's always an hour and a half or it's always two hours fixed and a large module knows best"
