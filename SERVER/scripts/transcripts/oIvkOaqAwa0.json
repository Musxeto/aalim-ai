  "transcript": "Abdushakur from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh, what's the ruling on working as an Amazon delivery driver or Amazon packager where they sometimes they have the products they have like Christmas packages, what's the ruling on that? If I understand your question correctly, the company sells and delivers a lot of halal products and some of the products are not halal. Being a delivery person, you don't get to know what's inside the package. There's no way for you to know that most likely. Therefore, it is permissible for you to deliver such packages inshallah without any problem."
