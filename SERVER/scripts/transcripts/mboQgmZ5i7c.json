  "transcript": "abdul ahad says from pakistan he says that i am one of those who memorize the quran by heart with the grace of allah azzawajal alhamdulillah and this is a blessing of allah to be able to memorize the quran but the quran is escaping if you miss a day or two without revising it you tend to forget so you have to revise it one of the ways of revising it is playing the surah you want to revise and revising it with this with the qari this way you master how you pronounce the ayahs and the letters and you also strengthen your memorization but this is time consuming especially if the qari is taking his time reading the quran so there is a feature in youtube or in other audio files etc some mobiles where you can double the speed triple the speed so instead of alhamdulillah there is a little bit i mean the ayah is clear to the no those who understand it there's no mocking of the quran because i am revising so there is the of tilawah the normal one there is al hader where you recite a little bit faster there's no problem in that none whatsoever and the most important point for you and for our brother fizan is how do i know i was i'm not mocking when you listen to the quran double speed are you mocking the quran is this your intention so i get questions of people saying i sit on the bed and my brother is sitting on the floor and he's a half of the quran have i become a kafir what why would you become a kafir because he memorizes higher than him or he is reciting the quran i'm sitting higher than him did you intend to humiliate the quran then why would you get such thoughts it's all from shaytaan you"
