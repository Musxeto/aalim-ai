  "transcript": "the next question is that if my father earns his money from fortune telling is his money halal for me yes it is it is haram for him he is making a major sin and he is getting out of the fold of islam because fortune telling is an act of apostasy of kuffar uh uh the prophet said allah whoever goes to a fortune teller and he believes him he has left the fold of islam so yes your father is a kafir for doing what he's doing after the conditions are fulfilled and the money he earns is halal for everybody except him"
