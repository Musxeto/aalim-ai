  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Sheikh I have a question so if I repent from doing something bad and while repenting I do get remorse but like that after a couple of minutes there is a period of like maybe if there's a period of like 10 seconds where I feel like I don't have remorse not that I like want to do it again but I don't have the burning feeling in my heart and if I but after that the remorse comes back like there are periods where the remorse goes away would my repentance be valid? Yes your repentance is valid and such a short gap of feeling no remorse has no impact on the validity of your repentance it's just shaitan messing up with your head. Ignore it and keep on asking Allah for forgiveness and Allah will forgive you."
