  "title": "Should I try to seek treatment for my mom's mental illnesses if I am an illegitimate child? assim al",
  "transcript": "Khadija from Morocco Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu So as an illegitimate child, my mother made it clear that she doesn't want me as a child or now that I am 16 years old and she has these mental illnesses, I don't want to say crazy, but just mental illnesses so my question is once I'm big enough and want to take care of her and once I can provide for her should I provide for her and live with her only or should I take her to places where she can actually cure these mental illnesses like is it permissible to cure these mental illnesses in Islam? She's your biological, Khadija, she's your biological mother? Yes Of course, you're obliged till the day you die to take care of her whether she has mental illnesses, whether she's healthy, you have to take care of her till the day she dies and you do your level best to seek medical and psychiatric help for her anywhere you can within your ability, within your financial means because Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear Sorry, is it okay if I cannot do anything now and I have to wait until I'm older? If you can't do it now, how can you do? What can you do? A person that is six months old and cannot walk, should we ask him to participate in the marathon? He said, give me time until I stand on my own feet So, yes, as long as you're unable financially or physically or you have anything that prevents you from doing that of course, you can wait until you're capable"
