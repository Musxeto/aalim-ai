  "transcript": "Abdullah from the U.S. Hello Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. I have a question. So my name is Abdullah and I receive a lot of mail or packages with my name on it in English as well as Arabic sometimes. Since it has the name of Allah in it or anyone with the name of Allah such as Abdur Rahman, would it be haram to throw those papers out if yes? As long as it's written as long as it's written in English, Akhi, there's no problem in that insha'Allahu Azza Wa Jal."
