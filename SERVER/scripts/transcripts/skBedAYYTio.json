  "transcript": "Sad from [Music] Bangladesh. Just to clarify, my name is Sadman, but you said Sad and I was able to mute unmute myself. So, should I ask the question? Your name is what? Sad man. Sad man. Okay, no problem. Okay. So she think that I loved a card and wanted it so I would make dua to Allah and I was also indulged in a sin. So while repenting from that particular sin I was indulged in I used to say while repenting that oh Allah I promise so that I will never do it and again uh and I will never do it again and if I do it ever again then don't give me that car I wanted and I would again fall into that scene again. So uh am I I'm doubtful that how many expressions should I give if you made a an oath or a vow to allahel not to fall again into a sin and you fell into it over and over again then you have to give one experation for that same sin and Allah knows"
