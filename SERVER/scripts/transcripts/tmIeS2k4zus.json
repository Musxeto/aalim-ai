  "transcript": "Abu Rayyan from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I have a question. I'll be traveling to Europe for like three months and I'll be having my own apartment and everything and I was wondering do I have to shorten my prayers at all or do I just keep praying everything normal? Okay, the moment you settle down Abu Rayyan in Europe and you have your own apartment, you know when to come and when to go this is when you pray complete and you pray on time. But if you're hopping from one city to the other or from one hotel to the other and you're not settled down you may continue to combine and shorten until you settle. So three months is a lot of time. The moment you have your own apartment and you know when your lunch is, your dinner and you know when your sleeping hours are fixed, this is when you're settled and you should pray normally."
