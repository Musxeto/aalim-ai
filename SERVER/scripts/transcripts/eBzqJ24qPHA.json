  "transcript": "yes I'm sorry I'm not musper but I'm Ryan uh I was not able to talk but now I am can I ask my question or not sure go ahead okay thank you very much my question was that in Islam it is definitely not permissible to to break uh ties of kinship but uh what about when one of the parents which is very forbidden to do to break the types of kinship with them was very abusive and not abusive uh as in he took medicine or he was in a bad place but my dad he took advantage of my mom to come from another country to Europe and when he married her he became very abusive he hit my mom hit me and then he divorced and then we never talked again so my question is when I was a kid I was very afraid of him so I always said no I don't want to see him I don't want to see him I don't want to see him and now now that I'm older I still do not want to sing but I'm afraid of the punishment of Allah for me breaking the sky at this this kinship so my question is is it permissible to break the ties of kinship with in this case my dad if he was really really really abusive and I've seen it and I know that if I talk to him again maybe I will get traumatized again and Jessica these psychological backlashes that so many of the Muslims nowadays are picking up and convincing themselves that oh to avoid the trauma to avoid any uh such feelings it's Halal for me to do one two three four no it's not we have Islam to follow we have a religion to comply with so Allah tells you that your father is the Middle Gate of Jannah you won't be able to enter Jannah without being dutiful to your father being obedient being respectful regardless of his past whatever he did to your mom you don't know what your mom did to him so she's a grown-up woman if she wanted to divorce him maybe she did that's between them if she didn't divorce him then she knows how to behave she's an adult stay out of it now if he abused you if he used to hit you if he used to verbally insult you you must tolerate this and I know that the people in the west say Lord we have human rights baloney big baloney why because they themselves they don't use the same measuring tool so when it comes to children abandoning their parents and boycotting them and misbehaving with them yet this is your right you are a human being you can do this what about if their government if their governor their president their rulers do this to them the police force does even worse things so though you have the legal system going and can complain and they know that they can't win the media shoves thoughts and ideas and rubbish and filth down their throats they can't do anything about it so you have to tolerate lies after lies they put in their lives you can't say anything about it but when it comes to your father or your mom yeah you can call 911 and put them in jail Islam is not like this the reason is that Islam is from Allah who created us and knows us and knows how we will function and behave while these man-made laws are made by humans 100 years ago homosexuality was prohibited in a crime punished by death now you talk against it we'll put you in jail and probably 20 years time if you don't become gay or homosexual we'll put you in jail what kind of nonsense is this so you have no choice he's your father be diplomatic be dutiful be respectful try to win his pleasure and forget about the past this is what Allah wants you to do and this is what will take you to Jannah any other choice would probably distance you from Jannah and I'm talking about things that we can tolerate if he's still physically abusive you may keep your distance but you have to check up upon him if he needs financial help do your level best to please Allah which comes through pleasing your father-in-law knows best this"
