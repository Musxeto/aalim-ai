  "transcript": "does your wife break your does my wife break my woodo listen to me uh the concept of touching the opposite gender is only found in the shaab where Imam sha used to say that touching the opposite gender whether your sister your Maham your wife breaks your woodoo the other Scholars and schools of thought say does not break your wo because Prophet Muhammad used to sit in his home before going to Salat he used to kiss his wife AA and go without renewing his woodo so this means that touching your wife kissing your wife does not impact the wo inshallah and Allah knows rest"
