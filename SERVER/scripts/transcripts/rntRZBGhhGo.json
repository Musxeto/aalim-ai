  "title": "Is the one who dies in a car accident a martyr (shaheed)? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "is dying in a car accident considered as martyrdom will that person be a martyr we know that martyrs are those who die in the cause of allah on the battlefield and this is something that we have to understand so if a person was injured on the battlefield taken to hospital lived for a month being treated from his wounds then died we do not treat him as a martyr in the sense that we bury him in his clothes and we don't offer a funeral prayer because he's a martyr no we wash him shroud him offer prayer and bury him and hope that he will get the reward of a martyr but martyrs are those who die on the battlefield or in the battlefield i don't know so are there other types of martyrs yes the prophet told us islam that there are seven other than those who die in the cause of allah among them are those who die in fire or under a collapsed building or due to drowning or due to stomach ache or due to certain type of illness such as the plague or while giving birth etc so these are rewarded as martyrs but not treated as such after the death being that we wash them we shroud them we offer funeral prayer and we bury them so a person who dies in a car accident is he classified as a martyr some scholars say they are because in a car crash it's like a building collapsing on you and squeezing you to death or injuring you because of the impact and this is the opinion of shaykh abdullah may allah have mercy on his soul and it is closer to logic rather than anything else that yes it's the same type of death like we when we say that those who die with coronavirus are they considered to be martyred the answer is insha allah they are because they die due to an illness similar to the plague or to drowning because it's difficult from them to breathe as if they're drowning and they die because of such uh illness so inshallah they are classified and treated uh on the day of judgement as marches you"
