  "title": "OCD patient exempt from praying kafir or forgiven? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Khurram from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikum Salam to Allah. Sheikh how are you? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. Sheikh I asked yesterday I asked about an acute OCD case and exemption from Salah. My question is different today but regarding the same issue. If a patient with severe chronic and acute OCD who is not totally insane but severely mentally affected after he seeks advice from the doctor who said that her OCD increases due to Salah and although she is not insane but the exempted one and she further took advice. So my question is if this patient eventually exempts himself from Salah so would this person be said to be nullifying his Islam or fits under the Ahadith that between a man and disbelief is abandoning of the prayer or is it just between the patient and Allah and there is still hope for forgiveness? This is an issue that's related to the ruling on abandoning Salat for good. If as you stated she is not mentally insane, she is sane but she has OCD or severe chronic case of mental illness but she's considered to be sane. If she stole money would they put her in prison? Of course. If she kills someone would they prosecute her and execute her? Of course she's mentally fit. Likewise if she willingly abandons Salat and does not pray at all then she's labeled as a kafir. If she stole come and pray and she said no I'm exempted from prayer no one is exempted from prayer except those who are insane. So if she insists then yes her marriage would not be valid, she's not a Muslim and she cannot be treated as a Muslim if she keeps on being defiant and insisting on not praying and Allah knows best."
