  "transcript": "Bushra says, does cleaning or changing baby's dirty nappy, washing after they use the washroom invalidate our wudu? The answer is, the most authentic opinion is, that this has no impact on a person's wudu. Now, we have to differentiate. Your wudu is a ritual state, so if you break your wudu, you are in the minor ritual state of impurity. And if you perform wudu and complete it, you become in the ritual impurity state. This is not invalidated by touching an impurity. Because once I touch an impurity, while I'm in the state of wudu, my hand is impure. All what I have to do is wash it off. That's it. But my state of ritual impurity, my state of ritual purity is not affected. Touching the private part of children is an issue of dispute because there are hadiths that state that touching the private part would invalidate the wudu. But the most authentic opinion is, that touching the private parts of infants and children in the state of impurity when cleaning them, does not impact your own wudu and Allah knows best."
