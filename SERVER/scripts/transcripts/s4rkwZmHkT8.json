  "title": "Can a woman be in seclusion with a man who has Alzheimerâ€™s? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Halima from France. Yes sir, I have a question for Salih Murtad. Because I would like to know, a grandmother that has dementia disease, like Alzheimer's disease, if I should be with a man, with his grandmother, am I still sinful to be in seclusion, or is it halal for me, sir? Alzheimer is a disease, or a weakness or deficiency that affects people at an older age. Now, it is degrees. If a person reaches the stage where he becomes unconscious, he has this form of dementia, he is unaware of the people present in his room, and those who are present, they would not recognize whether they are his wife, his daughter, his mother, or any other stranger. And he has no power, no control, no ability to choose. Such a person is regarded as insane, and not a sane person. So the rulings do not apply to him. So yes, you can serve him, you can be in seclusion with him, because he is not sane, where the rulings of halal and haram may apply to him, and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. So, come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
