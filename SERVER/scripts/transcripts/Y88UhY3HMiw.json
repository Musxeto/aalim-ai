  "title": "Misspoke or mispronounced in Dua during Sujood, then I repeated it, did I make Dua against myself?",
  "transcript": "Isa from the UK. Sheikh, I want to ask you a question, one question regarding two duas that I made. So, the first dua, I was in sujood making dua in English but I mispronounced a word. For example, I intended to say, do not make, I intended to say to Allah, do not make the shayateen and shaytan affect my life. As I was saying the dua, I said, do not, I accidentally said, do not made the shayateen and shaytan affect my life. Here I was supposed to say, do not make, but I said, do not made. When I uttered this mistake of saying made, I corrected myself by saying the correct word make, but I did not start from the beginning and I may have taken an unintentional pause of like three seconds before correcting the word. The second dua, an hour or two after the first incident, I decided to make the dua again, but this dua, I just, I didn't raise my hand, I wasn't in sujood, I just said the dua. But here I faced another problem. I made the dua to Allah saying, do not make the shayateen and shaytan, but I don't know why and I stopped it because of stress or me thinking I said it wrong. And then I repeated it to say it right. After like two to three seconds, I said the correct, and I said, do not make the shayateen and shaytan to affect my life. And in both the duas, I said, la hawla wa la ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu minaz zalimeen. So my question is, in both of these incidents, did I ever make dua against myself? Jazakallah khayr. No, akhi, you did not do any dua against yourself and there's nothing at all wrong in what you have done or repeating it, and I don't know why you're making a big fuzz of it. This is shaytan messing up with your head. What you have done was an unintentional mistake that has no impact on your dua, make and mate. These are tenses that are different, present and past. It has no problem in it. You've corrected it, rectified it. Move on. We'll move on inshaAllah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
