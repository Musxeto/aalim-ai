  "transcript": "IM from Sweden um so she I know a person this person's father is old um my friend uh this this person is my friend and he has a half sibling from this father unfortunately the siblings are not on good conditions my friend uh is in a very bad financial State uh his sibling is living in a much better standing than my friend the money that uh the father owns is from a factory that my friend helped in a major way to spend and spend a good portion of his life to get the factory whereever it is um while the other the other sibling did nothing and are getting benefit from my friend's work while he's while he's living in a bad State my friend sibling gets the money from the father because he is deceiving him because he is old my friend has been obedient to his father for decades in this matter and done as he as the father commanded and let the sibling take the money now my friend has fled the country and with his children due to how bad his state is while the other sibling is living in luxury the question the question um written Authority from the father uh from a while back that gives my friend authority to take from his sibling what he thinks he deserved did my friend use this written Authority and take what he thinks he deserves and make his father displeased or should he he and children stay in this bad State this is an issue of dispute between the siblings and their father I cannot hear it from one side and decide that okay you have a prior authorization so now you can take whatever is yours because it's not his now the the money belongs to the father and the father did not steal anything from his Elder son who's your friend rather the other son is cheating his father he's abusing his father he's fooling his father and he's taking some money this is between the father and the son the other son who fled the country cannot use this paper to steal from his own father against his will even if his father is old or in Dementia or is not in control unless he has proof that his wealth is being squandered and Wasted by his younger brother as as I said this is his word against his word and I cannot judge in this thing maybe your friend is lying maybe your friend is not telling the truth maybe the other sibling is taking it lawfully from his father due due to some reasons between them I cannot judge this and this cannot be judged by one man show meaning that your friend would just come in and do whatever he wants with this authorization which is old and should not be effective by now because the other Heirs of the father who is old and may be in dementia must approve of what is happening and Allah Knows Best"
