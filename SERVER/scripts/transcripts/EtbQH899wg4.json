  "title": "Listening to Music or Nasheed vs Qur'an - assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "allah says in the quran that there are people when quran is recited to them they don't take this well listen to this ayah and when allah is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink with aversion they have hatred to it but when those worshipped other than him the almighty are mentioned immediately they rejoice this is what a lot of the people nowadays are going through whenever they hear the quran whenever they hear the quran so many people love to listen to music to songs even to nasheed over listening to the quran and this is a very serious offense an indication of how little your iman is"
