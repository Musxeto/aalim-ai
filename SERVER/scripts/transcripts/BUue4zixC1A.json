  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Pakistan I was told that your \nname is Rahman is this true my name is [ __ ]okay   then never ever say Rahman alone because this is \nonly the name of Allah it cannot be used alone   thank you so much yes my friend my my my question \ncarries a little detail I would request to give it   a patient hearing I have many questions after you \nand the time is very limited so try to give me as   short as possible please okay I'm here to see \nguidance regarding pending zakaat issue of my   daughter who is a naive and a very simple nature \nfor the past many years ever since the time of   marriage from the year 1990 about 34 years she \ndoesn't remember for how many years she initially   paid zakat on the jewelry whether it was correctly \npaid or not but during past so many years it was   not based she missed zakaat now if she doesn't \nsell our gold for zakat payment considering that   her husband is likely to retire in due course \nand she wants to save some gold as a sense of   Financial Security in case of any difficulty in \ntimes ahead and to save some for her daughter's   marriage also due to being disheartened after \ntwo three theft incidents causing loss now the   economic situation of Pakistan is also critical \nnow if our husband is willing to pay on her behalf   but most of is money the husband's money is in \na conventional Bank in Saving accounts to which   bank adds monthly profit and if there is only one \naccount uh with which is in current in which he   receives his pension and rent of the houses which \nhe transferred to his wife's and daughter's name   but unfortunately these houses were also bought \nfrom the money in the saving account with profit   now can zakat be paid from the saving accounts \nif Bank profit is deducted and is the saving   amount itself liable to zakaat first before being \nreused as the cost payment on jewelry or shall we   pay only via the pension in installments but \nthat would take from few months up to a year the question is very clear and you do not \nhave to go into details the question can be   understood in a very easy way a woman has \ngold and she is obliged to pay the zakat   whether she has savings or not it's not my \nbusiness she is obliged to pay it the zakaat   if she doesn't have savings or money she has \nto sell a portion of it to pay for the zakat   this year or for the previous years where she's \nbelieved that it was mandatory for her to pay   the zakat but she didn't this is a debt now her \nhusband who has Halal income and Haram income   due to the interest being uh taken from the bank \nover his savings if he volunteers to pay her zakat   whether from Halal or Haram it doesn't matter \nbecause the sin of earning the money is on the   husband he gets it through selling cigarettes \ndrugs interest-based prostitution it's none of   my business he's sinful for the money he's earning \nnow once he had earned it and he gives it as a   gift to his wife to pay her zakat that's kosher \nthat's legal that's Halal the sin is still on him   she is not obliged to ask him where did you get \nthis money was it from Halal sources what it was   it from your pension was it from your interest \nbased uh account there's no need for her to   worry about this takes the money gives her zakat \nand the sin is on the husband Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All foreign"
