  "title": "Purpose of Every Single Prophet || assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I think we have Anas from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam. Was every single messenger or Prophet sent to teach the people to worship Allah alone and stay away from the false gods, like every single one of them? True. What's your question? That was the question. Yes, yes. It was mentioned that we have not sent a messenger at all except to tell the people to worship Allah, the only worthy God to be worshipped. So this is a universal fact. All prophets and messengers of Allah were sent for the sole purpose of guiding the people to worship Allah, the Almighty, and to avoid associating others with Him."
