  "transcript": "Hadith a questioner says I heard a Hadith that says seek help in having your needs met by being discreet for everyone who's blessed with something is envied does this mean we should not tell others about our upcoming events due to fear of evil eye the answer is yes in short generally speaking the everyone Among Us who's favored by Allah is being envied so if I keep on telling people listen tomorrow I'm going to buy a new car inevitably one would give me an evil eye without him or me knowing it it happens it's something natural uh if I say to people that I'm applying for a job and it has double the salary and benefits and insurance for the parents blah blah blah again there is a a possibility of people being envious so the prophet sallam is telling us to to be discreet not that it is prohibited yes I do observe myar in the morning in the evening but I am not certain about people's intention and sometimes I might be breaking someone's heart who's not as fortunate as I am so the Hadith is clearly stating that we should uh try to avoid this to the best of our ability and Allah Knows Best"
