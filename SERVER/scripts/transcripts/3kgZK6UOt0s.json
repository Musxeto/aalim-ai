  "title": "Is Bulking or Overeating for muscle building makrooh? Assim Al Hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "So, our first caller is Umar from Egypt Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh is eating in a very large calorie surplus to gain muscle, otherwise known as bulking, halal or haram? Jazakallahu Khair Wa Jazakum First of all, it is a sunnah to divide your intake of food into three parts. One third for your food, one third for your liquids and drinks, and one third for breathing. So this is moderation. However, to sometimes fill your, to eat your full and to fill your stomach, this is permissible at sometimes as per the hadith of Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was starving and then the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam gave him some milk and he started to drink and drink and drink until he said by the one who sent you with the truth, I don't have any more space for anything, I'm totally full. So this means that it is permissible to fill your stomach totally. Now the reason you're doing this is to gain muscles and bulk as in the case of bodybuilders and bodybuilding per se in the normal conditions without any protein or steroids or hormone growth is permissible. We all hit the gym, we all work out, but when it becomes as an obsession and a form of boasting and showing off your awrah and exposing it and your intent is ill, your intention is not a pure halal intention, rather it is either to impress others, this is not permissible. You're catching like a magnet an evil eye that may harm you. You're boasting with the blessing and ni'mah of Allah Azzawajal in the wrong place and time and your intention is not pure and clean. So if this is the case, this becomes haram and Allah knows best."
