  "transcript": "Suham from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Wassalamu Alaikum. So sometimes I might not concentrate in the prayer and I say I might say like Subhana Rabbi Al-Azeem without intending to do it and There's something a problem that I have. So do I have to repeat it again? When you say Subhana Rabbi Al-Azeem, are you saying it while in the Ruku' position? Yeah, no problem. I don't intend it. No, no, no. No, this is something that happens by default in Because if you open the door for Shaitaan to say to you Oh, you did Allahu Akbar, but you didn't intend it. Repeat the Salah. You'll end up repeating the Salah 50 times a day and this will drive you crazy. This will drive you off the wall. No, you've said it in the correct position whether you were tentative or not. It doesn't make any difference. Try your level best next time, but don't repeat it."
