  "transcript": "[Music] uh madiha says can i ask you a question people who go to graves of wise people of islam like the sahaba and the imams can people pray through them as my dad says you don't ask from them you ask through them is that right so basically what madi has asking about is the justification of grave worshipers when we talk to them and say what you're doing is shirk they say i am not doing shirk i'm not asking the jilani or the badawi or the tijani or the prophet islam to protect me i'm asking the prophet all these righteous people to ask allah azzawajal so we are taking them as intermediaries and this is exactly the shirk that allah mentioned in the beginning of surat as zuma allah says in those who take protectors besides him say we only worship them that they may bring us nearer to allah in position this is the claim of the mushrikeen of the idol worshipers that we worship them just that we can draw nearer and closer to allah so what is worshipping them is not necessarily only limited in prayer bowing and prostrating tawaf is worshipping them slaughtering animals for them is worshipping them calling them at times of distress save me i'm in a dilemma i'm in a calamity oh prophet of allah protect me from what i fear all of this is worshipping them though they claim that they are worshiping allah through them we don't have anyone to to be intermediate between us and allah azzawajal allah says in the quran invoke me and i shall respond to you i shall answer you this is what allah says and you say no no no we'd rather take a different route this would take you straight to hell so tell your father that what he's doing is mentioned in the quran and it is totally prohibited"
