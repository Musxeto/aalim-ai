  "title": "Who can be a Proxy in a Marriage Contract during Video Call, Phone, or Online Marriages",
  "transcript": "Salman from India I'm thinking of getting married through video call and I want to know which out of the following is the more appropriate or the correct way according to the Sunnah the option one is the guardian of the bat himself makes the hijab so video call to the groom who is on the other side sitting along with the waitresses and the option two is the guardian appoints and tells someone to become his proxy and do the job uh so that the marriage can take place in one sitting and who can be uh a unknown Muslim can he be his proxy okay first of all the win-win situation is when the witnesses and the groom personally know the guardian so let's assume we are from the same Village from the same city and the groom and the guard the the witnesses they all know the guardian so there's no ambiguity no way of impersonating someone else if this is done through video call and there is mutual Trust so the guardian and the girl trust that the groom would not simply do the nikah and run away not to be found because this is binding if he runs away how can they get a separation how can they prove to the Muslim judge that they got married if they can't get their hands on their Witnesses it's a dodgy issue but basically speaking when all the conditions are fulfilled and there is mutual trust we know the guy he's not going to run away we know his family then this is okay if the guardian would want to appoint a proxy or someone to have power of attorney to give his daughter in marriage to this guy this is okay he doesn't have to be a relative he doesn't have to be a mahram but he has to be a Muslim such a person cannot be a non-muslim he must be a Muslim and the same applies for ensuring that this power of attorney was legit legal and not ambiguous or fabricated and Allah Knows Best foreign"
