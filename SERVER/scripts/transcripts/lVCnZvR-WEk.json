  "title": "Can we make money from Youtube (Monetize)?",
  "transcript": "but he's from india can we make money out of youtube i think the only way to make money out of youtube is through ads and giving ads is not permissible because you are voluntary allowing them to put ads on your material in order for you to collect money regardless whether the ads are or haram and most likely it's haram because it's filled with music and inappropriate material so if you click on monetizing it this means that you give them the permission to add advertise on your channel and anyone who comes in will see this haram which you're making money off out of and this is totally haram for you to earn"
