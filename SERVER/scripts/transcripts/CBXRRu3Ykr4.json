  "transcript": "h√ºseyin says that's taking your socks or shoes off after wiping over them nullify your Woodill we know that we're supposed to wash our feet when performing ablution for prayer but there is another way which is after performing woudl and you wear your socks if you nullify your would or afterwards or break it you may perform another wouldl butt wipe on your socks for a resident for 40 for 24 hours for a traveler for 72 hours now he's saying that assume I pray treasure and I went to the office and then overtime was due so I wiped over my socks in woudl and when I went to the Masjid I took off my socks so does this break my wall do the answer is no your rule is valid but you may not wipe on your socks if you wear them again unless you perform a real waddle with washing your feet first so taking off your socks does not nullify or break your woudl exactly like if I wake make wudu and a wipe over my hair and then I go to the barbershop and I shave my head so by losing my hair does this mean that I've broken my wood oh no not at all"
