  "title": "Can we Print Names of NonMuslim Football Players on a Jersey & Wear Them",
  "transcript": "Sadman from Bangladesh Sadman Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh are we allowed to print the name of football players on the back of our jersey? Is it halal or farah? Are we allowed to do what? Print the name of football players on the back of our jersey On the back of your? Jersey Jetski? No Jersey Oh ok so you want to put the name of non-Muslim football players on the back of your jersey or your t-shirt. Is this allowed? The answer is no. We Muslims have our dignity and honor. We are proud individuals. I do not worship what you worship and you don't worship what I worship. You have your religion I have mine. Who says Allah has three and Allah has a son and Allah has a wife? Where is your Islam? Where is your dignity? Where is your honor? So this is totally prohibited and unbefitting of a real Muslim. Unfortunately the vast majority of Muslims don't have this in them. May Allah Azza wa Jal guide them all."
