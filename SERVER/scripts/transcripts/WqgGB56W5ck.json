  "title": "Does listening to Surah Kahf on Friday have the same benefit as reading it?",
  "transcript": "[Music] regarding reciting surah till kath on friday can listening to the recitation suffice to gain the benefit of this recitation uh on friday so we know that we can read surat al-qaf it's written from the mushaf or just simply play the mp3 or the clip and listen to it or ask someone to recite it and we listen to it so would it suffice the answer is no the prophet alice islam instructed us to read it so those who can read it they have to do it visually those who memorize it they can recite it they have to do that listening to it would not suffice for the reward and allah azzawajal knows best you"
