  "transcript": "Gulay from Turkey Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Yes so I started taking online university classes and the university asks before being able to take the final exam they ask a single question in which there are only two options either to agree or to disagree and in the question they say by selecting agree below I hereby affirm that I have read their honor code and that on my honor as a student of their university I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance no problem in saying agree because you have no options and you are forced to do it so say agree and do not cheat and do not lie afterwards Thank you"
