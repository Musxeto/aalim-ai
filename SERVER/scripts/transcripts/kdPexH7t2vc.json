  "transcript": "[Music] this is from turkey i'm gonna ask on her behalf because she left accidentally okay so she was asking if um exfoliation was allowed like the peeling of the skin not the peeling but removal of the skin exfoliation is that allowed okay i will answer inshallah fidan from turkey says what's the ruling on peeling the skin see if the skin is dead as in the case of having layers of dead skin on your feet especially at the soil or at the heels and you remove that this is permissible because this is taking something that's harmful that is not a normal thing this is an abnormality but if peeling the skin means that you apply certain creams or certain procedure to your face to peel off the the outer layer which changes the color which makes you younger this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion that it is this is not permissible there is a hadith but the hadith is disputed whether it's authentic or not however it falls under the category of changing the creation of allah because there is no valid reason for that yes if someone has a change of color in their face due to illness due to sunburn due to something like that and they need to get it treated and part of the treatment is to peel off this the old dying skin yeah this would be acceptable because this is removing a deficiency removing a defect removing something that's abnormal but when we come to beautification beautification is permissible if it's temporary so applying creams uh applying makeup all of this is halal and permissible because it's temporary it's for a short while half a day a day and then it's removed providing that nan mahram do not see it at all because this is prohibited even if it's for one hour must not look at it but if someone goes for and this is unfortunate among the muslim women and also among those who are called men we see tattooing i've seen tattoos on some of my mahram women and they say it's for six months and it's been a year and a half now and it's still there no doubt they are cursed by allah azzawajal because the prophet said as in the hadith of abdullah masood allah curses the one who does this and people nowadays don't care so what let allah curse them and this is a bad indication on how a person may end his life because such people even if they pray and fast when their death comes do you think they will be successful in saying if they've been living all of their lives cursed by allah azza not caring about halal and haram only interested in following their whims and desires who cares about sharia who cares about whether allah says we're going to do whatever everybody else is doing do you think that they'll be successful in saying allah to be their last word that's very doubtful a person dies according to what he had lived upon not according according to what he wishes and this is why this is the most scary moment in our lives the the hour and the moment of death because we don't know what our ending is going to be so peeling the skin according to the most authentic opinion of scholars is not permissible if it is for beautification purposes you"
