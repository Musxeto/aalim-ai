  "transcript": "uh afrina well this question is gone faiza saeed says if someone i helped once financially keeps coming to me again and again for different needs shall i continue helping her in my capacity or can i excuse politely this is totally up to you it is as described earlier what you do for the sake of allah is for the sake of allah you'll be rewarded for that but if you are inclined that this person is using you and you've seen evidences that she's using the money for things that are not as she said in this case you have all the right to apologize diplomatically and not give her anything the biggest fear i have is that you continue to give while doubtful in your heart and maybe snapping one day and spoiling everything that you've done by saying didn't i give you so much why are you abusing my money why are you asking me every time you ask me i give you allah this is a catastrophe you should not give her anything if you're going to reach that level because this is known as and it is one of the major sins in islam the prophet said free will never enter jannah and allow that would not speak to him not look at them and not have mercy upon them the one who has his garment or trousers below his ankle and almanan the one who always goes to the people who he had helped in the past and remind them of his help didn't i give you this and that didn't i help you admit your child in scolding this is a major sin so um i would say it is up to you totally if you feel that she's sincere and she's in need and she thinks well of you then allah has made you made her a door and a gate for you to jannah the more you help her you enter gender because she's needy but if you're inclined that she's lying or using you well you fooled me once shame on you you fool me twice shame on me"
