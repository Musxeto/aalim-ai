  "transcript": "Halima from France. Yes sir, I'm taking care of your grandmother and she had urine all over herself so we might jilbab. I was wondering the urine might, it might possibly like 95% touched my jilbab but I'm unable to smell the urine on my jilbab and I want to offer my salah, can I pray, will it be valid if I should offer my salah with it and listen to the Quran? Halima, everything is pure until proven otherwise. Your jilbab is pure. Having 5% doubt doesn't impact it. Having 99% doubt does not impact it. You have to have 100% certainty that urine has transferred from your grandma to your jilbab. In this case, you must wash that area in order for you to pray. That's it. Reading the Quran, listening to Quran has no impact with this urine and Allah knows best."
