  "transcript": "Jumana from the UK. So around a week ago I checked for my menses and I saw that I was dry for around five hours so I did also and then the next day I got discharged around maybe 10 a.m and when I checked around like half five p.m it was clear discharge but there was like a tiny bit it was like a tiny bit of gray within it but I think it was like dirt or something like that so I did a ghusl again but my question to you my question to you the ghusl you performed yesterday did you perform it because you were certain you saw the sign of your purity when I was dry okay but were you certain that this is your sign of purity um I was like 90 percent certain no this is not enough you have to be 100 percent certain and some sisters whenever the menses stops and they wipe and they see it dry they immediately go ahead with it other scholars say you have to insert a little a tampoon that would ensure that there is no color discharge so once you do this and it comes out clean this is your purity you are 100 percent certain that you're pure take your ghusl and pray if you see other discharges the following day or days later on don't pay any attention to them and Allah azza wa jal knows best"
