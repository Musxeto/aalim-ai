  "transcript": "Raqib from Bangladesh, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, I am 19 years old and I am pursuing my education. My father died two years back and me, my mom and my sister are the ones who inherited him. He left off some properties and wealth and my mother is the one who is in charge of everything. I didn't yet take the responsibility of my inherited portion yet, so is she the one who is responsible and accountable for calculating and paying the zakat? The answer is yes, she is the one. As long as she has the guardianship and control over your wealth and you cannot get your hands on your portion of inheritance, she is the one who is responsible to give zakat every year since the time of your father's death. And you have to be diplomatic, obedient, dutiful to your mother and try to explain to her how to do things Islamically."
