  "transcript": "Fareed from Germany Selma from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I want to ask if I speak with my father for example about like he said like about prophets and sometimes I feel like a little bit awkward if I so I don't know if he's talking of knowledge or not so I I don't like I I'm a little bit shy so I just say oh okay but in my head I don't like like I don't think okay I think we've lost Fareed but his question is maybe clear that his father speaks about some of the prophets and messengers of Allah Azza Wa Jal now Fareed doesn't know whether his father is speaking with knowledge or not yet because of his confusion he simply says yes okay and approves of what his father is saying the funny thing is that Fareed also doesn't know so could his ignorance justify saying to his father that no you're speaking without knowledge without him knowing whether the information his father is giving is authentic or not of course not you should try to refrain from saying this is wrong unless you are certain it's wrong so as long as you don't have knowledge remain silent until you verify it and check it and then you may ask and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best"
