  "title": "Skipping prayer is a major sin? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "First of all, it is a major sin, one of the \nmajor sins, to delay or to postpone a prayer   from its time. So if you skip a prayer until the time \nis over, you've committed the major sin, according to the vast majority of scholars.   A group of scholars said \nthat doing this deliberately takes you out of the fold of Islam for one \nprayer. But the vast majority of Muslims say you've committed a major sin. For your \nsister to abandon Salat for three days just out of laziness, she is in severely great \ndanger. And whether she left the fold of Islam or not, as I said earlier, it's an issue of \ndispute among scholars. One should not mess up with such issues. One should fear Allah Azza \nwa Jal, and acknowledge that the first thing the people of Hell answer when the \npeople of Jannah, of Paradise, ask them, why are you in Hell? The \nfirst reason they give is,   we were not among the \nworshippers, we did not pray. So to postpone a prayer and then feel guilty, well \nthat's good for you if you are sincere in your remorse,   not just shrugging your shoulders and moving \non with your life as if nothing had happened. The question is, should she make up for   the prayers missed in these \nthree days? The answer is no. And even if she prays them a thousand \ntimes, Allah will not accept it from her, because each prayer is prescribed to a \nspecific time, has a beginning and an end. You can't pray it before the time, and you \nalso cannot pray it after the time has ended. So she cannot offer them back, and may \nAllah Azza wa Jal have mercy upon us all."
