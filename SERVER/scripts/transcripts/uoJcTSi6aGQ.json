  "transcript": "ruble from portugal my mother he goes to uh majira is like a place where you know the worship like did i mean in odarga he goes to like something place something like that and i told i explained her i know not to go there because it's such kind of and and i try to make her understand but yeah every time i try to do that i felt she didn't understand and she'd go alone there without anyone without nothing so in that case i stopped talking to her because i told her if you go there then i will not talk to you so is it a right decision to do first of all it is prohibited to go to dargahs to graveyards where they worship the peers and the deceased and those who are buried they have tombs and they have sacrifices and they light candles and they give food to that all of this is not permissible if your mother insists on going there you must not attend and you must not accompany her because this is shirk now not talking to her is problematic because allah azzawajal ordered us to be in contact and to be dutiful and obedient to our parents even if our parents instruct us and order us to do shirk and most likely not talking to her would not add any value rather it would increase the gap between you and her and the distance so i would highly recommend that you keep being dutiful and kind to her while inserting little dosages of da'wah of tawheed reminding her of what is mentioned in the quran reminder of an ayah even if it's irrelevant to a shirk just reminder of an ayah or of a hadith connect her back to the quran and to the sunnah bring her back to islam little by little until allah expands her chest to accept that this is the religion of allah then it will find its impact insha allah you"
