  "title": "Can Muslim women wear colored Abayas? Assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Consider Subscribing ğŸ˜„ [Sheikh] Muhammad from theÂ \nPhilippines? [Muhammad] my question is,Â Â  uh what other colors of abaya that aÂ \nMuslim woman can wear? For example,Â Â  is a color grade abaya permissible to wear for aÂ \nMuslim woman? [Sheikh] Colored Abaya, and Abaya by the way is the outer garment that a womanÂ \nwears, so if a woman wears a shirt and a skirt,Â Â  she has to wear an externalÂ \ndress, covering her physique,Â Â  and usually it is black, as black is the mostÂ \nconservative color that draws no attentionÂ Â  and does not provoke any desire. The companionsÂ \nof the Prophet ï·º among the females, of course,Â Â  used to wear such abayas in that color, inÂ \nthe black. Mother Aisha tells us that whenÂ Â  the fajr prayer was over, the femaleÂ \ncompanions used to go back home, unrecognizedÂ Â  due to the blackness that they're wearingÂ \nand the blackness of the salat ending time,Â Â  and unlike the Hanafi Madhhab, the vastÂ \nmajority of the time the Prophet ï·º used toÂ Â  conclude the prayer al-IslamÂ \nof fajr when it was still dark.Â Â  So mother Ayesha described that they usedÂ \nto wear black. Nevertheless, Islam is notÂ Â  restricted, and did not restrict women toÂ \nonly wearing black. It's a cultural thing.Â Â  Here in Saudi Arabia, the norm used to be thatÂ \nall women were black, so there was no distinction;Â Â  everybody was like everybody else.Â \nNowadays, unfortunately, women have,Â Â  I wouldn't say evolved like Darwinism,Â \nrather it's the opposite; nevertheless,Â Â  they wear colored abayas culturallyÂ \nthis wasn't acceptable. NowadaysÂ Â  maybe, maybe not. In other countries, if you goÂ \nto Egypt, if you go to Kuwait, if you go to theÂ Â  Emirates, this is normal if you go to morocco thisÂ \nis acceptable. However, we have to be careful notÂ Â  to wear colors that would not be appropriate.Â \nSo a woman wearing a red abaya, a pink abaya,Â Â  that is a little bit extravagant, and may lureÂ \nmeant to look and may attempt them because thisÂ Â  is worn to draw attention and this defies theÂ \npurpose of the hijab. Wearing gray, dark blue,Â Â  dark green, all of these are okay, In Sha Allah,Â \nwithout any problem, and Allah knows best."
