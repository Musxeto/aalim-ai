  "transcript": "saudi arabia he says what's the ruling on visiting it's an area that has to be decided and we have to know the borders of it because this is mentioned in an authentic hadith the prophet sallam prohibited people to enter it and he said that if you must there is no other way you can continue a journey except through it then you have to make it as quick as possible and you have to pretend that you're crying and fearful from allah's wrath to descend upon you like it descended upon them and annihilated them all together however this area has to be defined because nowadays madina saleh is a name given to a whole region yet the area that the punishment and the torment of allah descended upon is a limited area so you have to go to the experts and ask them where this area is where where does it begin and where does it end and this is the area that you must not enter you must not come close to other than that it is no problem insha'allah"
