  "transcript": "um Amina From the Emirates so I was going to ask can I thinking if I'm alone or I'm with group of other girls can I sing different songs um it doesn't have any Haram things in it or it's not permissible for a woman to chant and sing poetry or or lyrics in front of other women or when she's alone as long as the song itself is halal the lyrics are Halal and the chances of people going to listen to the original song are negligible because the original song does have musical instruments and Haram things in it if these conditions are fulfilled there's nothing wrong in a woman singing for herself or for other women something that is halal and Allah Knows Best"
