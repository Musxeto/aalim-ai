  "title": "Can we change our intention from 1 rakah to 3 rakahs while praying Witr or night prayers",
  "transcript": "rush it says if one has the intention of performing one Rekha Witter before the start of this prayer but then while he was praying he adds another two rakahs to make it three units instead is this okay the answer is no your intention in the beginning was to pray WonderCon now you wandered a little bit away from salat and all of a sudden you find yourself in the second record reciting the fatiha you said mmm Wow this is second raka what should I do what a waste let me finish three records with her no this is not valid the moment you realize that you've prayed a second Drecker or a third raka you should immediately sit for tisha hood because the second and the third are void what you intended for was one the same thing happens to a lot of the Muslims when they are praying night prayer for example two rakahs and they find themselves and the third raka so they said what the heck let's complete for this is not permissible this is what you intended to do in the beginning which is true you must stick to that you rush it intended one raka watcher you must stick to that and Allah knows best"
