  "transcript": "Sayyid from Singapore Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Okay, let's say if someone has a thick beard and they put oil in it to smoothen it so before making wudu do they have to like get the oil out by using soap or something? And I just wanted to say Sheikh like your beard looks very well groomed so if you have like any tips like how to maintain a thick beard that will be really helpful, thanks Barakallah Afiq, first of all I don't do anything to my beard at all Alhamdulillah, I don't groom it, I just brush it once or twice a day, I shampoo it whenever my wife complains of the smell but I try to my level best to soak it in perfume so it's always smelling nice Alhamdulillah, I don't use any conditioners or oil or the likes, it's from Allah Azza wa Jal, Alhamdulillah Secondly, the oil usually is absorbed by the skin and by the hair so it does not constitute a layer as in the case of hair gel for example because hair gel you feel that it's like wood, it feels like there is a layer a substance and this prevents the water from reaching that area, in the hair it's permissible to use hair gel and to wipe over it in wudu because this was done by the Prophet ﷺ so this is an exception, other than that the hair of the beard as we use oil to it, yes it's oily if I touch it but it's usually observed and that's just the lubricants that is felt not that there is a layer on top of it so therefore if you just wash your beard and this is what's required to wash the face and the external part of the beard, the sunnah is to put water in your hand and you do this and this symbolic gesture does not cover your whole face and the chins and the jaws and what's underneath, it's just what the Prophet ﷺ did and we follow suit and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
