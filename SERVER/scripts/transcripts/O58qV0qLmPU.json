  "transcript": "[Music] now his third question about youtube drama movies etc these things are like a knife when you purchase a knife you can cut the bread the meat the fruit and you can harm people with the knife so it depends on how you use it today we know that youtube like many social media platforms spy on you especially on our children and they infest it with things that they know may attract the children so if a person makes a mistake by clicking something that is haram for the next few generations maybe decades he'll always find on the side things related to that haram thing he saw only by mistake now you can imagine what they do to our children and how they uh try their level best to brainwash them and to put things related to lgbt to homosexuality etc so it is dangerous now dramas movies soap operas netflix etc these things the vast majority of his hara because it has women free mixing it has aura exposure it is filled with music with lies with things that are definitely not related to islam so these things are haram yes if you watch not not jio for example the wild the wild cats something of nature that has no music nothing haram in it this is permissible insha allah but this is quite rare"
