  "transcript": "Afzaan from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi There is a person who has severed OCD Who has what? There is a person who has Kufr, OCD Okay So he thinks something about Kufr intentionally and then blocks it Sometimes he gets some feelings in his heart that he is content with that thought Like he thinks of something Kufr and then he blocks it But in his heart he gets a feeling of contentment and he wants to get rid of that feeling He hates Kufr and fear of doing it So he is in Al-Qafir Akhi, is this person a practicing Muslim, yes or no? Yes Is he afraid of hellfire, yes or no? Yes In this case, all of these are whispers from Shaytan trying to get him out of the fold of Islam His heart is content with Islam He fears Allah, he loves Allah, he practices Islam So all what Shaytan does is whisper You open this little door for Shaytan, he puts his toe You open it a little bit, he puts his foot You open it a little bit, he comes with his half of his body It's your mistake You are the one who is opening the door Issues of Kufr relate to belief and conviction Not any whispers that randomly come into your head And you would assume that, oh I am out of the fold of Islam My wife is not my wife anymore, the marriage is broken I can't inherit, my father when he dies, people can inherit me, blah blah blah All of this as if you are having a house of cards and you took a card and it all collapsed No, it doesn't work like this Your Iman is not a house of cards Your Iman is something that is deeply rooted in your heart Cemented with Quran and prayers and dhikr You can't allow Shaytan just to simply blow at it and it all collapses So it has to have conviction, belief, true hypocrisy True rejection of Islam, which you don't have With the evidence that you do not speak about it, you do not act upon it You hate it, you fear Allah, you fear hellfire All of these are evidences that you have to ignore it and move on"
