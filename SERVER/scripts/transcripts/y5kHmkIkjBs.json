  "transcript": "and this means that if I take antibiotics if I take Valtteri in shots if I take insulin if I take penicillin anything that does not nourish me that does not take the role of eating and drinking this doesn't nullify your fasting so if someone says if I have to take vaccines does it affect my fasting no it doesn't I have to extract a tooth and the doctor gives me what they call it tranquilizers or whatever or anesthesia does it affect my fasting the answer is No"
