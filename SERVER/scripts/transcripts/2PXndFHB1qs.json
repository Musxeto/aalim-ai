  "transcript": "it says the second question where does our soul go while we sleep the souls are taken when we are asleep allah says in the quran it is allah who takes away the souls at the time of their death and those that die not during their sleep allah also says he takes your souls at night when you are asleep and the prophet allah is used to invoke allah after waking up from sleep by saying alhamdulillah all praise is due to allah who gave us life after death which refers to that sleeping is the brethren of death and this is why the people in paradise do not sleep they never sleep in paradise because sleeping is the brother of death so without any doubt allah takes the souls when we sleep whether it's night sleep or daytime sleep once you sleep that's it however this does not mean that the souls are taken out of the body because there's still some relationships between the soul and the body even while one is asleep and even where allah azza takes the soul where does it go this is in allah's knowledge and it doesn't add any value to us to know that or to understand that we have to simply believe in it and allah knows"
