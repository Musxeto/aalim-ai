  "transcript": "from bangladesh there are two mosques here and one is closer to a house and other is a bit far so the imam of the mosque that is closer to a house he makes a mistake in the fatty cat that nullifies the salah that he is able to recite it correctly so i don't play behind him i go to the mosque that's a bit far but during fajr when it is dark and the streets are empty a pack of wild street dogs they stay in the middle of the road and some of these dogs are aggressive as they have rushed at me before so i fear harm from them so what should i do in this case if the imam of the nearby masjid can pronounce the fatiha correctly and does not and the mistake he is doing is something that is unforgettable unforgivable so such a mistake that you're certain that nullifies the fatiha you cannot pray there go after the prayer is over and make another jamar but if the mistake yeah and is something that can be tolerated so instead of saying he says this is accepted in some and due to the similarity or he says this is also accepted and can be tolerated so you have to first figure out what mistake uh he is doing as for the faraway mosque carry a baseball bat with you whenever one of them dogs approach you strike one then none of them will ever approach you again these are wild dogs anything that is wild and attacks us we have all the right in islam to defend ourselves and to attack back even if we have to kill that animal or that person who's aggressing against us and wanting harm for us this is one of the basics in islam that you protect yourself protect your family and protect your wealth you"
