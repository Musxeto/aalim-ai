  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the U.S so Sheikh um I've been \nwatching a lot of quote-unquote Ghost Hunters on   YouTube these Ghost Hunters utilize equipment to \npresumably communicate with ghosts obviously we   as Muslims know that ghosts aren't real and that \nthese people are actually speaking with demons now   shake these Ghost Hunters utilize different types \nof equipment for their paranormal investigations   some in the paraphernalia in these \ninvestigations include the Spirit box   and the EVP which are devices allegedly capable \nof having humans communicate with demons but   the authenticity of these devices are disputed \nand they may be bogus another device which is   perhaps more authentic is the rempod which is a \ndevice that has a magnetic field surrounding it   if demons penetrate this magnetic field the device \nstarts emitting sound along with blinking lights   so sheikh I'm interested in perhaps purchasing \na select few items to determine if there is any   demon in my house and subsequently recite the last \ntwo verses of Suratul Baqarah in conjunction with   other powerful verses from the Quran mind you I \ndo remember reading somewhere that communication   with demons in Islam no matter the intention is \nstrictly forbidden to my knowledge communication   with the demons isn't necessary for the rempod \nto work so would it be permissible for me to   use device solely as opposed to the Spirit box and \nthe EVP which would require me to communicate with   these demons and are probably fake devices which \nare worthless crap may Allah bless you sheikh first of all what you see is old bogus \nis all fabrication they are fooling the   masses with these things to intimidate them \nto make them live in a fantasy and all these   rubbish is rubbish so regardless of the names of \nthe devices they're claiming that may allow you to   communicate with the Jinn we know that Allah tells \nus that the Jinn can see us and we cannot see them   and we know that they have no power over us as \nlong as we protect ourselves with athkar save your   money and save your Imaan why would I say save \nyour Imaan because the moment you go that route   shaytan is gonna haunt you and he's going to make \nyou think that yep I've established contact with   the Jinn and I have jinn in my house the machine \nsays that there are presence of the Jinn so what   every Muslim knows that there are Jinn in his \nhouse that you're not all over us are they with   you Sheikh within the studio yes they are you \nwon't have a Jinn coming behind me I hope you   don't uh and and saying that here I am so there is \na Jinn or number of Genies they're all around us   even when we enter the toilet they're \ninside the toilets so how can I answer   the call of nature the Prophet (Peace and \nBlessings Upon Him) tells us say Bismillah   this is a visor and a screen between the eyes the \nvision of the Jinn and our own Aura they can't   see us when we take off our clothes in the toilet \nif we say Bismillah so this is a way way cheaper   solution and alternative to what you have come up \nwith don't buy any stuff don't watch these movies   or shows because they're all bogus you don't \nneed Ghostbusters you have Ayatul Kursi you have   uh the last two verses of uh Surat al-baqarah \nthat prevents the Jinn from entering the Devils   from entering your home for three days and \nnights and if you believe in the Quran the   Sunnah you're safe if you say you're athkar in \nthe morning in the evening after the fard salah   before going to bed and before leaving your house \nyou're protected but to believe in such nonsense   and bogus stuff coming to you from the kuffar \nabout the Jinn this is totally unaccepted okay and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford \nit that's good for you if you cannot you're   entitled for one free session and this is for \neverybody if they can affirm by Allah that they   cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give \nthem one free session without a problem a full   half an hour so come to me and let's speak \nabout it inshallah within the following two   days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign"
