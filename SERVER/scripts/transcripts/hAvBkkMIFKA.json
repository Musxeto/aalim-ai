  "transcript": "Salman from Bahrain Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah So Sheikh I tried a couple of months ago. I tried to invite a non-muslim to Islam he he told me that Islam is very restrictive even music is haram and I couldn't I couldn't answer him on this one because I didn't know I couldn't know what to say about music so What is the hikmah of? Making music haram. Well, there are many hikmahs. There are many Justifications and wisdoms behind making music haram the first and foremost important part of Wisdom is to test Whether you are a servant or a master If you're a master, you would not Accept the ruling that music is haram. It doesn't make any sense and This would take you straight to hell Like it did with Satan. Satan was ordered to Prostrate to Adam by Allah all the angels prostrated Satan says whoops. Nope. I'm better than him so He did not buy it He did not comply. He did not submit So the end result he's in hell for eternity one of the hikmah is that Allah examines your Submissiveness and compliance with his orders one of the hikmahs is to purify your heart show me one Particular or a single individual who listens to music and he's not addicted to it you can tell their addiction once they get into the car and they find that the radio and the DVD player on the CD or whatever means of listening to music and their stereo is Busted it's not working. Let them take a drive for half an hour. They can't they feel so empty They feel the void in their heart. They're so frustrated and angry because there's nothing filling their ears as They're addicted to it go to an aerobic class or an RB class and You see them jumping and dancing and going up forward and backwards Turn off the music boom nothing. Where's the energy? It's gone We need music. We need this to get this energy. This energy is satanic It's a it's a mood changer when you're depressed and you listen to something that cheers you up You become happy and when you're happy and listen to something that is depressing you become depressed this kind of addiction is prohibited in Islam Islam wants you to be independent depending only on Allah relying on Allah despite the fact that most if not all lyrics of such songs and musics that we listen today is Corruptive is Spoiled is bad is it encourages violence sex it degrades women and the likes and Allah azza wa jal knows best You"
