  "title": "Drawing back from Islamic studies to pursue secular education? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "pato from germany after somebody converted to islam and is working hard to get knowledge in islam is it permissible or what is the ruling on drawing back on studying islam in favor of secular studies like university okay i will answer inshallah so so many times people who accept islam they have this enthusia and enthusiasm in them enthusiastic to study islam and quran and memorize in arabic but after a while they come to a fork of the road where they find that okay then what and they listen to the sound of reason which says learning islam is an easy thing to do you don't have to devote your time and life 24 7 just to learn islam there is essential sciences that you have to learn which your prayers are not valid without your akida are not valid without and your rituals without knowing them are not valid so you have to know how to pray but this doesn't take a full semester it takes maybe a few hours maybe a day at most however there are little details that require more studying and research and devotion and circles of knowledge and reading books but these are for people who are students of knowledge or scholars so sometime we have to be realistic we live in a world that nobody is going to give us money for free we have to work we have to earn and if i don't get a degree in medicine or engineering or administration or whatever if i don't have a job as a teacher or as a clerk or whatever i will not be able to feed myself and get married and get and pay for my children therefore there is nothing wrong in reducing the amount of knowledge you've been so eager to pursue in order to focus for a limited period of time on your academia on your work so that you can sustain a long-term relationship with having this imbalance your religion your family your health and everything else so i hope this answers your question"
