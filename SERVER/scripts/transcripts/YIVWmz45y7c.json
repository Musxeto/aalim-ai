  "title": "When the Imam says AllahuAkbar when going to ruku or sujood, do the followers also say it?",
  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s again my question is regarding the congregation prayer when the imam says allah to go to the roku or to go so i always get this question and i did not ask muhammad if he sent it to the website or not but either way saying allahu akbar is mandatory when moving from one pillar to the other during prayers for the imam for the follower of the imam and for the individual this is a mandatory act to pronounce allahu akbar when going for roku or going for sujud or rising from sujud etc for all of them and if a person drops it intentionally his prayer is invalid if you drop one takbir intentionally the prayer is invalid if you dropped it out of forgetfulness and you were praying you're a follower behind an imam the imam carries it for you and you're exempted because it wasn't done deliberately and if you were alone or you were the imam and you dropped it forgetfully you have to compensate this by offering to sujud of sahu before the salaam and allah knows best you"
