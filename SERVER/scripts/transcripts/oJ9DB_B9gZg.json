  "transcript": "so diamond says can i ask something video call married in islam is it halal i think we've answered this like many times but again for the benefit of the doubt oh ambiguity of the identity of those participating so i'm now with you guys in a video call and i claim my name to be abdullah the son of abdullah man and i would like to get married to your daughter uncle the uncle doesn't know me he doesn't know if my name is abdullah or my name is asam he doesn't know where i come from what i do so if he doesn't know me and the witnesses do not know me i don't know her father whether he is her father truly or just an imposter coming to give his approval because the girl is with me in the same city and we met over the internet or we go to the same school or we work together and we would like to make our relationship halal so i said i'd like to marry you and she's an easygoing woman she said okay let's get married no no it has to be done properly where is your father well my father is back home okay let's get his approval she knows that her father does not approve of it so she talks to an uncle to the janitor of their building back home and she tells him i'll pay you a hundred dollars and you pretend to be my father and i see him on a video uh chat or uh skype or whatever and he says yes my son i give you my daughter in marriage and i say i accept her marriage and there are two witnesses whether in my side or on her side this marriage isn't valid you have to identify and make sure of the identity of the participant if this is possible then the marriage is legit insha allah yet we have to always give the warning that i get tens of cases every month of people complaining that they got this type of marriage and now the girl doesn't know where the boy is and she wants to call this marriage off she wants to divorce but he is not divorcing and she cannot find file any type of huller because the marriage was not registered well um it is your mistake it is your father's mistake don't ever do something that is not documented because you will suffer later on for breaking the law for trusting people who do not deserve to be trusted and allah azzawajal knows best"
