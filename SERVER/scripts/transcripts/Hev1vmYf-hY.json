  "transcript": "[Music] his second question was about psychiatric illnesses and what to do when a psychiatrist prescribes medication for anxieties of bipolar etc illnesses if the psychiatrist is a practicing muslim and he knows what he's doing this is permissible because non-muslims or non-practicing muslim psychiatrists may prescribe medication for the least problem they see prozac is this is off the shelf you can just prescribe it to anyone and this is not realistic not true there are illnesses that can be cured by dialogue with the psychiatrist he talks to you he opens your eyes he fixes the way you analyze things without any medication so when you go to a psychiatrist do your level best to go to someone who is authorized and someone who is a practicing muslim because there are psychiatrists that are not practicing they may look practicing but they're not truthful they're not honest no go to people who are well known and insha allah if they give you medication this is part of the job and this is part of their knowledge and they know what to prescribe so that you're not addicted to it and whether you can skip it or not"
