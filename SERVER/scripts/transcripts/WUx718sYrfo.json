  "transcript": "This is Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Alhamdulillah So Sheikh, my question is the following If your opinion, as everyone knows, is that Niqab is obligatory So if a woman is a blind follower of you And she marries a man who follows a respected scholar Like Sheikh al-Albani for example Who says Niqab is mustahab But it's not sinful to show the face Is it permissible for the woman to obey her husband Once in a while when he tells her to take Niqab off? The answer is no Because her conviction and belief Is based on an opinion Which is based on the Quran and the Sunnah Which she believes Whatever her husband believes Is not something superior in a higher degree Rather it is a lower degree So if the opposite was applicable Then we would have told her to obey her husband For example, if she follows the opinion That the Niqab is not mandatory And she does not wear it And her husband says I believe that the Niqab is mandatory For the following reasons from the Quran and the Sunnah Which is a better selection So what is better at the sight of Allah? To wear the Niqab or not to wear the Niqab? The answer is definitely to wear the Niqab So if the husband is asking her to do something Against her conviction but It is better at the sight of Allah She is obliged to obey him But not the other way around"
