  "transcript": "Umm Maymuna from Bangladesh. My question is, if someone has wronged someone else and he now wants to seek that person's forgiveness, is it enough to say, forgive me for any wrong thing I have done to yourself? Because that person may not remember how he was wronged. So is it enough to just ask for a general forgiveness or does he have to specify? Jazakallahu Khairan. Yes, In Sha Allah, it is sufficient to ask someone, generally speaking, to forgive you. So if I've backbitten someone, and I know if I tell him that, listen I backbitt you a couple of years ago, and that would cause more rift between us or would cause him to insist on, what did you say? No, you have to say that. And it would cause more harm than good. Therefore I am permitted to go and say to him, listen Akhi, if you had done anything wrong to me in the past, may Allah forgive you, I forgive you. And if I had done anything wrong to you in the past, I would ask you to forgive me. Most likely everyone would say, may Allah forgive you. And that would be sufficient In Sha Allah. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it In Sha Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
