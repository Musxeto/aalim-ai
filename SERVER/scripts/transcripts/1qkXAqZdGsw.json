  "title": "Woman's class is going to another city, can she lie saying she was sick with a doctors note to avoid",
  "transcript": "Dima from Germany. On Monday my class is going somewhere which is in another city and usually like I would usually not go because traveling without a non-Mahram is not permissible. But if I don't go I have to bring a letter from a doctor that I'm sick. But I'm obviously not sick so I would need to lie. What should I do in this situation? Neither lie nor go. Just make it a no show. This is the only solution you have. It is not permissible for us to bend the rules. We have to adhere to the Shari'ah laws. Women cannot travel without a Mahram. Full stop. I have a situation. I have to travel. Let's look at the necessity. Is it a matter of life and death? No. It's just maybe I'll lose some marks. In this case this is not permissible. I may fail the exam. This is not a matter of life and death. Losing an exam or wasting a whole year. You will not be questioned in your grave nor on the Day of Judgment why did you fail that subject or repeat that year. You will be asked why did you travel without a Mahram? Why did you lie in this medical report? Muslims don't cheat and don't lie. Alternatives? Try to get one of your Mahrams on board to go with you. Not possible? Don't go and Allah knows best."
