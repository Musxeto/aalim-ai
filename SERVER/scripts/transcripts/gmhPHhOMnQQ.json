  "transcript": "hamza from bosnia uh shea i heard from a trustful person that when we are going to the masjid we can actually combine multiple intentions and get the rewards for all of them so could you please name a few intentions that we could combine while walking to the masjid to benefit as much as possible if i understand you correctly hamza and i hope you're still on the line with us that if i'm going to the masjid i can combine a number of intentions and i actually do not know intentions to be combined other than the prayer itself so what why are you going to the message to pray what are you going to pray i'm going to pray the father prayer so this is one intention if you say to me okay but i will also intend to pray that precedes the fart if i'm going for her for example there are four sunnahs of of uh prayer and i also would like to pray sunnah and maybe make a stihara all of these intentions are combined but it's in the salat not in walking so i don't know if i understand your question correctly please elaborate are you with us hamza yeah can you hear me i can hear you now so did i unders understand your question correctly uh not really say please so yeah i heard like only a couple of uh examples from this stressful person that was uh saying this so he said like we can combine like also to answer the call of moedin when he calls us that's like one intention and we can also intend like to be in the best spot in the first row etc so do get me now i get you but these things come by default they are not intended for themselves you're going early why are you going early you don't have to have the intention of breaking it up to say okay because i want to get as closer to the imam as possible and to get into the first row and to have 15 minutes to read the quran and to do this and you're going there generally speaking for all of these things and whatever goodness you can do so detailing it in this fashion i don't personally know anything that backs it up would i say it's a bad thing no it's not a bad thing to organize your thoughts and to know that if i go early i'm gonna reap the following benefits one two three four five and you always have them at the back of your mind this is a good thing but is it something that is known from the salaf or something that we are recommended to do i don't have any evidence to back this up and allah azza knows best you"
