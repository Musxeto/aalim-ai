  "title": "Scholarly consensus say we have to pray 20 Rakat in Taraweeh",
  "transcript": "foreign [Music] my question is regarding I read on Islam QA that the scholarly consensus is that um they said that we have to pray 20 raka and Imam Malik says we have to pray 36. now the most correct view is that one should not limit the number of Ayah the number of rakat and pray as much as possible now we those who prayed we still have a Hadith backing it up like so my question is Sheikh why is there why is there scholarly consensus on 20 where this uh this number 20 came from first of all when you say consensus it means that there is no one else who said something different but this is not the case you just said that Imam Malik says it's 36 raka and not 20 rakas so there's no consensus and we cannot have consensus when we have a Hadith and the prophets Hadith according to mother may Allah be pleased with her that the prophet Allah did not pray neither in Ramadan nor out of Ramadan more than 11 raqqa however this Hadith is challenged by another Hadith where it stated that he used to pray 13 rakas as per IBN Abbas and also Aisha may Allah be peace with them all so why did The Scholar say that it's okay to pray 20 because there is nothing limiting it where did they come from where did they come with this number this is the doing of Muslims since Allah knows when and it is not an issue where we should waste time disputing and arguing and fighting and pointing at one another that this is an innovator or this one is so extreme in his views Etc it's a very easy topic you want to pray 11 be my guest what's your evidence my evidence is that the prophet has some never exceeded 11 according to the authentic Hadith in this when she was asked okay good for you you want to pray 20 yes what's your evidence that Omar may Allah be pleased with him and the majority of the companions used to pray 20 rakas good for you you want to pray more serious it's okay there's nothing limiting it and if the people in the neighborhood are uh old geezers like myself and they don't have the energy to pray except seven rakas good for you there's nothing that compels us to pray a specific number let alone to fight and point fingers at one another and accuse one another of being an innovator and not loving the Sunnah Etc all of this is from shaytan Islam is an easy going religion you do what you like and if someone goes against your opinion that is not a crucial issue is not a uh a life or death matter alhamdulillah we have room in our religion to accept such differences Knows Best [Music] oh my God and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
