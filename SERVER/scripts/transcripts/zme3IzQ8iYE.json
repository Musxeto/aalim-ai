  "title": "Treatment through Telepathy Permissible? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ronna says is treatment through telepathy permissible in Islam now telepathy if I understand it correctly is part of the parapsychological phenomena it is something that has been lately studied and lots of theories and lots of things that are either related to science or not related to science and the vast majority is definitely not related to science telepathy is like when you have one of them smart phones then you want that you can charge without plugging in so telepathy is like this transferring information not via bluetooth nor Wi-Fi but through brainwaves so they claim that you can transfer information to someone's else head without communicating with them just by thinking of it and this is a little bit ridiculous because you read about this but you don't see it some say that no it does exist we have like deja Vu's when you see something and you remember being there doing that thing though you have not been there or done it in your life this could be your imagination your sub-conscience any other thing maybe your gin is doing this to you to confuse you mess up with your mind all options are open sure telepathy does not exist in the form that today's scientists claim no it does not exist we have never seen someone sitting on a chair and focusing on me and transferring to me data or information like they claim never happened so those who claim to have happened with them it's one at in a billion and if they want to do it with someone other than that who they claim they're doing it with it cannot be done but there is an incident and all those who talk about telepathy in Islam only use this example when Roman hot-bod may Allah be pleased with him was once given hot ba on a Friday and all of a sudden he interrupted the hotbar and he said yes idea tell Java yes idiot elgible so when he finished they asked him what are you talking about he said what did I say and he and they said that you said so and so and so he said I don't know this is something that just crossed my mind and I was unaware of saying it in some narrations it says that ice I thought I imagined that Surya who was the leader of an army fighting the Persians somewhere and that he was cornered and the Muslims were about to be defeated so I could not hold myself but shout yes area beware be careful and let the mountain be at your back and a month later when the news came and Satya came he said we were almost the same thing we were about to lose the battle and all of a sudden we heard the roamers voice shouting and this happened so those who talk about telepathy in Islam they always give this example and there is no evidence in that this is what we Muslims considered to be a Kurama see a miracle emerges a' is given only to the messengers of allah georgia a Kurama is something that is supernatural that is given to one of the followers of a messenger where allah azza wajal gives this as a favour and blessing to prove that the messenger this man is following is on the right path and the religion is the correct religion so there are so many kurama's mentioned in the quran for example the youth who went into the cave and slept for three and a hundred years three and nine hundred years the ghio nine so this was a Kurama a Kurama that was given to mariam when she were was told to shake the bank of a palm tree and ripe dates fall upon her if 20 men were to go and hold get hold of the trunk of a palm tree and shake it it would not move an inch yet by Miriam being ordered to do this and it fell on her then this is from Allah Azza WA JAL and Allah knows best therefore this hadith is only a Karami but telepathy claiming to have the healing power from a distance by just thinking about it or transferring information all of this is either done by jinn or by your sub-conscience it has no reality none whatsoever"
