  "title": "IF A DISBELIEVER OR APOSTATE GIVES THE ATHAAN OR SAYS THE SHAHADA, DOES HE ENTER ISLAM? Assimal",
  "transcript": "um my first question is um regarding if somebody's uh left a foot of islam by like um or somebody's just a carefree for example and they say the akama or they say the then or they say the declaration of faith after performing wado for example does that person become a muslim okay i will answer he says if someone left the fold of islam or if a disbeliever came and called the adhan would that be considered to be entering islam the answer is no this is not islam islam has to be done out of conviction and he has to announce the shahada he could be a kafir singing a song thinking that the adhan is a song and he likes the melody of it he could be a an apostate making fun and repeating the shahada again in the adhan or elsewhere just for the fun of it or mocking islam so this does not count as embracing islam"
