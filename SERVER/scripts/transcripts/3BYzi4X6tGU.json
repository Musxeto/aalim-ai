  "transcript": "say it from singapore i have a question regarding the recitation of the kalima shahada for a dying muslim okay basically it goes like this on the 23rd of december 2019 my father was in the hospital in on his death bed and the doctor called me on nine am prompting me to come down to the hospital as soon as possible and after which i i was at work i asked my i seek permission for my operations manager who was covering the duty of the team leader then and the operations manager released me two hours later which was 11 30 am and after which i finally head down to the hospital and when when i was still making my way to the hospital i received a phone call from a doctor informing me that my father had passed away and do take note that my father passed away without anyone being on his side and instead he passed away only in front of the doctors and the daughter is a non-muslim and from there i am not be able to know whether did my father manage to recite the karma shahada right before he passed away and do take note that my father was a very pious muslim he he prayed salah every day and gave zakat and you name it so my question here is that um if a muslim a biased muslim who passed away without anyone being on his side and without many presuming that he he did not nobody managed to whisper the kalima shahada on his ears or he is unable to whisper unable to recite the karima shahada will will allah grant him heaven even though he or she did not manage to recite the kalimantan god got your question got your question said i will answer inshallah it from singapore he says in a long story that his father who was pious who used to pray and give zakat and was a practicing muslim passed away last year maybe and he was not attended by any of the muslims he knew only non-muslim doctors so he says can he go to jannah without uttering the shahada first of all how would you know that he did not utter the shahada you have no evidence secondly why do you think negatively of your father it's a rule of thumb that whoever lives on something dies on it as long as your father lived as a righteous practicing muslim praying uh doing his athkar giving zakat fasting ramadan you should not worry at all that he did not say the shahada because saying the shahada is a plus when we hear it not hearing it is not a minus it could have been between him and allah azzawajal he could have said it between uh in front of the non-muslim doctors and they did not know what they had heard and even if he did not say it at all what counts is his work this extra whoever concludes his life with allah would enter jannah this is a bonus but so many righteous practicing muslims and companions died on their in their sleep so were they deprived from saying it will will they not enter the general no of course not so think positive of your father and more than that think positive of allah allah is most merciful lies most forgiving he would never cancel your father's good deeds just because of an incident in your head it's not in reality either it's in your head that he didn't say it how would you know he could have said it multiple times and this is something between him and allah"
