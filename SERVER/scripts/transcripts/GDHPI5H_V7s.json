  "title": "Do the Martyrs live in Jannah or Barzakh? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdul Hameed says are the martyrs living in Jannah or are they alive in the Barza and visit Jenna and come back to their graves now generally speaking we mean by martyrs are those who were killed on the battlefield while fighting the enemies of Islam yet there are different types of martyrs as mentioned in the hadith where the Prophet told the sad I saw some that the person who dies through plague is a martyr the one who a building collapses on his head the one who dies in a burning building who drowns a woman who gives birth a person who dies with a tumor in his stomach etc so these are called martyrs now they have a high status at the sight of Allah because of their patience their tolerance and because they did not complain rather they embraced a Las calamity upon them and unless testing and they did what pleases Allah so Asia so brother Abdel Hamid is asking where are they we know for sure once you die and your soul departs this world you move into a different phase so we have three phases this life this world we live in and then we have the bursa which is a transitional period between this life and the hereafter and then after the person is over we have the hereafter which is eternity it's the day of judgment that I inaugurate sit that announces it but then it is the hereafter which has no end to it so what is Al Barsha this is a life or a phase that we do not have a lot of knowledge about it is sufficient for us to know that the laws of physics time place do not apply to this life unlike this world we know you cannot walk on water and you cannot fly in air this is something we know because there are rules governing this life but in the Barza it's a whole different story and we don't have enough knowledge of it our prophet told us is awesome that on the miraculous night journey he was with the Archangel Gabriel peace be upon him and they were on this mule like creature called al Barak and they passed by the grave of Moses which was near a Red Hill and the prophet said I saw him pray and then seconds later they reached Jerusalem and then they ascended they were ascended to the heavens and he saw Moses in the fourth I think or the sixth heaven and then he came down to Jerusalem and he prayed leading all the prophets and messengers of allah azza wajal in jerusalem and among them was Moses so Moses whether it was in three different places peace be upon him but this is Alberta so coming back to your question where are the martyrs living after death people differ according to their deeds according to their status in Islam according to a number of factors some of them are in their graves I'm talking about the soul because the life of Barza you have the torment and then I am the blessing and favor of allah azzawajal and the pleasures on the soul mainly with a little of connection to the body because the body is decaying decomposing but still there is a little of connection so some are in their graves some are in green birds flying all over the Jena some of them are in a river under a green dome at the gates of Jena some of them have the ability to fly wherever they wish in paradise and to wander in paradise with a connection to their graves of course some are swimming in a river of blood and these are those who consumed usually and deal with RIBA bankers financial people of finance who make RIBA halal this is the punishment others are in a furnace of fire where fire is ignited from underneath them and they fly until they reach the top of it and then it comes down and they fall down again and this punishment is continuous so there are so many different scenarios depending on the people but generally speaking yes the martyrs they wander in Jannah some of them are hang in a lantern like in the trees of Jena getting their food and drinks and seeing the Jannah but not fully being admitted to it because this happens only on the day of judgement and so on so therefore it's a phase that we do not have a lot of information about but we know for certain that they are alive at the side of Allah and they're enjoying the life of Barza"
