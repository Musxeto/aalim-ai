  "transcript": "Salat Dhuha. To this nomad, no one knows him. What kind of a motivation it would give him when the head of the state, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, says such powerful words. Anas Ibn Malik says, a man comes to the Prophet ﷺ and is eager to go for Jihad. He wants to fight in the cause of Allah. But he's broke. He's stone broke. So he said, O Prophet of Allah, give me a camel so that I could travel and fight in the cause of Allah. So the Prophet says to him, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, we will give you a child of a camel. And the guy says, what would I do with a child of a camel, a son of a camel? This is too small to carry me to battle. And the Prophet said, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, and do she-camels give birth except to big camels? Meaning that he didn't lie, but he just pulled his legs in the sense that I'll give you a son of a camel, which is a grown up, full-fledged camel. But the man thought it was going to be a newborn camel that would not help or suffice."
