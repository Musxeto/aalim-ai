  "title": "Is it permissible to repeat Quran mistakes to correct a student | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Miriam from the UK says sometimes a teacher of Quran listens to a mistake so he has to repeat the mistake in order for the student to learn not to repeat it again is this permissible that's a yes yeah and if a person makes a mistake and I am repeating the mistake not because I want to mock the Quran or make fun of it or intentionally make an error in it out of Allah this is blasphemous but rather for the child or for the student to learn and hear his own mistake there is no problem in that insha'Allah"
