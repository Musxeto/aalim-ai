  "title": "My friend studied philosophy and went into Sufism, how to call him back to Islam",
  "transcript": "fakher says he's got a friend who studies philosophy and he ended up embracing sufism he asks how can i explain to him that what he's doing is wrong and that he's going astray i don't know your friend and i don't know how deep he's down in the in that swamp but all what i can tell you is that there is nothing that is equivalent to quran in the sunnah such people of innovation the moment you bring up the issue of biddah or the prophet did not do it or say it they get outraged i've spoken to many people who claim to be sufis not real sufis innovators and the moment you say the prophet salaam did not do this do you know more than him they explode in your face saying that not everything we do is according to what the prophet used to do and this shows you what's deep in their heart they claim to love the prophet hassam they claim to do a lot of thicker because they love the prophet haslam but their actions state that they think that they can be better than the prophet hassam no better than the prophet salaam and it's not an issue to neglect his sunna and do something he didn't do other islam so just show him quran and if there is any hope in him he will come back if not just dump him and look for some other righteous person following the sunnah to hang out with you"
