  "transcript": "the second question is is there anything special to be done on the day a woman's is over any dos and don'ts in Islam is the waiting period after a separation a divorce or the death of the husband and there is a specific period of time that a woman must wait either one monthly cycle or one month or three monthly Cycles or three months or if she's pregnant that she delivers her pregnancy or if she's not pregnant and she's a widow she has to wait for four months and 10 days different time periods so after after the is over and usually people ask about the of a widow because she usually waits for four months and 10 days not allowed to Adorn herself not allowed to leave the house and the likes so is there anything specific the answer is nothing is prescribed in the Shar so the moment her is over she can resume her normal life she can go out out she can visit relatives go to places Adorn herself without of course uh showing that to naham men wearing perfume in the house whatever she wants to do is permissible within the guidelines of the Shar but is there anything specific like throwing a party no it's a cultural thing if after finishing her period She wants to throw a party or gather her relative and feast there's no problem in that because it's a cultural thing it has nothing to do with Islam and Allah Knows Best"
