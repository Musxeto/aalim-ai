  "transcript": "Sadiqah from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh when I got my first period I don't know how to find the purity and I also don't know how to perform the measurement. So after 3 and 4 days of when I stopped bleeding for 12 hours or more than that or less than that, I thought that this is it. And if I get any brown discharges or bleeding, I thought this is nothing and I prayed like this for so long. After married, I have intercourse with my husband while having brown discharges because I'm ignorant and he's also ignorant, don't know the ruling. And after some days I come to know the ruling but I was little bit knowledgeable. So after 6 and 7 days when I started having yellow discharge or off-white discharge, I haste a lot and I try to insert tissue paper or cotton bud to check if there is anything white or not. If I see anything little white, I count it as a purity and I don't know that you must perform the measurement before having intercourse. So I also do that couple of times. Now I feel really remorse and do I need to expiate for that? First of all, Alhamdulillah Azzawajal, you live in a Muslim country. Such ignorance is not accepted. How would a Muslim live in a Muslim country? The majority are Muslims, the Imams are there and you don't know the simple basis of purity issues. This is unacceptable. Nevertheless, Alhamdulillah, Allah Azzawajal is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful. If you simply was ignorant and did not know the ruling, in this case Allah Azzawajal forgives you and Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala does not hold you accountable for such ignorance. You have to ask Allah for forgiveness, seek remorse from Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala and move on. But you have to learn your religion because this is totally unacceptable for you as a Muslimah to be ignorant in the basics of Islam. What else is it that you know about Islam? So definitely this is a major thing for you to rectify and be remorseful of and Allah knows best. Alhamdulillah."
