  "title": "Can a Muslim give a dying patient Morphine to help with the pain of death",
  "transcript": "Arik from U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sir Sheikh, my question is, in U.S. in the senior livings, there is a thing that when some of the old residents are about to die, they give them a medicine called morphine. So like what this basically does is that they believe that it reduces their pain of death and it brings them a very peace moment at the time of death. So Sheikh, if someone works as a medtech care, would it be permissible for him to apply this medicine to the residents and would his income be halal for this? Jazakallah Khair. Wa Jazakum. Morphine is a form of anesthesia which is a painkiller and it is not permissible to give to a patient or a dying person unless it was prescribed by the physician or by the doctor. Just the request of the family does not permit such pain relief substance to be given if we know that this could also lead to hallucination and intoxication. So this is totally prohibited unless it is called for and instructed by the resident physician and Allah knows best."
