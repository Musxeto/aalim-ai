  "transcript": "consider subscribing uh nasra from the U.S um so I know we're supposed to be using um timetable um for the first four prayers because the Aisha is wrong um so my question is there's a Masjid um in my city it's pretty close to my house and they post their five daily prayers on their website um so I was just wondering like can I use the first four um prayers off of um and then use Isha off of the website or Is there like another timetable that I can use okay I will answer inshallah she says that the Masjid close by to her home post on their website their prayer times so she's asking is it permissible for me to follow um when it comes to Asia I follow this message the answer is yes there's no problem in that because most likely they are following the University of Karachi in Pakistan which their timing is most likely to be accurate for Asia foreign"
