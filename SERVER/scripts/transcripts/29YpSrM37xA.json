  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam to Allah So whenever I have waswas in intention of fasting and I want to ignore it but then because before I sleep I keep on repeating in my head I want to fast tomorrow I want to fast tomorrow and then I get a doubt do you really intend it and then when I wake up in the morning I'm like did I intend to fast? Sumaiyah did you have your pre-dawn meal before going to bed? No So did you intend to wake up before Fajr Adhan to drink some water or to have a bite so that you would fast? No I generally don't eat sugar if I'm fasting outside of Ramadan This is totally against the Sunnah and it is one of the ways of warding off such whispers is to have the pre-dawn meal even if it is a sip of water as per the Hadith this is what differentiates us from the Jews and the Christians the pre-dawn meal and the later it is the better so even if you have one date or a sip of water before the Adhan of Fajr that is your intention try your level best to work on that and Inshallah you will never ever have these worries or whispers again Thank you for watching!"
