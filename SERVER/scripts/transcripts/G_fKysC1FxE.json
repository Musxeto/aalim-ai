  "title": "Do we get sins for Views or Watch Time on YouTube",
  "transcript": "[Music] so my question is um when we watch youtube videos the video that we watch that it gets a view and because of that view we gave to the video the video gets um recommended to other people um does that mean we get a sin for every person that watches the haram video because of us okay uh yeah see i think i've answered this before but my answer was maybe a little bit as usual rude so sumi what are you gonna do how is it possible that shaytan messes up with our heads and convinces us that watching a haram with you yes okay it's between me and allah but because the number of viewers will grow and it will be recommended to others oh no then i think i should not watch it yani this is exactly like and i've said this before a man who comes to the sheikh and says my girlfriend is pregnant six months or seven months old uh pregnancy and i would like to abort it because we're not married so the sheikh is saying why didn't you use condoms so to avoid getting her pregnant and the man says sheikh they told me condoms is are not permissible to use it's haram so using condoms is haram having sex with your girlfriend is halal what kind of mentality is this so it's the same fashion if you don't care about watching haram the content what you hear what you see and you are afraid that because of a number added to the 20 million viewers before your viewership that would gain some sense to you this doesn't sound valid to me you"
