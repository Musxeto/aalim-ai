  "title": "Don't Curse Time - Allah is time, can we say, I have time to kill or damn that day when I met you?",
  "transcript": "Umar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, are you familiar with the saying in English, I have some time to kill? Yep, what's the crime of time to kill it? Is it allowed to say this saying if there is a hadith that do not curse Allah for He is time? No, no, no, this is totally separate issue, Akhi. The hadith you're referring to is the hadith al-Qudsi, يؤذين ابن آدم يسب الدهر وأنا الدهر The son of Adam is insulting me or harming me. He insults time and I am time. Now, all scholars agree that time is not one of Allah's beautiful names or His attributes. However, this is to refer to the issue when someone says, damn that day I met you. It was a horrible day. It was a cursed day. Now the day has nothing to do with it. You are cursing what made you fall into meeting that person or doing that action. So you're actually insulting Allah Azza wa Jal because He is the one who preordained this upon you. Not time and not the day or the year. And therefore, when someone says, I have time to kill, He's not insulting time. It's a metaphoric phrase to indicate that I don't have anything to do. I'm just spending my time trying to make time run. So these are two separate things that Allah knows best."
