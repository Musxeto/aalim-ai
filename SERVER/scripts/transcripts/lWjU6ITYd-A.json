  "title": "Can We Make Dua By Raising Hands After Finishing Tahajjud Every Night? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and the last question is from allah he says can we make dua by raising hands at tahajjud every night after finishing salah after we are not allowed to do that but what about after tahajjud the answer is definitely yes tahajjud time is a time for dua and this is understood from the hadith where the prophet says allah whenever it is the last third of the night allah the almighty descends to the lower heavens and says is there anyone asking to give is there anyone seeking forgiveness to forgive is is there anything who has something that i would grant him etc so this is time for dua allah is asking us to make dua and because this is a time for dua so you raise your hand whether before that to hajj or after the tahajjud and make as many as you wish you"
