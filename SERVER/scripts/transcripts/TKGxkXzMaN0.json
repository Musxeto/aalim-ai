  "transcript": "Yusuf from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So my question is regarding the application called Snapchat and is it permissible to like, I have some friends of mine in school that and they're girls and I just have them as a friend, I don't chat with them. So is this permissible to have them as like a friend and they can see my location, I can see their location on the application? No, it's not permissible to have such friends of the opposite gender in any application, especially when there is a possibility somewhere down the line to get in touch or in contact, even after 20-30 years without you knowing it. Shaitan is always present, reading their storyline and they're reading yours and knowing what's happening to you, knowing what's happening to them. This is not permissible at all."
