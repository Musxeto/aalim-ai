  "transcript": "Muhammad from Pakistan so I asked you this question last week and then you said that it is not perple to bribe to your age so then she I contacted some lawyers they said that there's no other way you will have to bribe but we can do it for you and my father can do it but he'll have to use referals or contacts is that not permissible and I'm so reluctant on asking this question because there is no other way to get married because I can't use AIDS groups marriage agencies they're all 18 that's why kind find a wife that's the problem and I can't use families because they on the answer is the same I cannot tell you that bribing is halal in such conditions you have to work your way out of it not on my back I'm not going to erect myself as a bridge on top of Hellfire for you to walk on my back to safety I'm telling you bribe is Haram unless it is to do something that is halal meaning they have blocked me from receiving my goods which is I bought with my money and it's Halal and it's legal everything is kosher but they want bribe in this case I give bribe because they are transgressing but in your case you want to change your age in order to get married this is not permissible and it opens a Pandora box for more Haram you have to find out another way to do this and Allah Knows Best"
