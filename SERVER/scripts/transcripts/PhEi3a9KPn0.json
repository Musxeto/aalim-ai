  "transcript": "consider subscribing second question is from brother ahmed and he says can i just lie down when the adhan is being called because some say it is not permissible the answer is there is no problem none whatsoever in lying down in sitting in playing in even talking though some scholars say that this is not recommended so that you could repeat after the event repeating after the is a highly recommended sunnah is it mandatory no so if we are in a heated discussion and that is called and we don't stop you know are we sinful answer is no likewise if you're lying down if you're sitting if you're playing if you are eating whatever you're doing there is nothing wrong in that and the determining factor is anyone who claims otherwise must bring us evidence because the default in everything we do is permissibility till proven otherwise uh what's the ruling on wearing your watch on your right hand rather than your left it's permissible no why aren't you wearing it on your left i don't want to no you should wear it on your left what's your evidence this is the default what's the waiting on wearing such sun eyeglasses or using such pens etc everything in this world this is logical rather than also of course islamic everything is permissible everything is halal and this is known as the default until proven otherwise so when you claim that oh don't lie down the adhan is being called okay likewise i would cascade this to quran so if quran is being recited i can't lie down true the elders would say hmm yes true no it's not true the prophet islam used to lie down put his head in mother asha's lap and read the quran so you know better than the prophet isalam so there is no restriction except from the sharia from the quran and the sunnah allah knows best you"
