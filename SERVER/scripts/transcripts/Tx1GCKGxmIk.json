  "transcript": "Ayman from the Netherlands Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I have a Shia classmate and he said that it's mandatory to know and follow the 12 Imams and he also claimed that it's mentioned in the Quran that the Ahlulbayt is perfect and that we Sunnis also have a hadith that the Prophet ﷺ said follow the Ahlulbayt So what's your question? Could you please clarify this question? Akhi, there is nothing to clarify. The Shia are a negligible cult, a sect, one of the 72 sects of Islam which the Prophet ﷺ told us and there is no doubt that they are one of the 72 sects that are in hell. Only one sect will be in heaven, in paradise and those who are following the footsteps of the Prophet ﷺ are his companions. Now you tell me, are the Shia following the footsteps of the Prophet ﷺ? Even the Shia themselves they will tell you, nope, we don't, we follow the 12 Imams. We follow Abu Abdullah al-Husayn and the other Imams. But what about the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ? They don't pay attention to it. Do they follow the Sunnah of the Companions? Of course not. They say that the vast majority of the Companions are disbelievers and kafir. They slander Mother Aisha, they slander Mother Hafsa, they curse Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman and the rest of the Companions. What do you expect from them? Who in his right mind who has a glimpse of knowledge of the Qur'an or of the Hadith or of common sense would even entertain or listen to what they say? So don't even talk to such imbeciles to start with. you"
