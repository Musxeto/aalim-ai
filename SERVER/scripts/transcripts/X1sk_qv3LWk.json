  "transcript": "Abdullah from Pakistan. Ahsanallahu Alaykum. Alaykum Akhil Kareem. What can I do for you my friend? Sheikh, a person was asking that if he can use his dad's card on Apple Pay as his dad trusts him and he gets a notification whenever the payment is done, so he wants to eat as soon as possible. So is that permissible? Did you say Salamu Alaykum? Ahsanallahu Alaykum. Yes or no? No. And what did the Prophet say Alayhis Salatu Wassalam? Whoever starts questioning you before giving Salam, do not reply to him. So you want an answer to your question? Sure, but Sheikh, I heard a scholar saying that if you are already in a Dars, etc. and then you don't have to say Salam because it's already done in the beginning. So you tell me what I should do when I hear the Prophet saying Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, Man bada'akumu al-su'ala qabla al-salami fala tujibu. Should I listen to your scholar or to the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam? Sure, I will say Salam, but that's what I believe to talk from the Sheikh. Salamu Alaykum. Wa Alaykum Salam wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh. Again, this is a crossroad. Whenever the Prophet says something Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, and a scholar says something, who should we follow? I don't think this is a, I think this is a no-brainer, but when I say that no, I believe what the Sheikh said, this is a very huge problem on the Day of Judgment. How would you face the Prophet Salallahu Alaihi Wasallam and say to him, didn't I say this? Okay, maybe I misunderstood the Hadith. The Hadith is authentic, by the way. So you go back to the scholar and ask him whether there is something else to reply to this Hadith. Maybe he would say to you, well, there is an incident in Sunan Abi Dawud, where the Prophet Salallahu Alaihi Wasallam was with his companions and one after one asked him questions without giving Salam. I would say, okay, that does the job. But without that, I would be hesitant to follow the scholar without following a Hadith that is crystal clear from the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam. Besides, do you think I'm okay with Salam Alaikum every time I say Alaikum Salam, Alaikum Salam, Alaikum Salam? It would be much feasible for me to go into the question and answer without any problem. Anyhow, going back to your question, Ya Abdullah, if your father has given you or your friend his card and you use it for Apple Pay or you use it for purchasing anything else and your father gets a notification and you know that he has no objection to it and he has no problem. In this case, this is considered to be an open permission. Unlike that, unlike if you use your father's cards and buy a ticket, an airline ticket, and he sees a huge amount of number of money being used, definitely he's going to come and question you, why did you do this? Who gave you permission? So in trivial things that you know for certain that he would not object and he already knows that you had done it, this is permissible inshaAllah and Allah knows best."
