  "title": "Friday Prayer with 2 Khateebs, One Khateeb delivers Khutbah in Arabic & leads prayer, another transl",
  "transcript": "Brother Yunus from Germany. Sheikh, yesterday I asked you the question but you misunderstood me. So it was about Jumu'ah with two khateebs, you know. So I said the following, there are two men, okay. One delivers khutbah in Arabic, okay, then he sits. Then the listener stands up and delivers the translation in German, okay. Then the sitting one, so the first one stands up again, makes the second khutbah and then he's the imam for two rak'ahs. So the Arab does everything normal, just the difference is in his sitting where normally everyone is silent, someone stands up and then speaks German aloud and this is just part of their Jumu'ah. He already spoke to them, they should change it but they refused with basically no reason. I hope this is clear now. So by your correction, the khateeb of the Jumu'ah is actually giving two khutbahs of the Jumu'ah, however the innovation they have introduced is that in between the two khutbahs, a translator stands up to give a translation. Again, that is not good and this is totally against the sunnah and wrong. However, does that invalidate the khutbah or the Friday prayer? I would personally believe that it would not invalidate it because in so many incidents, while the Prophet was giving, alayhi salatu wasalam, his Friday speech, there was an interaction between him and one of the worshippers by either clarification or a request or any of that sort and the Prophet would interrupt his khutbah to listen and reply to that individual. So the prayer, inshaAllah, is valid but what they are doing is a clear innovation and it's prohibited and Allah, alayhi salatu wasalam, knows best. We have a short break, stay tuned and inshaAllah we'll be right back."
