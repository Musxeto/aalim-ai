  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, my question is what is Al-Wala Wa Al-Bara'a in a concise manner, like just a general explanation? In a concise manner, Al-Wala is to have the feeling of allegiance and belonging to Islam and to the Muslims, whether they're sinful or righteous. My allegiance is wholeheartedly given to the Muslim Ummah and to my religion, to Islam, regardless of nationality, of race, or of any other aspect. My first priority is to serve Allah Azza Wa Jal and to serve Islam and the Muslims. This is Al-Wala. Al-Bara'a is to disassociate myself with anything that is not associated with Islam. So I disassociate myself to disbelieving nations, to ideologies that don't relate to Islam, to sinful people committing sins that go against Shari'ah, whether they're Muslims or non-Muslims. So I could have both feelings of Al-Wala and Al-Bara'a to a specific individual. He's a Muslim, so he has my allegiance as a Muslim, but he's sinful, he's committing major sins, so he has my disloyalty as a sinful, openly sinful Muslim. I could love and hate the same individual, depending on the goodness and the badness in him. So this concept is mentioned clearly in the Qur'an, as in Surah Al-Mumtahina, when Allah Azza Wa Jal tells us about our role model in Ibrahim and his people. And there are many, many places in the Qur'an and the Sunnah that state this, and Allah knows best."
