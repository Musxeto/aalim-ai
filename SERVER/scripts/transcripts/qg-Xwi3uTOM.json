  "title": "Etiquette of asking questions when using Reputable scholars names | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I was reading a fatwa of Shia Hollerith Amin may Allah have mercy on his soul on a slant Q&A that if a person persists in a minor sin and that becomes his habit then it becomes a major sin because of persisting in it not because on the deed in and of itself like watching series on daily basis etc first of all part of the etiquettes of seeking knowledge is that you do not bring the names of honorable great major scholars of Islam and ask about their opinions so if this is the fatwa of shares even as a me in a reputable website as Islam Q&A and you come and ask me publicly about the validity of this fatwa it would be quite inappropriate and impolite from me to address this issue and hence I would not answer it had you asked that some scholars say insisting on doing a minor sin makes it a major sin is this true or not I would have answered you but due to the fact that you brought up the name of this great scholar of Islam share from Hama the masala Heather as I mean one of the great jurors and scholars whether he's right or wrong Who am I to answer this inappropriately publicly so it's like someone coming and to say share so when so claims that divorce when someone asked him about the fatwa over divorce he said he did not happen what do you say this is not photoshopping if a great scholar said something and you asked him you cannot go around and ask people about it until you find someone that goes against it and pick it this is cherry picking and it's not permissible for a student of knowledge totally inappropriate to hit and clash the opinion of scholars like this share beneath a mean is a reputable well-known solid scholar of Islam and I cannot answer your question just because you brought up his name"
