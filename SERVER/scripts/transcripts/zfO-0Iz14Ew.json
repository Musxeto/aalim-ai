  "transcript": "muhammad from pakistan i have a question that people call himself and they also innovate in like ravi the world called shahada so it is not innovation because these labels were not at the time of the process okay i think we've addressed this so many times saying that i don't go around people and say listen i'm a salafi i'm this i'm that what are you i'm a muslim that's it that's all what i have to say i'm a muslim but when there are many sects so there are kafir sects like whatever and they claim to be muslims uh you're a muslim yes i'm a muslim when this guy says he's a muslim no he's not a muslim he is a khadiani and what are you i am a muslim from alison al-jamaa so the term of sunnah al-jamara was introduced when these sects came claiming to be muslims so we needed an identification like nationalities what are you i'm a human being yeah i know you're a human being i don't see a tale and two long ears but what are you what's your nationality where do you come from here we have to distinguish between nationalities and countries so i say amass audi he says i'm an imarati and he says i'm an egyptian no problem but if it happens to reach the level of arrogance and pretending that i'm a salafi whatever i go no no you listen that i'm a sadafi and it becomes like a label like a party this is not permissible and allah knows best you"
