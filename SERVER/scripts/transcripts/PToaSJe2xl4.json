  "transcript": "Beverly Smith says what is or what if you have very very contract or written contract I don't know what your previous question Beverly is but a contract whether verbal or written is the same value so in managed contract if someone says I give you my daughter in marriage and I say I accept and there are two male Muslim witnesses marriage is done this verbal in buying and selling if I say I'll give you this phone for five dollars and you say I accept and you take it and now you give me the five dollars that's it or we write a contract it's more binding more authentic and it's a proof because in verbal contracts if one of the partners dealing retreats or claims that he did not sell or buy there is no proof that I can provide and he has to his obligation to swear by saying well I am telling the truth because now I'm going to the judge and I say this man sold me his car and I gave him the money and now he says no I did not receive any money and I did not sell my car so the share tells me do you have any proof like a wire transfer with the amount to the man's account said no should you have any witnesses I said no you have any written paper document this is no so I fail to present my proof this case the defendant the share goes to the defendant the judge goes to the defendant says so and so claims that he sold you or he bought you bought from you the car and gave you the money he said no he did not the chef tells them swear by Allah and this is okay I swear by Allah I did not take anything from him and I did not sell him my card end of case I failed to present the evidence to back my story he defended his reputation by swearing end of case it's over and on the day of judgment he will pay heavily for that oath he took"
