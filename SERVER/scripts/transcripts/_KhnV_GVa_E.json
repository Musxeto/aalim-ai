  "title": "Speaking while listening to Quran? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "and hamza from bosnia my question is about talking when the quran is being played i watched your videos about that on youtube but i told my mother that she should post the recitation from her laptop if she wants to engage in conversation with me because it's humiliating the quran but she doesn't care so what should i do at that moment ignore her or just talk with her and hamza from bosnia has the governor says says that speaking during the quran we know that part of respecting the quran is when it's recited and you're the one who is playing it that you listen to it so his mother always turns on the quran and sometimes she speaks and talks while the quran is playing in the background and he told her many times but she's not listening what to do for you hamza you've done your due diligence you've done your duty there's nothing for you to do more than that and there's nothing nothing wrong in you talking to her because it is not you who turned the quran on or can turn the quran off so it's like someone reading the quran next to me i don't want to listen it's my right whether to listen or not so if i speak to someone else it's not my sin there's no sin on me because he's playing the quran he's the one who's supposed to listen so i hope this answers your question you"
