  "transcript": "uh bakker from saudi so i wanted to ask what are the rights of older brother over a younger brother who has still not reached maturity well what rights do i have over him and him to me i wish not to transgress okay i will answer inshallah bakker from saudi arabia he says what are the rights of an elder brother over his younger brother he doesn't want to transgress and this is very kind of you backer and it shows that you fear allah azzawajal because rarely you will find someone nowadays asking about these rights most people act impulsively most people would slap his sister or beat up his younger brother or control them just because he's older and he says simon says stand on one feet for half an hour and don't blink what is this this is not your right now first of all the chain of command must be followed which is your father your mother then you come underneath so if your parents are there you have no right to intervene without their recommendation or advice or permission so my brother plays video games two hours a day and i don't like this and this is bad for him i agree so can i force him can i take his uh uh ps4 and and uh break it or can i um cut the cables or can i force him not to play the answer is where are your parents they're here but they're not doing anything it's none of your business you have only the power to advice now having said that again in islam the prophet said allah the chain of command is important it's he is not from among us who does not have mercy upon our youngsters and those who do not respect the elders so these are mutual rights between you and your kid brother he has to respect you and you have to have mercy on him having said that we always neglect the fact of the core of the problem why is your brother watching or playing video games why is your sister not wearing the hijab why is your relatives listening to music and watching movies these are symptomses you if you want to cure them from these symptomses must focus on the core illness so if someone has a headache or stomachache or fatigue you don't give them things that would cure their symptomses rather you would look for the illness the original disease and cure it whether it's a cancer or whether it is he's diabetic you you have to look at the core of the problem and likewise your brother if he lacks respect if he is disobedient if he is not punctual on salat if he is not studying well focus on elevating his positive sides rather than being only critical of whatever he does so whatever he does why speak in a loud voice why do you look at your mom like this why do you sit like this sit properly why aren't you dressed why is your hair not fixed when did you wash your your teeth your mouth your mouth smells why do you do this why do you do that how can he ever accept anything that you say not a single word of encouragement and this goes for the parents as well by the way we have to give positive vibes all the time so that when we criticize something or we bring their attention to something it counts it has some weight but when we always criticize nobody's going to listen to you when you beat someone once or twice it hurts if you beat him he beat him 10 or 20 times khalas it's usual that's why when we used to go to school in the in the in the last century and this is how old i am and if we made a mistake the principal would hit us with a stick on our hands so one stick during 12 years of school had an impact some of us used to be hit like 10 times 15 times a day normal he jumps the fence he smokes in the toilet he does whatever he does and if he caught red-handed they beat him up five ten times and it's nothing it has no impact so you have to be careful of this and allah knows best you"
