  "transcript": "Toot or whatever your name is. Hello, Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam. What's your name? My name is Tootwood. Okay, what can I do for you? Sheikh, I have a question. So my question is basically if a Muslim committed an act of apostasy or committed an act of kufr, or maybe, you know, even worse than that, maybe committed shirk, for example, and that person repented from these sins, would that person be saved from the internal punishment? Allah Azza Wa Jal mentioned in the Quran in so many places that those who repent from kufr or shirk, or an act of apostasy, and they return back to the fold of Islam, that all of their sins would be erased. Not only that, it would be transformed into good deeds, and Allah would exempt them from any eternal punishment or accountability on the day of judgment. Allah Azza Wa Jal"
