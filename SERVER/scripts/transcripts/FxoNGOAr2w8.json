  "transcript": "Shayan from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh At my school, I was asked to do a Juma Khutbah. But the only problem is that there's actually a masjid right next to my school. But the students in the school are like too afraid to like go or just walk like two minutes to the masjid. Why? I was asked to do this. And pretty much the only other option was that we would hold a second Juma Khutbah and I was against this. Shayan, why are they afraid to walk to the masjid? Well, not necessarily walk to the masjid, but rather like miss their classes and stuff. Okay. So, basically, if you're living in a Kafir country and the authorities or the management of your work, of your school, of your uni, would not allow you to leave class or leave their premises to go to the masjid to attend Friday Khutbah, the alternative is that you conduct a Khutbah of Friday in congregation in the same place you're in, which is the school, and you can lead and they watch and attend. There is no problem in that."
