  "transcript": "Ashiq from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam to Allah. Sheikh, should the parents who are going to marry their daughter who is Jewish be a man who is Jewish? I cannot understand the word Ashiq. Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum, can you hear me? No, I don't understand the thing. Try to call us from a clearer line Insha'Allah. Ibrahim from Guinea. Oh, we took Ibrahim already. Saad from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam to Allah. Sheikh, my question is I know that it's not permissible to be in seclusion with a woman but is it permissible for me to keep contacts with female teachers? No, if there is no legitimate reason to be in contact with a female teacher such as asking for your grades or submitting your essays or the likes, no. After graduating or at summer vacation, you just can't send them or text them, how are you, I miss you, hope to see you next year, I hope you're doing well. No, this is all uncalled for and it's not halal."
