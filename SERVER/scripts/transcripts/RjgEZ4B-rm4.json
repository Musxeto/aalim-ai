  "transcript": "Aryaan from India: How can someone be a Hafidh?\nAnswer: A Hafidh is a description   to someone who memorizes the Qur'an. How \ncan I memorize the Qur'an? There is no one   size that fits all. It differs from one person \nto the other. Some people [whom] I know,   would read one page of the Qur'an, repeat \nit 2 or 3 times and they've memorized it.   Other people need to write the page of the \nQur'an 2, 3 times and they memorize it.   Some people would need to recite it (recitation) \n50 times and they memorize it! So you must look   at what is more convenient for your memorization, \nyou have to take a friend or more to revise   to one another because doing it on your \nown - usually - is not successful, you   tend to lose steam after [a] few weeks, if not \nfew days. But when you have someone comitted   to you and with you, you will go long way In \nSha Allah. And you have to memorize a portion,   and revise a bigger portion everyday because the \nmore days pass the more you've memorized, and   there is no use of memorizing it wihtout revising \nit because it disappers very quickly and you   need to accomodate what you have memorized in \norder not to forget it. And Allah knows best."
