  "title": "Rice, Lentils, Dates, Wheat for Zakat Al Fitr? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I think we have time for Sadiqa from Bangladesh. Can we give rice or lentils as a Zakat al-Fitr? The answer is yes. It is permissible to give rice, to give lentils, to give wheat, to give dates, any staple food that the people use can be given as Zakat al-Fitr and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best. This is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow In Sha Allah same time. I'm tomorrow Thursday. Yes, I leave you. Fee amanillah, Wassalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it In Sha Allah within the following two days or three days. And by Allah's permission, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all. Allahumma wa biidhnillah."
