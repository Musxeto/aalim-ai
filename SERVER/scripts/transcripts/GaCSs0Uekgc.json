  "title": "Is it permissible to do Magic Tricks in Islam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh azan from us is it permissible to do magic tricks okay i will answer inshallah and then from the u.s he says what's the ruling on having magical tricks it's an issue of dispute whether the magic that is haram is sorcery or anything that's magical meaning scholars differed from long ago whether sorcery which is haram is the one that involves the gin black magic special special things you say or it can also include potions poisons and things that chemical have have a chemical reaction that you do to have something done so alimamma shafiri used to say that things that are chemically induced or motivated so you make something that has a chemical reaction would affect a person this is not sorcery that requires beheading an execution by the muslim ruler other scholars say no all is considered to be uh magic black magic sorcery and it's all prohibited and according to this difference of opinion scholars acknowledge the sleight of hand so if i do this and i get you a a coin or i take a flower bouquet from a hat and then take a rabbit and then i don't know what happens they said this is obvious everybody knows that this is a trick card tricks that people do there's no gin involved there's no actual magic involved it's a sleight of hand deception it's camouflaging my movement so that you don't see and i do something afterwards that would maybe astonish you this is not magic nevertheless scholars say that just to be on the safe side all of this is a package deal all is harlem but as i said there is a difference of opinion i would recommend that you stay out of it one of my grandsons does these uh magical uh card tricks and he's very good in it in his mashallah but unfortunately when you are like in 10 11 years of age you tend to act like your peers at school and and he picked it up so my advice is not to do it but would i hold a stick against him no i think that this is a magical trick i can learn no jin involved nothing is involved but it's best to be safe rather than to be sorry you don't know what the future holds for you maybe shaytan would pull his leg and say okay let's go to try a disappearing act let's try saving ourselves from a an aquarium filled with water or box filled with fire etc like they do and this would be something unadvisable and allah knows best"
