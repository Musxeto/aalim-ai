They receive a profit on a monthly basis and I need to record it I want to know that if I am sinful in recording it or should I leave my job a Musharaka account Bilal a Musharaka account is something that is Islamic if it is actual Musharaka so Musharaka or Mudaraba has almost the same meaning if they put it in a Musharaka where the bank utilizes the money and works in business and real estate and selling commodities and at the end of the year they divide the profit according to those who participated or sharaku in this Musharaka, in this Mudaraba but if there is there are any losses they would also share the losses with the participant this is halal and you can work there without a problem Inshallah"
