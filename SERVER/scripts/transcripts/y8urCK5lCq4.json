  "title": "Particles of food left in the mouth while fasting | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hallet says after suhoor and so who is the pre-dawn meal I slept and felt there is some dates left on my teeth while sleeping I felt a taste of dates and I swallowed my saliva I feel there was no dates particles in my saliva when I swallowed but however when it I felt the taste I did not get up since I was lazy to get up in between my sleep after I woke up and I rinsed my mouth I found some small particles of dates does this break my fast first of all fasting is between you and Allah I can give you an answer based on what I have read which might not be the right answer because you formulated the question in a way that you would get my answer I'm not sinful for that it's on you because this is between you and Allah as OSHA so the rule is if you're certain that you swallowed something your fasting is invalid if you're not certain the fasting is valid if you only found the taste without any particles the taste does not affect your fasting so now that you know the probabilities and the different scenarios you are the only one who can judge because now you're saying that I was in between sleep I was lazy so if you did it unintentionally you did not have your sound mind with you then there is no accountability on you but no one can answer this except you it's between you and Allah and if you're doubtful make up for that day"
