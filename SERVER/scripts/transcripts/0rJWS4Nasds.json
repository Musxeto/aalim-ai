  "title": "Did Imam Ahmad say Iman 'Whoever says iman is created then he is a disbeliever'",
  "transcript": "uh first question is from rashad from tunisia he says that he quotes that imam says whoever says iman is created then he is a disbeliever and he is whoever says it's not created then he is a an innovator i personally don't know anything about this so i cannot say that muhammad said such such thing and i i don't have knowledge in it therefore i will not uh comment on it we have to first verify that imam had said it secondly we would have to know what exactly was meant by it most likely because the self did never spoke about iman and you cannot say that it is created or not created but at the same time it is a little bit too ambiguous if it's not created then it has to be it has to deal with allah azzawajal but we know that it is not part of allah's attributes so what do you mean it's not created so i have my doubts whether this is authentic related to imam ahmed is it iman um generally speaking or is it about specific thing therefore i don't have any uh comment on it i have my doubts whether this is authentic or not you"
