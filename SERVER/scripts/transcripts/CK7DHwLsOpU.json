  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam wa rahmatullah. What is the reward of praying two rak'ahs at Quba Mosque or Masjid al-Quba? Jazakallah khairan. Wa jazakum. The Prophet ï·º, if I'm not mistaken, used to go every Saturday walk to Quba Masjid and to pray two rak'ahs there. In the authentic hadith, prayer of two rak'ahs in Quba Masjid is equivalent to performing a Umrah. So it is highly recommended whenever you're in Medina to visit Quba and to pray two rak'ahs there."
