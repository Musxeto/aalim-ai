  "title": "Can we keep the extra money if court grants us, in the cheque bounce case",
  "transcript": "sakip says in a check but if a check bounces or in a check bounce case if the court forces my debitor to pay more than what he owes me as a punishment would it be permissible for me to take this additional money what you are entitled for is what you had lent anything extra would be considered as the RIBA this Court is not Islamic and hence they do not have the power to cross the line so even if they gave you and sentenced him to pay you more than the actual loan you should take the extra and give it back to him and Allah knows best"
