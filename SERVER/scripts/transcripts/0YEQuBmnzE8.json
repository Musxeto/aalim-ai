  "title": "Goes to a Hindu School where they do Bhajans & Om Mantras, what to do if parents force him to stay?",
  "transcript": "i did not understand the question is i go to a school where they do bhajans every thursday and they say ram's name instead of good morning and before every class starts they do something like home for two minutes so going to the school is permissible but now i am in 10 standard so my parents are not letting me to leave this the school due to education so what should i do here if i understand your question you go to a hindu school and they impose upon you every thursday that you engage in some sort of mourning prayers that is usually practiced by doing yoga or praising ram or saying um and and whatever these kuffer practices may entail so what's the ruling on that number one it is totally prohibited for you to participate and if you're forced to participate the best thing to do is to leave the school and do homeschooling or better more go to a school that is an islamic school if this is not possible then homeschooling would be your best option if this is again not possible you can be there but hate it with your heart and not participate in whatever they do so be there physically but don't say or endorse or like what they do because you are in a kafir country and these are practicing their own religions and you must not join them and allah knows best you"
