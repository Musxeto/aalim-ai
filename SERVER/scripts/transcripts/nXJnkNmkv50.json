  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden alikum allum Salam I have this confusion that whenever I join if I ever join the Salah late and I join like when the IM is in the first and then by the time I get down then after like two or three seconds he goes up am I supposed to like go up with him because then I'll be omitting a w act like intentionally uh the whole the whole ra is omit wasn't it is it valid no so it's no problem if you just sit down for a couple of seconds and you say and he says allahar you move on and move on normally because at the end of the day you're going to make up to rakas afterwards regardless whether you finish your tah or you didn't so don't worry about this"
