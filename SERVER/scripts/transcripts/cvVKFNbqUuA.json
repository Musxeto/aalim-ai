  "title": "Using ones intellect over the Quran & Sunnah? ðŸ¤” assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "um my parents they say that when i told them like a hadith like something like if the religion was based on intellect then the bottom of the sock would be more worthy of wiping than the top they and they mostly they use intellect they keep saying that in the quran allah keeps telling us to like use our intellect and uh look around and things like this and um how do i answer this like to use like how do i answer the fact that they say he's intellectual what what they said is quite true this is definitely right the quran encourages us to ponder and to think and to implement our head in asking and learning and but you have to be careful not to follow the footsteps of satan because satan when commanded by allah to prostrate to adam he used his intellect and said this doesn't make any sense i am better than adam you created him from clay and i am was created from fire so i am better why would i prostrate to him so he rejected and refused to comply with allah's order by his intellect which led him to be eternally in hell fire forever now you tell your parents is your intellect doing the same thing with a straightforward command of allah in the quran and in the authentic sunnah if yes well you might need to reserve a seat with satan in hell because you're in deep poop unfortunately but you as a muslim have to strike the balance your compliance your submission as islam is the religion of submitting your will to allah your submission should be only to the quran and to the sunnah no questions asked and i always give this example when a disbeliever asks you about the beauty of your religion and how you pray five times a day and how you wash three times your limbs your face your arms and your feet for each prayer and this is mostly 15 times you wash your feet a day minimum and he as a disbeliever doesn't wash his face except once in the morning so your feet are more purer and cleaner than his face so this disbeliever is in shock and and and he's amazed by the beauty of your religion and the purity and the clear cleanliness in it then he asks you if we don't have water what should we do you proudly say we strike the soil once and we wipe our faces and hands and he said you wipe your face with soil why would you do that what would your parents say if they reject this they're apostates they're disbelievers because this is mentioned twice in the quran and i don't think they would reject it but unfortunately they're argumentive they're trying to refute some of your ideas which they don't like by bringing up the issue of intellect and thinking and pondering and this is a very dangerous game there playing and allah knows best you"
