  "title": "Praying in a Room with Pictures, VALID? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We have Talha from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Fathah. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. My question is that in my school, I pray my Salat by Zuhur and my Zuhur Sunnah in my school. My question is that because in my school year, the prayer room, it has like pictures of like humans and stuff like that. And also like next to the prayer room is the women's section. So it's like on the other room, like next to, on the side. So I'm not sure. And if I don't pray there, I'm going to miss my Zuhur. So can I pray my Zuhur Salat and my Zuhur Sunnah in there? The prayer in a room where there are images, whether portraits or statues, is not recommended. However, the prayer itself is valid. So if there is no other place or no other option for you to pray, then yes, you may pray there without any problem. Inshallah. And Allah Azawajal knows best."
