  "title": "Should I contribute to the free mixing & cracking jokes by answering the teacher's questions?",
  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Please let me finish, this is a completely new question. So in Germany, classes work the following way. The teacher explains something and it's very interactive. So he's constantly asking questions to the students. And what happens is, the teacher makes jokes with the students, or the students crack jokes with one another. And I go to a mixed school. Now the thing is, if the content is completely fine, like it's just math, then what happens is, if I answer the teacher's questions, and my answer is correct, I will make the discussion go faster, I will make the discussion go smoother, and I will make them crack more jokes. So if I myself am modest, can I then answer the teacher's questions? This has nothing to do with you, Yunus. Whatever they do as a consequence, this has nothing to do with you. You answer the question correctly and smoothly, and if they take off their clothes, this is not your problem. Just don't crack jokes and don't involve with them in their haram activities. Answer the question as you were asked and move on. Thank you."
