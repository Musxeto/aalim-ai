  "transcript": "Khan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. My question is regarding raising hands or rafawli adain while doing going to sujood or between two sujoods. Is the hadith authentic and if someone does this once in a while would it be an innovation? JazakAllah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. The majority of scholars say that this hadith is not authentic and the most authentic hadith is the one narrated by Imam Al-Bukhari, reported by Imam Al-Bukhari which Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, narrates that the Prophet ï·º used to raise his hands during Salat in three or four locations. One is Takbirat-ul-Ihram, the second is when you go for ruku' the third is when you raise your head from ruku' to the standing position and the fourth is when you stand from the first shahood to the third rak'ah. So these are the four places where it is authentic. Other hadiths that say that he used to raise his hands wherever he goes down and rises up, the scholars said that this is not authentic and the description was wrong, it's not he used to raise his hands rather he used to give takbir. So yes when you go for sujood and rise up for sujood you say Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar but you don't raise your hands so you don't do it even once and Allah knows best. you"
