  "transcript": "my shift at work is from 8: to 5: but I finish and come home at 3:00 p.m 2 hours earlier I do make sure my work is completed before coming home is my income Halal if I finish my work and come home early this depends on the policy and procedure of your company some companies are task oriented so they say to you today you have to finish this lumpsum of work you go from 9 to 5 if you finish it in 3 hours by 12:00 you go to your boss and says I finished it he says go home you've done your job for today this happens for example at schools in schools you have to work from 7:00 till 2:00 if your school timetable says that on Mondays you work the first three classes which means that you finish by 10 what should I do in the rest of the day most Headmaster say go home you you don't have any classes to teach we don't need you to as a walk-in teacher everything is fine so what's the point of you sitting on your desk doing nothing go home if you don't have any office hours or homework to correct leave other companies say no we pay you not for the tasks you do rather for the time you spend so we want you to sit eight hours from 9 to 5: on your desk whether you have work or not we just want you physically to be there in this case you must not leave your work and Allah Knows Best"
