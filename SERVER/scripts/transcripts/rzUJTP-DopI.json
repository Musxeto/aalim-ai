  "transcript": "Bessan from Jordan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, the sister of my husband is sitting with my babies while I am at work. She doesn't care about some important things in Islam such as listening to music and making my daughters afraid from hellfire. Sometimes humiliation for my daughters and her indecent dressing. Every time I warn her, she returns. And my husband likes this. And I couldn't put her in the nursery because nurseries in our town is not safe. So what should I do Sheikh? Thank you. You should resign your job and sit with your children because this is your role in life. To take care of your husband and your children. Not to work and get money. So if you are forced to work and you have a legitimate reason for working and Allah Azza Wa Jal will pardon you for this, in this case you have to compromise the religion of your children. And you have to choose whether to put them in the nursery or to assign them and hand them out to your sister-in-law. And Allah knows best."
