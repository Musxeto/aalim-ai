  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the US so um I asked you a \nsimilar question before but you didn't quite   answer the question exactly so I'm gonna try to \nbe more detailed uh so bear with me so I heard   you say something like a najaasa transfers if you \nhave wet hands and it also in najaasa is also not   purified over time so my question is what exactly \nis the extent of the transfer of najaasa is there   like a rule that states that najaasa doesn't \ntransfer after the second or third object because   usually typically speaking if you have urine and \nif it's just like one drop not a huge amount and   you touch for example the doorknob um and then \nyou have wet hands and you touch the doorknob   typically speaking you won't see any traces of \nnajaasa on your hand after you touch the doorknob   um the second time so um if I feel like we said \nthat najaasa transfers every single time you have   wet hands I feel like there would be hardship in \nthat so what is the exact transfer of it again   we're back to the same old kind of worms you guys \nI don't know where you get these kind of worms I   know when you go fishing you buy these worms \nto fish with but it is spreading like hayfire   among the people these Whispers and unfortunately \nwe don't have enough time that we have to wrap   it up basically speaking it all comes to \nknowledge if you have a drop of urine on   the doorknob do you see it are you certain of \nits presence the answer is yes I'm 100 certain   it's not doubtful so if you touch it with wet \nhands it transfers the najasa into your hand   okay how many times can I touch it before it \ngoes why didn't you wipe it up in the first time   so all of these hypothetical issues cause you to \nhave a ripple effect that would destroy your Imaan   and confuse you even further and further it's like \na rabbit hole that you go in you don't know when   it's going to end my advice to you is to learn \nabout issues of Purity from the authentic books   you can do that through on my YouTube channel and \nother Scholars also have done this extensively   why because a drop of urine is not coronavirus it \ncannot spread all over the place and contaminate   the carpet it contaminates the the doorknob and \nthe light switches and the kitchen utensils over   what you will find in the hanafi school of \nthought that negligible amount of impurity   Is Forgiven and this is adopted by Sheikh Al \nIslam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Uthaymeen if you   don't know your religion you think logically \nokay one drop would do this would mix with   that and the whole thing is contaminating the \nhouse so I should burn the house to the ground   to just get relieved from these Whispers \nthis is nonsense so it's not looked upon   the way you're doing because it's all based on \nspeculations and conclusions that are not based   on authentic knowledge probabilities what if what \nif this is not how it works and Allah Knows Best"
