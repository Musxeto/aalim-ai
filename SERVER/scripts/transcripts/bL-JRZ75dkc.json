  "transcript": "is it from the sunnah to do circumcision on the seventh day what are the sunnah to be done when a baby is born male circumcision is mandatory when should it be done is an issue of dispute among scholars some say when the child is 14 years of age when he reaches age of puberty some say when he's one year old some say when he's seven etc is it from the sunnah to do it on the seventh day the answer is no imam ahmad and other scholars say that there is nothing authentic to back this up so it's open to the judgment of the physician and of the parents when to make it i prefer to make it as soon as possible so that the child the infant would not feel the pain as if it were to be done to be done when he's 14 years of age for example but again this is up to the medical discretion and their preference alongside with the family uh what are the sunnahs to be done there are a number of sunnahs so in the beginning as soon as the child is born technique is a sunnah where a righteous person or the parents or anyone would eat a very tiny small piece of date and shoe it until it's almost moist and then take it and put it in the ceiling of the child's mouth and this has medical benefits uh uh so many and this was done by the prophet alistair two on the seventh day the sunnah is to name the child the sunnah is to shave the head's child uh hair and to weigh it in silver and give the equivalent in charity of that weight and silver and to slaughter two rams for a male child and one ram for a female child and as i said it's the sunnah to give the child a name on the seventh if you give the name on the first there's no problem at all but this was done by the prophet assam and he indicated that and allah azzawajal knows best you"
