  "transcript": "Yasir from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum My question is, if a person is ill and the air conditioner in the masjid increases his illness, can he pray at home? I asked an imam, he told me to pray in the corridor of the masjid and attend the jamaat. Though the jamaat doesn't reach at corridor. I felt problem in this when I miss one or two raqa as I cannot see the ongoing prayer. What to do in this case? Alhamdulillah, Allah Azza Wa Jal has not burdened us in religion. So whenever there is harm or a delay in recovery from an illness, Islam gives you the concession to avoid what does such harm or delay. So if this is the case, as it is prevalent in some masjids that the air conditioning is too cold, and if you have an illness that can progress, can increase because of such coldness, then you are exempted from praying in the masjid. Wa lillahi l-hamdu wa l-fadlu wa l-minna."
