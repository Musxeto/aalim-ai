  "title": "Length of Hair for Men | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "confusion in regards to the length of the hair of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and the hadith we're imitating the opposite gender draws Allah's curse upon the person so he says how can we reconcile there's no problem the Arabs long ago and still do in some tribes consider growing the hair and maybe braiding it part of being brave and cavalier parts of being a macho man so at the time of the Prophet asana the norm was that they used to prolong their hair and that was not considered to be imitating women because because they had long beard and they had big biceps and they were strong and they were men they used to fight in battle and they used to be real men 360 unlike today so the Prophet s salams hair was this long that used to reach his ear or a little bit to the shoulder level and this was the norm and there's no problem in that nowadays if I see a punk growing his hair and maybe tying it to a ribbon or putting something over his head I don't know what they call it and and this is definitely either to either one of the two either he is imitating women and you can tell by how soft he is or he is imitating the kafirs the disbelievers because the Muslims don't do this nowadays so it depends on the customs if he's living among his tribe and all tribesmen are having long hair there's no problem in doing that at all"
