  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, I just have a small question. Whenever I read Surah Haqqa or Surah Waqia, these two surahs, whenever I read them I start crying. So because I just, like it feels, because I feel a little bit more connected to it. So is it permissible that whenever I lead the prayer, most of the times in the school or in the uni, can I skip, personally choose to not read these prayers, read these surahs in the salah because of the fear of starting to cry or getting emotional during the recitation? Because the thoughts of Riyadh then come, so can I personally choose to not read them? JazakAllah Khair. Yes, of course. You can totally skip these surahs and read anything that would not expose you or bring thoughts of Riyadh or praise of people because this is one of the steps of shaitan. Alhamdulillah there are 112 other surahs that you can read without any problem."
