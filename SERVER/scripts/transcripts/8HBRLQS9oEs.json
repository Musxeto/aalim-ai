  "title": "Will a woman receive same reward if she goes early to Jummah, even though jummah is not wajib 4 her?",
  "transcript": "Sumeyya from France Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh For example, those who go very early for Jummah prayer, they will receive the reward of sacrificing a camel and it goes on. So, if I go to Jummah prayer and attend it, will I receive the same reward like if I go earlier or not? The Hadith of the Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, is general, with the exception of the phrase where he says, and he comes close to the Imam and listens. A woman can't come close to the Imam, rather her position as far as possible from men is more recommended and rewardable. So, the Hadith in general is general. However, with all this reward that you're talking about, when you come to the Prophet's Hadith saying that a woman's prayer in her home is better than her prayer in my masjid with me, and a woman following suit, a woman who prays in her home, Zuhur, is more rewarded than her, and Allah knows best."
