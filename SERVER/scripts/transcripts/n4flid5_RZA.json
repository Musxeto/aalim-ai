  "transcript": "helmut says is it authentic that if you do one voluntary fast for the sake of Allah you will be seventy years away from Hellfire the answer is yes then he says then can we do the math by saying that if you do mandated it fast for the sake of Allah the reward will be 70 times which is 49 thousand years away from that this is wrong you do not work things out like this the hadith you're referring to that the fault is multiplied 70 times in Ramadhan is not authentic so the full concept is wrong and it is dangerous for you to start to calculate how much Allah will reward you because if you calculate then Allah will calculate against you how much you should have done to compensate for the reward and blessing of the site of your hearing of your health of your feet of whatever Allah has given you and this is pretty dangerous"
