  "transcript": "hopefully with us online is dr a dear brother a beloved friend and one of the people we look up to a great scholar and a wise man who we seek knowledge and wisdom from here with us all the way in sha allah from riyadh hopefully if not from mecca if not from medina as he is a frequent traveler with us to share his thoughts about this beautiful event that comes once every year after the month of ramadan allah accepts from you and us the deeds that we have presented prayers fastings dua and everything else what do you have to share with us about this beautiful event that we are about to witness in sha allah and i think the introduction you made today [Music] really applies to you rather than me you are not supposed to to hear it it was supposed to not to be heard by you i didn't i didn't hear it i apologize but but uh let me let you say and congratulations to all muslims uh on this great event on this occasion and obviously i think we're all so thrilled to receive this occasion and to witness by the grace of allah all what is normally done on the day of let me remind myself and all the brothers and sisters who are watching right now that i need means something that comes time after time so it is from yarudu coming up time after time and as you already uh said in your introduction that eighth comes only once a year yes there are two or eight in islam and they're all they both came who are sorry they both come after great events comes after ramadan and in particular the last 10 days of ramadan where there is laylatul which is greater than a thousand south thousand months in in terms of honor in terms of rewards in terms of uh uh blessing by the grace of allah also eager comes after 10 days or in you know on the uh completion of the 10 days of this and these 10 days are the best days of time ever so subhanallah it reminds you that you are so immersed in ibadah while you are an aide sometimes the idea comes to mind that which is a time of celebration and joy is just to feel free and and uh not tied to to anything you can you can uh do anything you want you can go back to uh whatever you were doing before evada while you were in these uh days before eve you're so much engaged in ibadah so i think this is a reminder for us that's why we we start on the day of eight by offering salah today and then we listen to khutbah and uh stay uh on the same path that we we uh we were practicing before eight it's it's a reminder for us uh but in the meantime of course is a time for joy a time for uh strengthening relationships with uh your your family your parents that they are still alive uh and and uh your children your relatives um even your uh you know the people that you have you have ties with of any kind and then at the same time of course to show the happiness and the greatness of the day of ease showing all muslims masha'allah being praying together filling the streets dressing in the best [Music] you know uh uh dress dresses they they uh they would have um so all of these things uh come on the day of hate and i i think we can we can we can say so much about the meaning of eight if i may interrupt you now we know that all nations celebrate their own feasts whether it's religiously like christmas uh new well not new year's uh easter and and the likes or if it is something related to their worldly affairs such as the beginning of the year or a new season or the independence day etc so they all have their feasts but when we come to speak about our aids is the concept of reid related to religion or is just a cultural thing well that's that's that's the point uh obviously it's so uh clear that in islam you are in fact affirming the religiosity if you will of faith by offering the salah in the beginning by uh all three defending hands of generosity uh to to muslims around you to really uh visit those that kantan has passed without seeing them it is time to visit them it is time to renew your relationships with uh with your developers and in particular into to the muslim community to your neighbors to uh uh people that you you remember uh on the day of faith so it has a strong meaning it is so tied to the concept of the worship of allah that's why i see that the real joy on the day of eid is for those who have done well in the preceding days of aid you know uh if you do well in ramadan if you did well on ramadan then obviously you would enjoy uh the day of uh if you uh did well uh preceding the uh the day of uh like in the in the uh first ten days of the headset then obviously you're really enjoying you deserve you deserve the celebration you see in the hadith uh the angel would come uh uh sitting on the on the doors of uh of masjid or the gathering place of musa on the day of and they would distribute prices so this is the day of distributing prizes what are these prizes for just like we are getting gifts and and you know uh children are get so happy when they uh receive prizes uh and uh and gifts from from their parents or uh elders well we are just like uh having the same concept same idea but we don't see it but we feel it and uh we should have it in mind that people on the day of haiti in fact get prizes so you'd be wondering who's who's the winner on the day of eight after you did well one other concept check out if i may yes sir regarding the uh uh celebration of aids some people think that they can get out of the normal they can go and and and do whatever that they like and they if they stopped uh listening to music for example if they did not mix uh like uh having men and women uh uh on in in the same place who are not uh maharan to them then you know on the day afraid to say well well take it easy it's a day for english to say celebration even if somebody keeps his beard during some time and then finally on the day of read they go and shake their their beards saying that we need to look nice well you look nice when you're on the worship of elijah remember that you need to enjoy what has been given to you by allah and there are so many good things in life there are so many good things to to enjoy and celebrate not but by you know disobedience but rather by obedience to allah yeah i wish we could have a longer session with you because seven minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes is not sufficient we need to dedicate more and more for these powerful messages but if i make summarize what you've said is the day of eight is not the day you are set off your prison so it is not that you were in a whole month of ramadan imprisoned and now on the day of eid everything becomes halal you go rogue you go uh do whatever you want of sins no this is the result of your tests if you manage to maintain the piety and righteousness you succeeded in maintaining in ramadan afterwards this means that allah has accepted you if not then may allah am i observing it correctly yes indeed indeed and uh you know there's a famous saying of ourselves [Music] you accepted then you continue with the good deeds and if they're uh turned down rejected they're not accepted then actually you get involved in uh misdeeds so that's why we always need to keep on the same track but at the same time enjoy the celebration know that uh you glorify allah under their faith you enjoy relations you you do not eat it's prohibited for you to fast on the day of eight because it's a day of celebration the day of enjoyment the day of eating and enjoying with the family uh the community and the whole muslim allah for these beneficial and wise words and i pray to allah azzawajal that he makes you myself and our viewers steadfast on doing good deeds till the day we die and we meet him subhanahu wa'ta'ala when he is pleased with us may allah make this a blessed aid upon you your honored family and loved ones and the entire muslim ummah and hope to see you safe and sound and well soon be it allah"
