  "transcript": "foreign [Music] so although I'm well aware of it but when it comes like when it comes to a person paying off the paintings they can't go for the previous years now multiple school is told me to calculate only with the current rate of gold and the reasons received from them were that I won't be fulfilling the right of the poor because what he could have bought in the same amount earlier today he can't buy anything in the same amount and you didn't give it at the earlier time when he could have suffice for himself and you were giving it now so today's value would be considered only like even Dr Salah said so and I also heard that it would be unjust to the right of a life I don't do that my question is to fulfill my responsibility of making sure I followed the right opinion please let me know if I still choose to give with the present read would I be sitting because someone said to me it would be like following the principle of Interest which is like the time value of money I just want to know of why taking previous trade as you've guided early in your videos is just to find the light of corn and so now with a reference or evidence against the reasoning of other Scholars which are shakes from of these and if I still choose to go with the current weight even though it would cause a lot of delay is it still following the principle of interest in any way would I be going like out of the range by giving a huge amount difference and is that cruelty on will in anywhere because I was earlier okay let me interrupt you because I think you have a thesis to explain first of all do whatever you want why are you coming to me if you're a student of knowledge and you want the evidence from the Quran and from the Sunnah pertaining to the decision you have said where Muhammad Salah and other Mufti said otherwise go and follow them if you have your own brains and you have your sufficient amount of knowledge go and follow them but if you keep on cherry picking and going from Tom to dick and to Harry and then you become confused and you want to confuse others and you will find that this is not dragging to 30 years that your mom did not pay there's a cat it will go for another 20 years more stop playing around stop wasting your time and my time and everybody's else time zakat was due in 1990 the Mount of zakachi your mom should have paid was a hundred dollars this is a debt now you want to calculate this zakat of 1990 with the value of today she has to pay probably a thousand and two hundred dollars be my guest what would I care but the debt is a hundred dollars for 1990. and the amount is still the same now you go and ask whoever you want and whatever you feel comfortable with be my guest but I beg you don't come back again and again and again because this is becoming frustrating and it's a waste of time you choose whatever you want at the end of the day it's you and Allah it's your mom and Allah and you'll deal with him so I gave you my opinion my opinion is still the same it's not gonna change I'm not gonna budge so do whatever you want and Allah Knows Best uh [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign"
