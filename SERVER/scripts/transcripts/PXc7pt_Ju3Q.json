  "title": "Walking / Passing by a person who is Praying | Sheikh Assim Al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Manesh says can I walk in front of a person who's praying I see people do this in the Masjid first of all the prophet alayhi salaatu son instructed those who are praying on their own to pray to a sutra a visor a screen something that is a foot long clearance from the ground that is in front of you so that anyone who sees this knows that you are in prayer and he does not cross between you and that object you have placed in front of you they must cross from beyond it this is the instruction of the Prophet s of Salaam and some scholars even went further to make it an obligation like shekel albani and his students the majority of scholars say that this is recommended but it is not obligatory and this is the most authentic opinion but it doesn't mean that if in a vast and big area of the message I just stand up in the middle of it and pray without anything in front of me you can put a box of tissues you can put you can put a special stand for the Quran for example to pray to you can pray to a pillar of the Masjid you can pray to someone who's sitting down making Vicker and consider him to be your skiing advisor this is the Sunnah but if you don't do this you're not sinful now for me to pass in front of you if you don't pray to something like a visor it is permissible for me to cross in front of you providing I do not violate the space between your feet and the position will you place your head when prostrating if I move like 30 or 40 centimetres away from the position of your prostration I'm in the clear and I have no sin on that and you're the one who's wrong for not praying to a Sutra or to vizor analyzer knows best"
