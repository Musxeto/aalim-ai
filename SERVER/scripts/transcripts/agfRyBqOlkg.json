  "transcript": "Likewise, anyone who comes nowadays to call \nthe Muslims for similar feuds, whether he's   calling others for communism, socialism, \nor being liberal, or being a capitalist,   any calls that go against Islam, such as \nthe call of equality, feminism, liberty,   all of this is against Islam, not that Islam \nopposes freedom, no, but what kind of freedom   are you hinting, oh the freedom for a man to walk \nnaked or a woman to take off her hijab, this is   not freedom, this is transgression against Islam, \nagainst the teachings and the commands of Allah   and this is abolished and cancelled and \nunderneath the feet of the Prophet ﷺ."
