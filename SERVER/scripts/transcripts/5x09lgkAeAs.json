  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So, I take some time in the bathroom, sometimes 35 minutes, sometimes 30 When I have a problem, 40 or maybe an hour My dad's policy is, if you take too long, I'm going to prevent you from, I'm going to just drag you out Now, in Fajr time, because my father locked all the showers, it's really hard to do ghusl And sometimes he makes it impossible, you know, he just turns off the water And then, the only way I could still do ghusl would be if I go around at 5.30 in the village and ask random people Knock on their doors, can I take a shower at your house? Can I do it in such a situation, in order not to be humiliated, or must I take the embarrassment? No, you have to stop this nonsense that is causing your father to drag you out of the bathroom Taking 30 minutes or 40 minutes in the toilet is not normal So, your abnormality and your mental state of mind has to change And we're not going to change the Sharia laws to fit you Rather, you have to change and accommodate the Sharia law So, you have to stop this whispers of Shaytan, because you've tarnished the reputation of Islam And you've caused your parents to hate Islam and think that this is what extremism is And this is what happens when you follow Qur'an and Sunnah When it's not the fault of Qur'an and Sunnah, it's rather your sick mentality that is causing you all these whispers And you're opening the door for Shaytan and inviting him in to mess up with your head So, you have to change in order to adapt to the laws of Sharia"
