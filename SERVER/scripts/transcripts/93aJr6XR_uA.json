  "title": "Sign of Hypocrisy when you approve Haram",
  "transcript": "Nowadays, we see vice and evil things happening all around us, in our own homes, in the streets, in the malls. We see haram being committed, the mixing of men and women, the music, the entertainment. All of this is something that Allah Azza wa Jal hates and the Prophet ï·º hates. And it's a sign of hypocrisy not to hate it. When you feel that, whoa, this is cool, this is fun, I'm enjoying myself, and you don't see any signs of hatred on your face to such sinful acts, in this case, this is a huge sign of hypocrisy. May Allah Azza wa Jal make us among those who enforce and enjoy virtue and righteousness among the Muslims."
