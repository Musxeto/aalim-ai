  "transcript": "Ibraheem from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, how can a Muslim begin to seek knowledge? Is it by starting with the memorization of the Quran? Is it by fiqh? Is it by aqeedah? JazakAllah Sheikh Wa Jazak Akhi, it's not one size that fits all. Your fingers are different. Your mood is different. Sometimes you have this power, enthusiasm to go full force and full speed ahead. Sometimes you feel a little bit down. So it all depends on what you're lacking. Sometimes I find people with strong aqeedah, I say to them focus on memorizing the Quran and learning the tafseer. Sometimes their aqeedah is way below average. So we say to them start with aqeedah. Know the beautiful names of Allah. Know the types of tawheed. Know what are the pillars of iman. Know the signs of the day of judgment, minor and major, hell and heaven, grave, torment, and the likes. Sometimes they are highly decorated achieving students. So I say okay go to learning Arabic and take small courses of fiqh so that the basics are done such as knowing how to pray, how to fast, how to make wudu. The basics. And sometimes we say to them that you need to enroll in a course that would benefit you and give you what you really need such as Zad Academy. And I've said this before. So Zad Academy is a very suitable platform to learn your religion from trusted sources and it gives it to you nicely and beautifully as you want. When you're down you need to recreate yourself by reading the seerah, the biography of the Prophet, how he treated all those around him, the events in his life. This refreshes you and gives you strength and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
