  "transcript": "a from India when I make Dua I should praise Allah using quranic verses I can say the first verse of Surah alah or the first verse of Surah Al Fat I can say these verses multiple times and then I do and then I say then I make du each Dua three times and then I do the repeat the Praises of Allah again and then durud again and that's it right or can I do this process if I'm junob or if I in a state of impurity this is my question the answer is yes you can do this process if you are in the state of impurity whether it's major or minor however praising Allah always with the beginning ofah or Al is not from the Sunnah it is permissible and you don't have to conclude ude your Dua with that process as well you can just simply end your Dua or say Muhammad and that is sufficient"
