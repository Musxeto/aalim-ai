  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Canada my question is I live \nin a western country and I don't have any family   relatives with me I was looking to find a wife \nor get married however there's a lot of cultural   cultural barriers here so I was wondering if using \nMuslim apps or websites to meet a potential spouse   is permissible although I saw one of your videos \nmentioning that it is not a permissible to upload   photos or photographs however some women do \nI was wondering if that is still permissible   otherwise if it's not um what would be the \nbest ways to or steps to take to meet someone the issue of getting married is a very sensitive \nissue you cannot just pick any uh random woman who   claims to be hijabi or a nekabi and committed \nto Islam and you buy whatever she's selling   so websites that post photos \nof women are an Islamic   and unfortunately I've heard this and and \nthey say that this is prevailing in the West   that they conduct like a workshop where women \nwould sit on one side of the table and men would   sit on the other side of the table and they \nmeet and chit chat for like 15 20 minutes and   then they change places with another man and \nwhat is this a blind date or this is totally   unislamic and they conduct this in the message \nthey say and it's all supervised this is all Haram   and some of them conferences annual conferences \nwhere they get men and women sitting together and   when you talk to the organizers they say oh Dr \nso-and-so approved the Sheikh so said it's okay   and they're free mixing what are you doing is this \nrelated to Snapchat they have to see one another   how are they going to get married how they how \nare they going to know one another okay take it   for a test drive as well why don't you take her \nfor a date a blind date maybe just have a dinner   and my place are yours this is not Islam what are \nyou doing you're not related to Islam you're so uh   watering down your beliefs and religion you're not \nrelated to Quran Sunnah anymore that's why this is   not Islam that you're practicing or preaching or \ncalling people to this is a new religion might as   well get a woman to lead you for prayer and maybe \nget someone who's in an atheist or a Christian to   give you a Friday sermon shifted to Thursday it's \nmore convenient Friday we have a football match   what is this so these places and websites stay \naway from them posting your picture as a man   is no problem a woman posting her picture she is \nnot a house she's not a wife material just don't   go there you can approach the Imam of the Masjid \nif the Masjid is a message upon and follow the   Hadith and the Quran you can go to them and try to \nportray your case to the Imam he may know people   that share the same values and he will match \nmake insha Allah you can go to websites that   don't post women's photos and don't give you \ndirect contact with the woman but rather with   her guardian so you see different portfolios and \nCVS and maybe you'll find something you like you   contact her brother or father and start pitching \nthen and may Allah make things easy for you foreign"
