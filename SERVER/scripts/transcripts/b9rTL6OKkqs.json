  "transcript": "now when we say a day in the life of the Prophet this is related to a science or a branch of science known as Al muhammadi the treats and characteristics of the Prophet Muhammad Alat wasam and this is different than studying the S why because it is more specific more focused do you know the science ofran have you ever heard of it Quran the science what what is it about it studies specifics of the Quran such as the reason and cause of revelation of a particular Ayah so as is part ofran it also speaks about abrogation verses that came and were abated for example that Allah as in he ordered the Muslims whenever they wanted to speak to the prophet they have to give s and this was abrogated because the Muslims said every time we want to speak to the prophet we have to give sodak they refrained and it was abrogated afterwards so this is a science that studies abrogation and there are other Sciences in this Quran if we study the will you find these informations yes but it will be scattered everywhere in it is about everything but when you come to it speaks only about the prophet specifics for example it speaks about his physical description his height his complexion his hair the way uh uh he walked it speaks about his manners his attitude his moral conduct so it speaks about how he dealt with his wives of course throughout the S you will find bits and pieces here before he left Mecca after he went to Medina when he married this but they come compiled it and put it in a folder and gave it to you when you want to study a specific thing of the Prophet Al his character with children with disbelievers with ignorance and with companions then it speaks about how he dealt with his transactions how did he buy and sell how he dealt in his daily lives how did he eat what did he eat what did he drink how many meals did he have how did he sleep how did he wake up what kind of attire and clothes he uh put and used to wear it also speaks about things that people don't usually talk about his ride how many camels what's their names his mules his horses his this and that if he had special plates on utensils what were they like his furniture in the house his house as a whole the so these things deal with what with the prophet specific things and related to him more specific than the general why is it important to study this branch of science because this is part of knowing your messenger it's very important that you know the prophet why the first and most important three questions you'll be ever asked are those in your grave what are they who is your lord what is your religion and who is this man who was sent to you three questions based on them Al IM Muhammad Abdul wahab compiled his book huh the three principle fundamentals very very beautiful nice short book but it is very very important in knowledge I have it on YouTube alhamdulillah I I explained the whole book and it's very nice but very very important for your so Allah says in the Quran or did they not know their Messengers so they are towards him dis acknowledging no we know our prophet and the evidence we know what he ate what he drank how he lived this is what you should know more than you know your own parents and to tell you the truth yes I know Prophet Muhammad Alam more than I know my parents there are things in my parents' life I don't know are hidden but in the prophet sallu alaihi wasallam life we know every single detail things that are so close and intimate we know of them and this shows you how loving we are to our prophet the more you study this science the more you love Prophet Muhammad sallai wasam and the more you love the prophet Alam the more you're closer to him in paradise and the higher your level in J and this is something that each and everyone is striving for if you have something in your heart that you find itching you then you have to cleanse your heart because you have to have full 100% Purity towards Habib your beloved Prophet Muhammad wasam the more you study this science the more you are forced to follow him yeah for example the Hadith of Ann Malik may Allah be pleased with him and we will study this maybe maybe not I don't know he said we were invited by a tailor to a meal prepared for the prophet so I went being the servant of the Prophet I went with himat and the man served us a plate of food and left for his work to continue his uh uh work what was the food anas says it was a a a pumpkin or Duba we call it in Arabic pumpkin you know pumpkin something like that and dried salted meat with you know the rest of of of what is cooked with so the prophet started eating and he started picking the pumpkins and eating it you know selecting it because he loved it not all of people love pumpkins right the funny thing is Anna says since that day it became my favorite vegetable or fruit whenever I find it I eat it why do you eat it anas because the prophet ate it so this knowing this science increases your love to the prophet and makes you want to do and follow whatever he is doing now if we would like to go deep and start with the prophet's dayat I'll tell you we will not cover everything in this Workshop but we will take tips here and there and the most important thing we want to get out of this Workshop is that number one we increase our love to the prophet Alam number two we learn how he lived number three we try our level best to comply to follow to follow him step by step so in the beginning sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam he used to wake up when B gave the aan now we know of course that he started his night early so I did not know whether to put this ahead first or later on so it's a mixture don't look at the Timeline because if we wanted to start from the middle of the night then we would have to go into waking up and going to bed and so we will just try to make it yeah as as easy as possible the prophet of course prayed nighttime and just before F he may take a nap and relax because the best time to pray as the time of D he used to sleep half of the night pray onethird of the night and then sleep one sixth of the night so when Bal called the aan the prophet Alam would wake up and he would first repeat behind the muin and we know the reward behind uh repeating behind the muin and then he would say the Dua is immediately after waking up all praise is due to the one who resurrect Ed us after our death minor death and to him is what we will uh uh go to and the resurrection is to when he wakes up the first thing he starts with is the siak brushing his teeth and throughout his life when he enters the house he starts with brother brushing his teeth before approaching any of his wives before going to Salat when doing wo personal hygiene was one of the characteristics of the Prophet you would never find an offensive smell from him ever to the extent that he prohibited honey upon himself when two of his wives collaborated and said to him that oh you smell maybe you ate uh some kind of Honey because they knew that he ate honey at his wife's house so they collaborated so that he wouldn't go to the third wife and this is the plotting of women Allah mentioned in the Quran your plotting huh is great while when it came toan Allah says the plotting ofan is weak now sisters are preparing rocks to throw on me alhamdulillah you guys are standing in between no no one is saying this we my mom is a woman my wife is yeah she's she's a woman and I've got daughters and women have a very huge part of our lives but at the same time nobody yeah neglects and can ignore the fact that when she puts you in her mind be careful that's why we are so kind to women and we're yeah doing our job to them because if they get really any irritated you you'll be in trouble so the first thing you start with when you wake up the prophet was what miswak then if he needed to perform if he was intimate he would go and perform because it's time for prayer one would say oh did he go to bed while in the state of janaba the answer is yes this is permissible you don't need to perform wul unless you want to pray so why burden Yourself by doing it you can simply make W and sleep and when it's time to pray you have have to perform W number three he used to perform M because he's preparing for Salat if he's not in the need of then he performs W and he said to us that performing wo unties the three knots that Shan does every time you go to bed Shan ties three knots on your head do you you have a long night sleep sleep and Subhan Allah every single night we do the same we oversleep we over sleep we over sleep I can't pray W I can't pray F what is happening okay you sleep two three days are you resting I don't need sleep sheh I'm rested okay go to bed he goes to bed he doesn't wake up this is from Shan so when you perform when you wake up and make vick one knot is gone when you perform W the second knot is untied When you pray the third knot is untight and you feel fresh you have this energy and stamina to go and work and you have a clear mind then sometimes in the day of the prophet he woke up and did not perform W and this is not normal some people unfortunately we see them in the Haram they sleep and they snore and they wake up for in and they go hey what are you doing so no no no I wasn't asleep didn't asleep you were wasted not sleep they said yeah yeah the prophet did this no mother saw the prophet once waking up and going to Salah the prophet of Allah you are asleep he says I'm not like you humans yeah others I my eyes sleep but my heart is awake which means that if I have passed wind if I did something that breaks my woodo I would be alerted and I know about it and this is what the prophet said in the the eyes are the are the rope that ties the water skin container when you tie it it cannot pour water so the prophet says the eyes are the rope that you tie the anus with so even if you sleep it unties this area so the gas would come out you will pass wind you will not feel it and this is the speciality of the prophet of course he ordered us the moment you wake up that you wash your hands how many times three times why you do not know where your hand was question does this mean that my hand is NIS no it doesn't mean that but it means that you have to wash your your hands before inserting it because at the time of the Prophet they didn't have faucets so it wasn't water that ran and you wash your hands no in order to wash or to make W you had to insert your hands in the bucket and if there was a NASA if there was something not good it would contaminate this water so the prophet said no you have to wash your hands three times and he also ordered us to Ren our noses three times why because the devil sleeps at your nostrils and you don't know what he had done there and so many atheists so many people of doubt they say what what does the devil do at my nostrils okay the Sheik's nostrils are big but my mine are small why is he doing well ask him when you meet him ask Shan what are you doing with my nostrils when you meet him but to me I believe the prophet says this what do I do the prophet told me something even more than that he told us that those who do not pray night prayer and some Scholars say no the Hadith is those who do not pray fer on time a man walked in front of of the prophet and his companions so they said oh prophet of Allah this man did not pray at night and the in so the prophet said this man the devil has urinated in his ear the devil has urinated in his ear some Scholars said that this is for night prayer those who do not pray night prayer Shan does this the majority said this is for a person who did not pray fer now how many of us do not pray fjer on regular basis a lot unfortunately notot of us and here Mah you're all Mah Scholars and great imams of Islam and Muslim I'm talking about those outside the Masjid a lot they don't wake up until it is 7:00 for work so urine is filling their minds the urine of the most NES individual on Earth Earth who Shan devil and they don't feel it they don't see it but it has a huge impact a negative impact on their lives and of course um The Prophet's was among the best but I think I'll skip this so that we can have enough time uh we will not speak about okay after he performs W what does he do he prays two what is called you call you whatever you want to call it he used to pray it so fast that if you see him you would doubt hm did he pray did he recite fa this is the Sunnah that you pray it what very fast but you do not miss obligations yeah you don't go for while going you say no this is not valid you have to be in to say once then you rise up once subh and and so forth it was very quick mother says afterwards what did he do he used to lie on his side and wait for bil to tell him it is time for prayer before we move on a lot of the Muslims make a very huge mistake they come to the Masjid and they pray and this Isam o why praying Sunnah no the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said there are no prayers between thean and the of only of except two of that's it so you don't pray voluntary prayers one of the great seven of of Medina he was in the Masjid he's the man who said I have prayed 40 years in the Masjid of the of the Prophet Alat wasam and I've never seen the back of any worshipper meaning he was in the first row for 40 years in Medina so he once was in the Masjid he saw one youngster coming praying two ra offering Salam praying T ra offering Salam praying ra said my son it is not permissible to do this he says why he said because the prophet Sall wasallam prohibited it and said don't pray except two ofnah so the boy again he's like us he wants to be convinced convince me my wife you have to wear the hijab no convince me Allah says Prophet says no I'm not convinced so I'm not going to wear it until I'm convinced bring your shotgun and say are you convinced now I'm convinced this is not Islam Islam is what submitting your will to Allah you hear something we say I ADH here and here listen I'm not going to argue Allah said it the prophet said it Kal I have no problem so the man said with his logic yeah Abu muhamad do you think I'm going to pray to Allah and he's going to punish me punish me for praying for him look at this logic and S Abu Muhammad said no he's not going to punish you for praying he's going to punish you for this obeying the prophet it's like someone who comes in and goes to the toilet and starts to pray in the toilet hey what are you doing it's not permissible he said do you think Allah will punish me for praying in the for praying for him said yes what are you doing you're doing something against the religion so don't logic things so he used to lie down on his right hand side and wait until B comes or sometimes he would chitchat with his wives because this is quality time this is the time when he is alone with his wife so they talk they yeah joke they do something nice together because it's quality time to make her happy and the moment bil stands outside the door he immediately comes out and goes to pray when does B do this and this is unfortunately a common mistake that we've fallen into we've become slaves and Servants of this electronic uh uh Gadget we have and I've seen mu waiting for it 9 8 7 he's watching the microphone is on for the and everybody in the Masid six five four what is this new year what are you guys doing the moment goes 0o they masallah makes Subhan Allah it wasn't like this at the time of the prophet the was given when what huh no no no no no no when is the K was given in the Masjid when the people come so the prophet used to sit in his home when B comes and says everybody's in the Masjid the Masjid is packed makes nowadays inah two people are in the mid why it's time who said it's time so the is to get the congregation together if the congregation is not there we wait no problem so whenever B saw that the congregation are there he used to notify the Prophet The Prophet goes out of the house what does he do he makes thear when you leave the house he makes thear when he enters the Masjid is a Cornerstone of the life of the Prophet alhamdulillah I think we've managed one year to make Muslim somewhere I don't know if Masjid or somewhere I remember doing it in Kuwait thear is a very important thing in your life yeah if you have a computer anyone do you have antivirus yes why because to protect me from virus says you need AAR this is your fire wall from Whispers of shatan from evil eye from Black Magic from gin possession from all kinds of bad things with the grace of allahar when you leave the house AAR when you enter the Masid AAR when you ride in your carar when you eat when you finish when the toilet blah blah blah everything AAR all day long then he goes he ensures that the rows are fixed before starting the Salat in someth it tells us the prophet used to come out and sometimes his hair is dripping water why of what huh of and sometimes they're all standing and he says oh remain as you are he goes home he takes aul and comes back while they're still standing and then leads the prayer after the prayer he would say to them ah I came I forgot I was in the state of janaba I performed and I came out what is this what is this this is transparency this is the life of your Prophet he's not ashamed of being a human being like me and you you and I would hide things would try to one of the brothers said to me I came he's an IM I came to the Masid then I said allahar I remember that was not in W so I said what did you do said nothing I completed my Salah and then made you're a you're the IM how dare you do this s what did you want me to do embarrass myself and say hey I'm not in w i I'm sorry I farted sorry sorry sorry but you let the prayer pretending in front of Allah that you are praying while Allah knows you're lying you're deceiving the people said well I was embarrassed she I did not know what to do this is huge our Prophet Alam the beauty of our prophet he was a human being like you and me there's nothing to hide and he shows us to teach us as our father he used to say by the way I'm your father don't be ashamed of what I'm going to say to you so he teaches us as as a father and we learn from him so he was a human being like everyone else when he prayed fer and F is the most important Salah which the Hypocrites are identified by it people who don't pray fer Hypocrites or have characteristics of hypocrisy people who pray fer mashallah good Believers so he would make certain that he prayed fer his daily routine after praying fer he would sit where he prayed F remembering Allah making Vick until the sun rises every single day he would sit where he is nobody comes for questions and answers or this or that no no no no no this is a sacred time we pray we make vick we do this we do that and if you want to speak on your own it's up to you the the time is wasted for you but for the the prophet he used to spend his time making sometimes he would say 100 times as in the narration of they used to count one narration 70 one narration 100 so he would say thear which is which are very long usually with us it takes like 10 minutes but when you say it because how do we say what is this what did you say I said Subhan Allah alhamdulillah allahar but you said it in a very quick fashion we focus on quantity not on quality he used to say 100 times how do do we say we don't even concentrate subh 100 times so on so so many things he used to say it so these is are to be said while sitting in this blessed time the people of Medina and the is Muslim used to bring water containers for him to do what to dip his hand in it so that they can take it back for Baraka for healing the only person an individual on Earth that this can be done to is Prophet Muhammad Alam when he was alive he was the Baraka so his clothes his uh sweat his saliva whatever he touches all Baraka oh shik this is shik no it's not shik this was done by the companions in the life of the Prophet under his sight and he never said to them anything even his sweat they used to mix with the musk and they used to say oh it is the best of perfume oh prophet of Allah and he ackowledge this they used to fight when he makes W to take take the droppings of the woodoo and and wash themselves and the prophet would overlook this so they used to do this with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam seeking blessing after finishing he used to give them a reminder after fer everybody's awake everybody is fit minds are clear this is the right time for a a reminder a d nowadays where is the exit everybody just wants to go and look for a pillow some people even come to the Masjid with a pillow with them you know just in case they want to just crash no the the companions started their day before F they started their day before fer Imagine One Day the prophet prayed F Alam and he said who among you is fasting today Abu Bakr raised his hand I am question number two who among you fed a poor Muslim Abu Bakr raised his hand I I did feeding a poor Muslim we just pray F and when did you do this then the prophet said who among you visited a sick person abak said I did who among you followed the funeral to the great to the cemetery and I did the prophet said any Muslim has these four characteristics in him in one day will enter Jenna I know people friends on every Monday and Thursday they're fasting they in go deliberately to hospitals ICU units or just random Muslim Salam alaykum oh Uncle I hope you're fine well this is a uh book okay of flowers or some sweets are you diabetic I brought you some cake so they start giving yeah gifts they visited a a sick person they go they find random poor people they feed them they go to the cemetery for and they will find a funeral there they'll pray funeral and they'll follow it alhamdulillah they have the four thing done easy how much did it take half an hour an hour what an investment you guarantee you go to Jenna who will do it ah she I have work and after the work we have the gym and then we have to see the boys I have to do some shopping uh maybe next week maybe next month maybe next year maybe next life life is running and we are not catching up unfortunately so he would give them a reminder he would give them a sometimes after F he would ask because from after F and the time is blessed we have an opening till so he asks about their sick people I don't see brother Abdullah oh Prophet he's sick okay let's go and visit him after fa they go and start to visit or maybe someone comes with a funeral and they pray janaza and they follow it to the cemetery sometimes and this is a lot the prophet after finishing AAR sitting with his companions asks who among you saw a dream so one would say I saw a dream there was a pole going to the heavens and I got hold of it and this and that he said this is Islam and you will die upon Islam as per the Hadith of Abdullah Salam he said this once another man said I saw that there was something like a fountain of honey that it was pouring and you took part of it and and there was a line to the heavens and blah blah blah blah so Abu Bakr said W I will interpret it and don't interpret it so the line is Islam and you're taking part of it uh the honey is the benefits and the the the Quran that you're given the man said one after you took it and the other one took it the third one it was cut referring toan so Abu Bakr and Omar took by itman it was cut because he was killed so he interpreted H prophet of Allah tell me did I say the right thing he said you said mostly right but there were things that were wrong so this was the day-to-day activity of the Prophet after F if no one came up and said I saw something what would he say I saw a dream and he would tell them I saw in my dream this and that and the two angels came to me and they took me and you know the the dreams of the night Journey because the night Journey hadiths are many the prophet said I went to see people of paradise I went to see people of hell I've seen these people being tortured blah blah blah blah there was one night Journey the scholars say yes physically there was one night Journey where the Prophet Alam was taken according to the majority of Scholars to Jerusalem from Jerusalem to the 77 and then back to Jerusalem and back to meca in another narration some Scholars like IB K in thear says he was taken to the seventh heaven where he met The Messengers and each one was saying saying who's this and jel would say this is Muhammad abdah was he sent and then introduced then he went to Jerusalem and he offered prayer leading all the prophets and Messengers because if he led them in the first place they wouldn't have asked who is this we just prayed behind you why would we ask so this is an issue of dispute among historian and Scholars this is one night only but then there were visions that the prophet made this journey with the spirit not with the body so the night journey is was with the body and spirit but the others were were only by spirit and he used to after F tell them I went and I saw people of Hell being tormented over this and over that of sins and blah blah blah okay now having said that we have to acknowledge that the most dangerous thing and one of the greatest sins is to show your eyes what they did not see referring to what to dreams some people come out of Goodwill and say oh I saw you yesterday in a dream and it was very bad be careful you have to watch out and you have to avoid the following sins and the guy is terrified and maybe he benefits and he stops and when you ask the brothers the brother he says no I didn't see anything I just made it up I thought it would be a good reminder this is Haram the prophet said it is one of the greatest lies to show your eyes what they did not see and on the day of judgment you will be punished to bring two straws of barley and to make a knot out of them and you will not be able to do this this is one form of punishment so be careful of claiming that you've seen something which you did not see now the sun has risen the moment the sun rises the prophet Sall wasallam leaves the Masjid and enters upon his wives all of them not the one he spent the night with each and every one of them he visits them one by one the first thing he begins with as per the Hadith the Mis he starts to clean his mouth then he goes in offers Salam and asks about his wife how are you how was your night everything is f and doesn't stay long only for a couple of minutes just to feel that she is not neglected those who have another wife or a third wife or the poor thing who has four wives may Allah be in his service people think that it is fun no it's not fun it's a responsibility it's a lot of headache I've tried it for 25 years it was good fun but it was a lot of headache a lot of responsibility a lot of fear Ya Allah did I do uh I bought this one a perfume and this one I have to buy another perfume but there is five R difference ah it's negligible no I have to stick the five real and give both something equivalent in this it's a lot of headache so the prophet used to go to each one when you have more than one wife other wives accuse you of neglecting them ah of course you was with your sweetheart yes you did not remember us you did not give us a call every day you hear the same cracked record every and you when you go to the other one she says the same thing this is what your Co wife said the exact same thing because your plotting is huge and great so the prophet used to go to each one of them after F asks about them and does not stay long sometimes he used to go in and out while they are doing VI for example mother jya he was with her that night when he left to Masjid she was on her prayer mat making Vick when he came after Sunrise he find her found her still making Vick what did he say I have said three words or or or or few words that are equivalent to the whole hour that you've said and this is part of of mourning what are they three times and this is to be said in the F only not in the evening the most authentic opinion so this saying it in less than 40 seconds 1 minute is equivalent to her sitting for an whole hour doing Vick until sunrise Subhan Allah and how many of us memorize it or say it you do the math then the prophet Alam goes finally to the woman he is at her day in her house and he would ask remember this is after fuder he would ask do you have food if they have food he says bring it so he eats and if they said W prophet of Allah we don't have any food nothing the whole house is empty imagine you entering your house when it's empty nothing in the fridge at nothing in the cupboards nothing not even dates and this is the prophet of allaham so if they said we have nothing what would he say I am fasting the whole day I am fasting then he used to go back to the Masjid so this break of half an hour of seeing his wives and greeting them he used to go back to the Masid and some of them was there sitting some of them had to go to their Farms some of them had to go to the market so he used to go back to the Masjid they used to chitchat and speak don't expect the companions to be monks sitting in the Masjid and just involved in thck and prayer beads and Allah Allah Allah Subhan Allah who and doing these Sufi things no they were humans like us so they used to chitchat and speak about the things they used to do before Islam and sometimes they used to see say really funny things one of them would say when I was uh you know mush before Islam I used to build my idol that I worship from dates and I used to fix it and beautify it and put some honey on it and I used to worship it wholeheartedly and whenever I got hungry I looked right and left and ate it up you are eating your God so they used to laugh and the prophet hears them and he [Music] smiles and this shows you what don't be the religious police we as parents we sit home whatever happens from our kids don't do this don't do that don't sit like this don't why are you laughing no it's not appropriate give people a room to breathe give them some space as long as they did not do Haram leave them now many of us if they heard people speak like this fear Allah conceal your sins they're Muslims now they are sins are all erased it's different from someone who committed sins and then comes back out and brags and says well I used to go to nightclubs and I used to date women I used to do this woooo what are you doing conceal yourself these are cfir mushriks they become Muslims so they are praising Allah by guiding them the prophet did not say to them sh keep this secret don't tell anybody no it's okay this is different from people coming out on media exposing their sins yeah Muslims coming say yeah before Allah guided me I used to drink I used to do drugs conceal yourself said no no no I want people to share my experience no the prophet says Alam that you should conceal yourself as for mus and it's a different story and this is the evidence of it the prophet used to smile and this is one of his treats that he is smiley he used to smile and his description in the Bible in the old uh scriptures as or means the one who kills and the one who smiles said whoa what is this yeah this is contradictory no it means that the prophet generally speaking was always smiling his smile and good spirit would not prevent him from enforcing the prescribed punishment when it was needed so his softness is not weakness just because he smiled when someone killed someone and he needed to be executed he wouldn't laugh it off and say it's okay go when enemies attacked Islam and the Muslims he would not laugh it off and make fun of it and no he would fight and defend so these two shows you his strength and when we say that he was the one who Smiles it shows you what kind of a man he was why if you were in the position of the Prophet wasam meeting so many different shades of people bedwin Nomads Farmers illiterate people who are hypocrites the Jews the idol worshippers the people coming to uh sign a peace treaty people are of enemies they come every day to meet you how is your psychology going to be how is how would you feel from the inside some of us after four or five hours of meeting at work they go home grumpy and you know don't feel like talking some of us come they just want to pick a fight his wife comes Salam alaykum honey how are are you huh I'm good what do you want I'm just asking you want to pick a fight what's wrong with you some of us come like this with this attitude seriously the prophet Alam Subhan Allah he's the man to learn from he was smiling whatever happened outside is not conveyed inside a real man leaves work leaves trouble leaves calam outside some of the men unfortunately and I know this through counseling sessions when they come and complain some of them dump their problems on their wives the moment they go in the wife has been there for 10 12 hours between four walls cleaning uh ironing cooking taking care of the kids so she's receiving you with a big smile she she is trying to make you comfortable all what you say oh I have so many de so much debt on me the manager said this and that and the Tenant the landlord want money the the the car is not working and he dumps all his problems or his wife this is not the right thing to do a real man keeps a barrier between what happens outside and what happens inside and this is why Omar said may Allah be pleased with him I love it when a serious man in his home is like a child playing and jumping around a serious man in his home with his wife and kids he jokes and plays around he's not serious but unfortunately some of us have this Persona of being serious being a scholar even in his house Daddy Daddy can I have some money to buy chocolate or uh it's an issue of dispute the money you want is uh change or you wanted a credit card or come on loosen it up this is not a fatwa you're not a sheh with your kids with your wife you are their father and their husband make it easy so and smiling by the way is a Sunnah the prophet said do not look down at anything of Good Deeds not even to to meet your brother with a smiley face and unfortunately being any local not from here from somewhere else Subhan Allah we have this arrogance in US you go to government offices passport offices police the judge or even he doesn't look at you he doesn't even reply to you uh excuse me can you please tell me where he looks at you as if you're begging him he wants to spit in your face he says go there and he what kind of Islam is this sometimes he's a judge he is a judge a Shar judge and this shows you that they have nothing related to Islam they are paper pushers they clerics with beards and a degree but it true Islam is to walk to talk okay sheam sometimes you're also Savage and rude true true but I am only Savage and rude to people with OCD and I don't think anyone would come and say well she you've been rude to us and we're not OCD is I am this rude with mental people when someone comes to you in counseling sessions and says I've divorced my wife okay but I don't think I divorced her okay but I may have divorced her she so okay make up your mind how would I know no she I think I said this and that and I said to him okay she's not divorced you there is no divorce but she I'm afraid this is no there's no divorce believe me I read on Islam Q&A if you read an Islam QA what the heck are you doing with me go to Islam Q&A no no I need to know she is not divorced you're still married and he calls me for 3 months every single day she I just remembered about 10 years ago I think I committed an act of apostasy so then I married my wife I don't think I repented so so is my marriage valid I have six kids do you want to divorce your wife no I don't want to do start to cry okay she there is no divorce but I was a postate are you sure no but I think ah so what do you expect me to do I can't take this I'm 64 years of age I have high blood pressure I have three stance in my hearts I'm diabetic I'm going to die soon you're not going to kill me I will kill you first so I start to lash my anger at them I make fun of them I you know slap them right left Center until they feel vulnerable the vast majority of them learned the lesson and that's why they call me uh she I called you 3 months ago please please don't don't shout at me please don't curse me don't what's wrong you I don't remember you when he starts to speak said okay okay and he notices by my voice but I think she no no no there's no divorce thank you he hungs up okay mission accomplished so I do this purposely only counseling sessions for those who need it those who do need it I I I hope I am a sweetheart and and a good guy and if I don't I'm not suing I don't care uh so uh sh is to smile in your brother's face and specifically those you do not know so you just don't smile to those you know people who come whom you don't know you you know show your Grudge and show your frown on your fist no you're always smiling and this is part of your Islam the prophets alam's companions described him as speaking little and smiling a lot so he doesn't speak a lot speaks little but his smile is always there for whomever he comes uh to meet him now laughter in Arabic is great part of it is smiling so to to to smile is a form of laughter but the Prophet would never ever laugh with a loud bang you know that people laugh and open their mouth and you can see their cavities and investigate everything what is this no the most he would do is just you know you could see his teeth but not open his mouth and definitely not with a voice ha and some people fall on their back some people start to you know weep and and tears come what what is this and the the the the the sad thing is that people even pay money for that they go to standup comedy Comedians and they pay them money to mock them to scold them to say bad things about them to roast them as they say and they laugh and they make fun of religion they make fun of your nationality they make fun of everything this is yeah a for of Insanity The Prophet used to laugh and smile whenever it was needed once there were women sitting at his side speaking to him from quray from his tribe and they were loud in their voices oh they're doing this they're doing that and the prophet was there among them listening to their complaints when all of a sudden knocked on the door and said amum he wanted to come in immediately they slowed down and nobody was speaking so the prophet and and and they started taking hijab putting hijab on and covering themselves appropriately and Omar was given permission to come so he entered when he entered he saw the prophet laughing so he said oh prophet of Allah may Allah always make you and happy in a good mood tell me why are you laughing he said Subhan Allah I was amazed of these women who were raising their voice in my presence and the moment they heard your voice they calmed down and they started covering themselves properly and they've done this and that so the it shows you the character of the Prophet Alat wasam that he was a I wouldn't say a cheerful person in the sense but he was a pure Soul the prophet would not find it harmful to express his Joy his laughter his amazement of what is happening and this shows you that our religion is a religion a live religion it's not a the religion of being dead being serious don't speak don't act don't you know be be very slow don't no no no no Islam is an ongoing religion have fun smile do practical jokes if needed no problem in that the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam was addressed by his companions they said oh prophet of Allah you joke with us you're the prophet but you are joking with us and he said yes but I never say except what is true I joke but everything that comes from my mouth is what is truth the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam had a companion of his his name was zah Haram zah was a nomad you know the nomads live in the desert they have their cattle they go from one place so they don't have a fixed place to stay so he was a companion of the Prophet Alam whenever he came to Medina to sell wool or ghee or whatever products they they have to make money he used to bring gifts and give it to the prophet wasallam as small as they are and the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam appreciated that so whenever he wanted to go to his desert the prophet would also give him some gift and they had this love bond between them and the prophet used to say zah is our uh uh desert area and we are his uh uh verb any suburbs or his City one day the prophet went after the Salat in the spare time in the middle and he found him selling some of his products in the market auctioning you know who wants to buy this gallon of ghee it's original it's 100% chol cherol full not free and this so the prophet came from behind him sneaked behind him and embraced him not saying anything so if someone comes behind you and puts a lock on you and who's this come on let me go he who's this doing this to me when he knew that it was the prophet he kept pushing his back so it would stick to the prophet's chest he would not want to let go and the prophet announced itam oh people of the mark Market who will buy this slave from me he's auctioning who will buy this slave did the prophet say a lie he is a slave slave of Allah so this is the form of joking the prophet used to do and zah said oh prophet of Allah Someone Like Me Wah you will not find one bargain nobody is going to buy you me from you nobody's going to buy me I'm I'm worthless I have no value the prophet said but by Allah at the side of Allah you are valuable this is the humor the prophet hadat a man comes to the prophet sallu alaihi wasallam he says oh prophet of Allah give me a camel so that I would go and fight in the cause of Allah so the prophet says I will give you a son of a camel and the man said what would I do with a son of a camel said Subhan Allah a camel isn't it born out of a she camel so this big male camel is a son of a she camel I'm going to give you one so the prophet again plays with words in in order to put some humor once came to the prophet and found the prophet eating bread and uh uh dates and had troma in one of his eyes you know when it it comes in uh I don't know what's called in in in English in Arabic called when you wake up and it's full of mucus and and you can't see and you have to put some drops so he came to the prophet Alam and started eating with it and the prophet said to himam Subhan Allah you're eating dates while you're having troma in your eye and how is this possible so so said oh Prophet I'm eating with the other eye with the good eye so the prophet smiled this is how the prophet used to live not or this or that and everything is what's your manh come on live like the prophet enjoy life how as he used to sallahu alai wasallam how much time for Salah okay so this is what the prophet used to say or to do when he used to sit with the Companions and they used to chitchat he used to smile he used to laugh with them but as a human being as a balance as a perfect human being he also used to cry he also used to weep because he was filled with emotion it is to totally wrong to say men don't cry on the contrary men cry to prove that they are real men the prophet Alam used to cry out of Mercy for the dead out of fear for his umah out of fear of Allah whenever he heard the Quran whenever he attended a funeral whenever the Sun eclipsed and he is the one whom Allah forgiven the previous and the upcoming sins yet he used to be this emotional so let's take a preview because this is part of how the prophet lived and see how he cried number one abdah says when the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam read this Ayah my Lord of ibraim my Lord indeed they have led astray many among the people so whoever follows me then he is of me and whoever disobeys me indeed you are yet forgiving and merciful and the Ayah of Isa peace be upon him if you torment them then they're your servants and if you forgive them because it you're all powerful and wise when he ever read these two ayas he used to raise his hands and he used to beg Allah Ya Allah I ask you I beg you have mercy on my so in the Hadith Allah says to jiel oh jiel go to Muhammad and tell him your lord is asking you what is making You Weep so jiel comes to the prophet and he says Allah says what is making You Weep so the prophet tells jelam what Allah already knows but this is from Allah to show jiel the angels and the prophet and the umah what is happening then Allah says oh jiel go to Muhammad and tell him we will satisfi you with your umah and you will not be sad meaning we will forgive for your sake your umah this is what is burning the prophet not money not wealth not a new car or a new house rather his umah he used to weep whenever he worshiped allaha may Allah be pleased with her says one night I was sleeping next to the prophet and he said to me seeking my permission oh leave me tonight so that I can worship Allah and she said W oh prophet of Allah I love to be close to you but I love what you love more so the prophet went and made W and he started to pray and he started to weep until his beard and his lap was filled with tears and he was sitting weeping until the floor also got wet from his tears Bilal came to notify him of the Salah and when he saw him pray he said prophet of Allah You Weep and you are the one who was forgiven his previous and upcoming sins why he says shouldn't I be a grateful servant if Allah forgives my sins shouldn't I be grateful tonight Allah revealed verses of the Quran woe to those who read it and do not contemplate upon them wo to them woe to them and he read the last 10 ayats of to the end the prophet used to weep when he prayed night prayer nobody's watching you yet when he prays theud and he recites the Quran you can hear an oozing sound to his chest because of him crying internally as if it's like the pot you know when it boils it it has this s sound to it he used to weep when he hears the Quran IB Mas says the prophet said to me recite the Quran and by the way I mud is one of the four companions that the prophet told us take the Quran fresh as it was revealed from these four abdah and uh uh I think zabit and another fourth one and and H and uh um ma what's his name Sal ma may Allah be pleased with him so this shows you what that Abdullah was one of the most learned in the Quran and the prophet said to him I'd like to hear it from someone else so he started from Surah 4 verse 1 until he reached verse 41 where Allah says so how will it be when we bring from every nation a witness and we bring you Muhammad against these people as a witness he said stop abdah said I looked at the prophet Alam and his eyes were watering and weeping he reacted to the Quran he felt the beauty of the Quran unfortunately you can't get this unless you know the Quran in Arabic and understand it and this is what I say you guys here in Kuwait have been blessed you're very very minor minority among the Muslims you're blessed to be in a Muslim country in an Arab country how much Arabic do you know nothing why the whole Community speaks in English as as the an introduction they brought a she all the way from Saudi Arabia to speak to us in English I came all the way from Saudi Arabia it's a 2 hours flight to all the way I'm not from Canada but it's a shame you guys have to learn Arabic W you will not find the sweetness of the Quran until you understand the F until you understand this these beautiful words you will feel the Quran penetrating your heart like an arrow and you will enjoy it the prophet Alam used to also weep when a relative died and this is normal with many people but the prophet used to do this a lot so his son ibraim imagine the prophet had seven children no boys three of them the boys died and this is why the ey worshippers used to say to the prophet to hurt him that you are cut off you don't have any male offspring to carry your name what is the meaning of this is the shortest Surah huh no close but no cigars huh no Offspring no see this is why you have to learn Arabic this is the shortest Surah you guys know it by heart the one who hates you that's why do not let the hatred of people make you transgress in another Surah sh the one who hates you who is the one who's cut meaning his mentioning is not going to be continue they say oh Muhammad you don't have any male offspring when you die no one will carry your name no one will know you so Allah told him no the one who hates you is the one who's going to be cut and nobody would ever know him or his offspring or his lineage so the prophet was award did with ibraim when he was like 61 62 years of age you could imagine how happy he was he had only girls and most of his girls died only Fatima remained so Zab all died in his life Abdullah Alim all died in his life so when Ibrahim came his mother was Maria Maria the Coptic his concubine he was very happy he was there loving him caring for him until the child was like 6 months old some say one year old and he got sick and he died and I am 61 I'm 62 how would you feel like the prophet devastated so he carried the boy while he was dying and he gave his last breath and his eyes were weeping and watery abdb said you Prophet of Allah do this you do this you're the prophet so the prophet said to him oh this is a mercy of Allah and he kept on weeping then he says the eyes water and weep and the Heart is saddened and we don't say anything except that pleases Allah and by Allah we are saddened for departing you ibraim that's it he would not conceal his emotions he would show it and this is why he was the perfect manat His companion one of the first to migrate one of the great Companions and one of the first to die in Medina among the muajin among the immigrants when he died the prophet Alam came he kissed his forehead he's dying he's dead and he started to to weep for missing His companion Alat one of the prophet's daughters died and was buried and the prophet sat next to her grave also weeping and all of this to show you that he was filled with emotions it's not bad or unmanly to weep and to cry whenever he remembered loved ones departed ones he would cry once he was with his companions and he started to cry so they said why are you crying oh prophet of Allah he said I requested Allah to ask for forgiveness for my mother and he denied me and I asked him permission to visit her grave and he granted it me so he saw his mother for what few months yet still all this time he has this love natural love to his mom his eldest daughter Zab was married to her cousin AB maternal cousin so his mother and Khadijah were sisters and he was captured in one of the Expeditions and taken as a prisoner of war and at the time Z was in Mecca still with him as a wife they were not ordered to separate Muslims from non-muslims it was still okay so she sent as a ransom to free her husband a necklace this necklace was given to her on her wedding night by her mother Khadijah so she sent it to the prophet and the moment the prophet saw it he felt soft and he started to cry because it reminded him of Khadijah and then he said to his companions if you wish to set her prisoner free and give her back what she paid as a ransom that would be a nice thing but this is a suggestion I'm not ordering you this is your right and immediately they said of course the prophet of Allah and they set him free and the prophet took a promise from him from his son-in-law that he would send Zab to Medina and he promised him that he would do so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was softhearted whenever he remembered Khadijah after all these years he would feel soft he would cry because he had immense love to this woman who gave him most of his children and who gave him support at the darkest time when he was in Mecca this type of loyalty this type of Love is Unforgettable you can never forget this no matter how many wives you marry and this is the caliber of real men how much time do you have stop uh okay okay I think we'll stop here here inshallah and we will resume after the Sal here is a place"
