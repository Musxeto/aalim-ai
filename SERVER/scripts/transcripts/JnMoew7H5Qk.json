  "transcript": "says can I shave my beard in a non-muslim country where I'm forced to join the Army if I don't I'll be arrested the scholars have all agreed that shaving the beard is sinful and not permissible there is a consensus among Scholars when it comes to shaving the beard however Allah azzawajal has gave us the concession the permission to do Haram things when there is a real necessity if I'm stranded in the desert and there is nothing for me to eat and I'm about to die because of starvation and the only thing reachable to me at this moment is a dead dog I'm not going to do hot dogs but it's a dead dog so I can eat a morsel or two or three just to sustain my life and to remain alive until Allah makes a way out for me this is permissible for or due to necessity and likewise if I'm about to be thrown into jail and this is not a probability this is eminent this is definitely going to happen and I have no other way to pay off the Army as in some countries you can skip mandatory um deployment I don't know what they call it for those who are 18 and above you can skip it by buying every year your way out from the government you give them like three thousand five thousand dollars and you skip it if there's no way in you have no other choice but to shave it or to be thrown into jail and all what comes with that in this case the scholars say you may shave it while resenting it with your heart and Allah would forgive you [Music] all right and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
