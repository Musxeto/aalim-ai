  "title": "What is the Best time in Ramadan When Dua is Answered? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] is there a special hour day week or time during Ramadan when do I will get answered first of all Ramadan is a blessed month and a lot of people say it's Ramadan Kareem this is wrong Kareem means generous and Ramadan is not generous by itself it doesn't give you things Allah is Kareem but the appropriate description would be Ramadan Mubarak nur Madan is blessed so the word that a lot of us say whenever Ramadan is due and said all mashallah Ramadan Kareem Ramadan Kareem this is wrong we should say always Ramadan Mubarak it's a blessed month now the month is blessed and whenever you make dua Allah Azza WA JAL is more likely to answer it than any other time but there is a specific hour every day that a la Sol answers your dua more likely than any other time and this is as the Prophet said adding salt when you break your fast whenever you break your fast Allah Azza WA JAL answers your dua more likely than any other time of the day and night but what is meant by when you break your fast some people think that after they eat drink feast and then they make du'a and this is not true the most authentic opinion is that the dua made just right before you eat your date so like half a minute or one minute the food is on the table the dates the caja everything else and you raise your hands and you say oh Allah at hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen la ma salli wa sallim ala muhammad o allah do this do that for me forgive me a pay of my dad's guide my children give me health this duaa is answered is heard by Allah Azza WA JAL and you're more like most likely to be given what you ask Allah Azza WA JAL why because I am hungry I am thirsty I am in submissiveness to Allah I am humble I'm expressing my poverty this is the time most likely that a large L would answer your door and by the way this is something extra as usual it's on the house when we raise our hands and self and heads from rock or what do we say we say Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah those who know Arabic what is the meaning of Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah all Arabs would say it means Allah listens to those who praise Him and this is not correct Allah listens to everyone even to the kafir nothing hides from Allah is all-hearing and all seen sami allahu liman hamidah means that Allah responds and answers to those who praise him so Samia here means to respond an answer and why do I bring this up now because I've heard so many Muslims complain ok we do dois at the time of break are fast I know what doesn't respond oh it doesn't answer no you're wrong Allah answers and Allah responds but you have a problem your problem is that you do not understand and realize how Allah answers your drug so what do you mean Sheikh the Prophet told us our s salatu salam it is one of three you say o Allah grant me a hundred thousand dirham and all of a sudden masha'Allah you have a hundred thousand dollar either through a business deal that was successful either through inheritance either through a gift if you find someone who would give me this I'll be more than happy to accept number two Allah grant me a hundred thousand dirhams it doesn't come but subhanAllah just an hour ago I was driving and a child ran in front of my car and I barely missed him I'm Dalila Abdullah now I said these are my ABS brakes hmm these are my skills and driving these no no no if I were to kill that child I would have paid blood money a hundred thousand plus two months in jail plus plus plus though it's not my mistake so Allah answered my dua by deflecting a hundred thousand that would have gone out of my pocket for this incident number three Oh a grant three hundred thousand Allah doesn't give me it here Allah does not deflect it as well but on the day of judgment when the scales are put and I know so many sins that I have and then I see a lot of good deeds I prayed only five times a day I don't have extra night prayer taraweeh I don't have charity what is this maybe it's the wrong account so no you used to make dua one of your dua grant me a hundred and this is it Allah give has given it to you in good deeds seriously then I would be stupid not to make dua 24/7 the answer is yes you would make dua trust allah azza wajal have confidence in him and he will give it to you the best time is when you make a far before you break your fast so after I break my fast what is the prescribed thicker the most authentic is to say the Hobart varma web tell little rock with a battle a duel in sha allah this summarizes the dunya we live in I've been hungry starving thirsty for 16 hours it's hot out there now the moment I put a piece of date in my mouth and drink a sip of water the dua is the hub of Irma the thirst has gone because I just drank water what tell little my veins are nourished now with food and water with a bottle a guru insha Allah and the reward has been set and recorded with the grace of allah this is dunya no matter how long you live this what happens there is hardship there are so many things that you want and desire but you refrain because you fear a lot so L once you die and you see your spot in paradise you will say the hababam oh what a little arrow was a battle as you'll in sha allah what about the door that a lot of people say allahu malik assumed well I learn aromatic after taught and so many others do I all the doors you know of are not authentic they're weak so the one I've stated to you is the best and it's the most authentic insha'Allah [Applause]"
