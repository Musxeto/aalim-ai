  "transcript": "from emirates my question is uh i've heard that the rasool allah while in prayer while reciting the quran that he used to make dua whenever the quran would mention something about the mercy of allah he would ask for the mercy of allah i'm just wondering is this authentic and how we can apply this to our own for example like okay what you have referred to is authentic whenever the prophet salallahu salaam used to recite in night prayer not in fart this is related to night prayer voluntary prayers he used to recite in a very slow way pondering upon the ayat doing tartil and if he were to pass by an ayah where there is a paradise or mercy of allah azzawajal he would after reciting it say allahumma she used to ask allah from his mercy and then whenever he passes by an ayah related to torments or hellfire he would seek refuge in allah from that so this is recommended if you're on your own praying voluntary prayers or you're reciting the quran on your own to do that if you're praying behind an imam and if the imam pauses for a while to do such a dua then you can do that dua as well and allah knows best you"
