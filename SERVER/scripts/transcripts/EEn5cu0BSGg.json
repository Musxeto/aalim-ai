  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. What is the kuffara or the expiation for the breaking of an oath for sexual intercourse with their spouse while fasted during the month of Ramadan? Yes sir. For the accidental killing of a believer and finally for the har? Jazak Allah Khairan. No no no no no no wait wait wait. What is your question? Not questions. What is the expiation for the breaking of an oath? Okay. The expiation of breaking an oath was mentioned in Surah Al-Ma'idah where Allah Azza Wa Jal says, Number one, if you say Wallahi I will not do this or Wallahi I will do this and then you break your oath. Because an oath is something that you say for the future, not for the past. So if I say Wallahi I did not steal your pen, there is no kaffarah for this if you're a liar. But it is only for things to come in the future. So if I say Wallahi I will not do this and I do it, then I have to feed 10 poor people, Muslims, from whatever the middle food we eat usually. So some rice, some meat, some chicken, that would do a decent meal for 10 people. If not, you can give them raw rice, approximately a kilo and a half of rice, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. You have the choice between these three, whatever you choose is up to you. Financially, if you're unable to do any of the three, then you can fast as an alternative three days. You can't fast three days when you have money. Only if you are unable financially to do the previously three things mentioned, then you can go for fasting."
