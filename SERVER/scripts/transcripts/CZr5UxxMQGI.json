  "transcript": "foreign [Music] we continue to talk about the seerah the most or one of the most valuable divisions of knowledge in Islam the division that deals with the biography of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam The Mercy to Mankind we talk about we talked about the things or the events that took place before he was born and then we talked about his birth and now we're talking about how he grew up grew up I know as a normal boy yet he was known to be quiet he never put himself himself in trouble and he worked as a Shepherd as he was in the custody of his uncle we are told that the prophet sallallahu had never ever committed a major sin and there are few uh narrations that say or tell us that the prophet salallahu once attempted to go to the city and do what everybody else does you know to have to have some fun and that we were told that he once asked one of his colleagues to take care of his sheep and he went to town just at uh just Before Sunset and as he was going into town just before going into their clubs he heard some music coming from a nearby wedding so he listened to the music and he fell asleep and woke up the following morning when as the sun was in the middle of the of the sky so he knew that it was not meant to be for him to associate himself with such a joyfulness that may lead to something that is not uh permissible throughout his years not a single negative incident took place about our Prophet Allah so usually as we grow up people remember us for a black spot in our history they say you remember when you broke that window you remember when you had a fight with that man you know you remember when you did this or stole that or uh any incident that would Mark a stain in our in your record the prophet salallahu never ever had this stain as he grew up he was known among his peers among his people to be the trustworthy and to be honest and the honest the faithful to the extent that people before leaving would go to him as if he were to be a bank and put their deposits put their belongings belongings with him because remember at the time of the Prophet is there were no banks no institutions no governments so the uh it's survival of the fittest if you're strong you could easily go to your neighbor and take his money and maybe kill them nobody would be able to talk to you and that is why they had health which is a treaty which was done before the revelation of the Prophet Allah this treaty as the history books tell us was initiated because one man once came and had the transaction with a a Allah who was one of the dignitaries of Mecca and deprived this man from his right he did not pay him back what he deserves so the man was Furious and started to shout in Makkah is this the way that you treat your people is this honest is this justifiable so the other dignitaries of Mecca gathered and they said no this is unacceptable we have to put an end to that and they went to Alaska's house and they took the the man's belongings and and gave it to him and from then they had this treaty they had this agreement not to allow anyone to uh betray or to be unfair to those who come to Mecca this was was at the time Prophet Muhammad this was at the time of the Prophet when the prophet saws was young and he himself said that I was called to join in a in this treaty or in this agreement where if I was if I were to be called for a similar one in Islam I would have accepted because it was something the uh honorable something that was just and fair throughout his youth as mentioned before the prophet was known to be is the true trustworthy and the honest and whenever they see him they would say he comes the truthful uh or the trustworthy the honest Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam he was not a Shepherd for too long he started working in trading and there was this fabulous woman who was wealthy and was a descendant of a noble family and at the same time who was beautiful but she was not married she was twicely withered and she had children and she used to ask men to trade for her so she would give them money and she would ask them to travel to the Sham or up north or to Yemen and whatever Prophet this man makes she takes 80 and gives him 20 or whatever percentage they agree upon even women were Traders women were traders in in Islam allows this her husband is dead or is the one her husband was dead yes she was wedded twice she was a widow she did not have a husband at the time she had lots of money and Islam allows this though we're still at at the early stages we have not yet uh encountered Islam but nowadays if if a woman has money she has all the right to invest her money and work uh uh to enlarge her fortune in the permissible ways and within the Islamic boundaries may Allah be pleased with her and this was the woman's name she heard about Muhammad Ali and his honesty so she proposed to him that he takes part of her money and buy and buys good uh uh with it and trade with with that money to invest it he went on one Journey with one of her slaves it's called maisala and when they came back she was surprised to find that he made so much profit not like any other man before him and he was honest he did not keep any anything for himself on the contrary he gave her everything a waiting for her to give him his percentage she sat with her slave maisara who told her astonishing stories about his honesty kindness about his uh truthfulness never saying a lie never breaking a promise about being so kind to everyone around him being tolerant with Traders and sellers he again was the perfect human being so whatever you can imagine he was that man Allah the minute Khadijah heard this she could not help herself but to fall in love with him being an honorable and respected woman and knowing that he was an honorable man and a a truthful and trustworthy person she sent one of her friends just to mention her name and to test him if he is willing to get married or not so the woman went and talked to the prophet saws and you know started mentioning Khadijah and how a lonely she was and how uh the good attributes about her and the prophet at the time was 25 years old herself the majority of Scholars say she was for 40 years old there are some narrations that say that she was 28 years old but we will go with the majority and consider her to be 40 years old Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her Center friend who proposed to the prophet saws a prophet agreed on accepting her so he went to his uncle and told his uncle Abu Talib that I'm interested in marrying this woman Abu Talib was happy because she comes from a noble family and also she is Rich so they approach her uncle they propose to her uncle and her uncle approved of the marriage she conceded and they got married then the age of woman is not a problem as we believe today actually the age the age of a woman is not a problem but it helps see this is not the case to marry someone who is older than you but if the woman you're interested in has virtues that call you to marry her is a woman with excellent Behavior if she has a good faith a good faith and strong belief in Allah committed practicing uh Muslim then the age is a secondary stage and has money well money is is a helping Factor but again personally speaking I would not marry a Wilson woman because it's always better to have the upper hand you do not want at the end of the day someone to insult you if she's rich and she pays something to you and tells you that I did this for you and I did that for you no you have to be a good husband it is your responsibility to support uh your wife it's not hers to pay anything for you I believe that we have a short break so stay tuned and welcome back the prophet sallallahu was happily married to Khadijah and they lived a very happy life they had children and the prophet saws was known to be Abul qasim because he had Al qasim and he had Abdullah and they all died in their infancy and he had four daughters from Khadijah he had zainab he had Uncle Tom and he had Fatima and also he had rukaya and again they all died in his lifetime with the exception to Fatima who died after six months after he died he had a very happy life with Khadijah and indeed he had a very happy life because Khadijah was the perfect wife wise beautiful knowledgeable she took good care of our Prophet who she could not help but love him the prophet Allah whenever he remembered Khadijah he would feel so faithful to her and he had tremendous love to her to the extent that she had a sister and her sister's name was Hala and whenever the Hala would visit the prophet saws and we're talking about about 10 years down the line 10 15 years down the line whenever she would visit the prophet sallam he would honor her and give her presents just because of the memory of Khadijah and in one incident he heard her voice once and then he said oh Allah this is sort of Khadijah and Aisha was there so she could not help but feel jealous so she said to the prophet sallam complaining in anger why do you always mention a woman that was 60 70 years old you know skinny and and she started describing her in a very nasty way out of jealousy of course she was a child herself why do you keep on recalling her and remember her remembering her Allah has given you far greater wives better greater wives than her the prophet saws was outraged he was so Furious and angry that he said to her by Allah he did not give me better than her ever she believed me when people thought I was a liar she supported me with her money when people deprived me from shelter and support she stood be beside me when everyone abandoned me Allah azzawajal has given me children from her where everyone else I was deprived from having children from by Allah I was not substituted I was not given better than her please with her hearing this says by Allah I swear that I will never mention her in a negative way after that this shows you the amount of love our Prophet is and indeed she had all the right to be loved with all the support she gave our Prophet with all this tremendous care and love she provided him she deserved to be remembered after all these years after she passed away after the prophet saws married seven or eight or nine women after her yet she she still had a very very special place in his heart nowadays we have a saying that says behind every great man there is a woman because this thing be applied to the case of prophet Muhammad most definitely but she was not the cause of him being great but indeed she was the best support any man could have and going back to the way she treated the prophet we don't have a lot of Hadith discovering this but we can understand by the indications here there for example the prophet salallahu told us and we were told that while the prophet saws and Khadijah were there the Ark Angel Gabriel came Khadijah did not see him of course so the prophet is telling Khadijah this is Gabriel saluting you so she said he's saying she said she then looked at the prophet salallahu the prophet told her Khadijah Gabriel tells me that Allah azzawajal is giving you the Glide Tiding over a big house of pearl a big pearl that is your house and in this house there is no tired Sim you will not be tired and there is no loud noise of nagging of people shouting it is quiet and it's a big pearl and you don't have to work in it so this is a glad Tiding and this house is where it's in Paradise now if we look at this great Tidings one would wonder why did the prophet saws mentioned to us that the characteristics of this house in Paradise that there is no tired some minute you will not be tired and there is no loud noise and uh a noisy environment in it it's very simple maybe because she used to suffer from tiredness during the life of them because she used to work herself and her house and she suffered bearing six children that's that word as a reward from Allah and what about the loud noise because she provided the prophet sallallahu with the quietest environment for him to contemplate and to sit in Comfort she gave him the right environment now look at our houses and whenever I talk to the brothers complaining from their wives the most complaint that comes on top of the list would be nagging they always complain of them their their wives nagging shouting having a loud voice when speaking making a scene out of nothing Khadijah was at all not like this she was the perfect wife she was the perfect mother and you can tell by her offsprings when you look at Fatima may Allah be pleased with her you will find that she did raise excellent children because even Fatima who was a young child used to stand in front of the dignitaries of Makkah the tyrants of Makkah and shouted them and swear at them whenever they used to uh uh abuse her father or do something that is wrong to him she used to stand in front of them although she was six or seven years old this shows you the manner and the way that these children were brought up and all of this is accredited to the mother Khadija may Allah be pleased with her I also heard the Hadith the prophet Muhammad said many many men are perfect but only four women are perfect I didn't mention the Asia Maryam been to Imran and Khadija bintura well Fatima as I recall Fatma was not one of them uh if I recall correctly it is Khadija Asia the wife of pharaoh Mariam and uh the fourth one I forgot probably it can be a Fatima it can be someone else I'm I'm not sure of that this is true Khadijah was among the four women that were perfect because she was the perfect woman in the sense of her intelligence of her wisdom of her beauty of her kindness to her husband because a woman can be ugly but be the perfect wife at the sight of Allah azzawajal because she's doing whatever she can to help and to provide her husband with a safe haven with a nice house to live and and and and and be there coming back to our story the marriage was a perfect one except to the death of the the boys Abdullah and al-qasim in their infancy and the prophet Muhammad sallallahu had never married no no the prophet saws never took another wife until Khadijah died which shows the devotion and love that he had for her and we have to know that the prophet saws was 25 years old when he got married and when he remarried again it was said that he was 15 50 or 52 years old so throughout this time he only had one wife and this wife was not a virgin she was twice waited before which meant that it was not on the top of his list to have sexual relations he was not a man of sex driven as you know the westerners and the enemies of Islam tried to portray him otherwise he would have married again and again and again or he would have chosen someone who was in his age or younger to enjoy himself with but he did not even think of this until he was 50 or 52 years of age was which shows us that the prophet saws is not as his enemies portray him to be now throughout this marriage as mentioned earlier they had a very stable life but there were many events that took place before just before his Revelation everybody still trusted him they all thought of him as a trustworthy as the honest man he had a a position among the people they accepted him because of his Noble uh tribe because of his honesty and trustworthiness and because they could gain a lot from his wisdom it's true he did not talk a lot but it's also true that when he talked it was filled with wisdom and they all respected his opinion that they usually would seek because he had a very sound uh opinion and wisdom I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah we will meet again with you and until then"
