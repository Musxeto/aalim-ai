  "transcript": "abdullah from india he says \nthere's an argument we should not   buy Chinese products because of what they're \ndoing to our Muslim brothers in the uyghur community and their imprisonment of a million uh \nin in concentration camps which they definitely   oppose anything that is related to islam so \nsomeone says as a prominent scholar in in   where they're coming from in india said that \nwe must not buy their products because they   are enemies of islam his wife says or his mom says \nsometimes they can confuse one for with the other   just kidding don't i don't need any more hate \nmail so his mom or his wife says that by this   logic we should also buy cut uh other products of \nother countries that support israel that support   our enemies of uh uh they are enemies of islam etc \nin some aspect so what is the ruling first of all   what i buy is my own business so it's \ntotally up to you you'd like to buy green tea   be my guest you would like to buy coffee it's up \nto you what you drink what you buy nobody says   no you have to buy from these places or not \nwhy because even at the time of the prophet   the companions used to buy and trade with the \npersians the fire worshipers the byzantians   the room and the jews and they all had fights \nand skirmishes and wars with the muslims so   never the prophet told us hasan don't \nbuy from them or don't sell them   which means that it is permissible now when it \ncomes to personal preferences if you feel your   blood is boiling and you would like to help your \nmuslim brothers by any means you can don't buy   their product simple as that nobody's gonna say no \nno no you have to buy chinese products or french   products or american products no nobody forces \nyou to do this if you can't find an alternative   elsewhere be my guest so if i do it am i rewarded \ndefinitely for your intention you're rewarded but   you don't have the right to judge others or to \ncontrol what they do so you don't want to buy it   perfect allah will reward you for your good \nintention don't come to me and say okay but why   are you buying their products this is something \nthat belongs to me this is my own preference and   conviction you have nothing to do with it so \nstay out of it and i hope this answers your question"
