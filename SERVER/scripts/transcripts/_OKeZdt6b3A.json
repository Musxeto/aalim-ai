  "title": "Was Monk Bahira’s witnessing of the cloud over the Prophetﷺ specific to that journey?",
  "transcript": "Nazar from India shik while reading the S of our beloved Prophet I came to know about the Hadith on monk bahir witnessing the cloud over Prophet during the trade towards Syria does the significance of cloud over Prophet persisted all the time or was this event specific to that Journey Hadith of the monk BAH with all the details and the little little tiny gritty stuff it's an issue of dispute whether it's authentic or not but we believe that the vast majority of what was mentioned would not significantly give any extra to our Prophet because his prophethood his miracles were proven without the need of going to weak hadiths but if the trip with Abu Talib to aam to Syria was proven and that they met this monk bah who recognized the signs upon this young boy and he told his uncle to return him back to Mecca because if the Jews figured him out they would assassinate him if the story is correct then so be it it's it's not of a great importance now whether the cloud was on the prophet alai 247 or only when B saw him how would we know a there were no companions to narrate the the story to begin with this is why it might be a little bit yeah uh uh dubious to confirm it but nevertheless we don't have these details because there were no companions to narrate to us exactly what had happened and Allah Knows Best"
