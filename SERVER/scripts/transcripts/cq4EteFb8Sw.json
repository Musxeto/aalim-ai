  "title": "Severity of using curse words, cuss words or profanity in Islam, (holy sh**) |  Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "ram says i know cuss words are not appropriate to use but unfortunately these days our youth are so used to using bad words it's like embedded in their vocabulary can you please explain the severity of using such swear and cuss words in islam and its punishment in the hereafter using curse words which a lot of the youth and people in general use nowadays can be sinful and can be blasphemous it can take a person out of the fold of islam especially when it deals with religion so when someone says holy f or holy s about something now when you say holy this is something referring to something that is sacred in your religion someone says holy cow he has to be a hindu because they worship cows so for a muslim to use such words or sometimes may say jesus christ what's this or whatever these can be sinful and it can't take a person out of the fold of islam generally speaking a muslim takes great care about the things he says the prophet said alaihis allah that the cursing of another muslim is sinful is fiscal and fighting another muslim is kufar and he also said allah that a believer a true mutman is not a person who slanders who curses or who uses profanity and vulgar language so these are all indicating that this is sinful abu bakr was at the presence of the prophet when a man came in and started talking ill about abu bakr they probably had something to argue about and there was a dispute disagreement so the guy was talking ill about abu bakr al-baqr was not replying was not reacting and the prophet was sitting there ali and till it reached a limit where abu bakr could not hold himself so he replied to the man exactly in the same fashion here the prophet stood up and left alison so abu bakr said o prophet of allah the guy was saying these evil things and bad things about me and you didn't do anything and when i defended myself you said you you stood up and left the prophet said while he was saying what he was saying there was an angel defending you and replying to him the moment you replied to him the angel left and a devil came in his place and i would not sit in a place where devils sit so this is something that every muslim should be careful not to use vulgar language or bad words because this impacts his heart it tarnishes his record books and he would be sinful for that"
