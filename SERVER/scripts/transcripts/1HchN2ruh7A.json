  "transcript": "Neela from Bangladesh Sheikh I have two people in my family I have told them many times that whenever they're praying they should put something in front of them as a sutra but they never listen to me even I have told one of them that if you are praying and a man passes in front of you your prayer will be invalid but they never put something in front of them and when they're praying sometimes I wait until they give salam to pass in front of them but there is an emergency I have no other choice to pass so she doesn't invalidate their prayer and make me sinful first of all you are not their mother so you only can advise and if you advised them and they did not listen that's not your problem anymore move on secondly the issue of taking an object in front of you when praying which is called sutra this is an issue of dispute whether it's mandatory or highly recommended Sheikh Al-Albani and others say that it is mandatory but the most authentic opinion that it is not it is highly recommended so if they don't follow what you advise them to do they're fine thirdly if you pass between the spot where they put their head and their feet this invalidates their prayer but if you pass beyond that inshallah their prayer is valid"
