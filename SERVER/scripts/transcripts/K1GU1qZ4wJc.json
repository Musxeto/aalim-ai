  "transcript": "Our first caller is Ziad from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam. So my question is about the fast of Yamin Al-Kaffarah. So do I need to fast them consecutively? I have broken some oaths which I was not aware that I have to fast. It is like three or four. And I started fasting. But I got a little tired so I searched in IslamQn. And I say that it doesn't have to be consecutive. And if not, then in what period of time? Is there a period of time? Like before next Ramadan should I fast it or can I fast it as long as I live? Ziad, in IslamQn, did they say that you can fast or you should first pay the feeding or clothing or the sacrifice? This said that I am broke and I am a student. Okay, Alhamdulillah. I just wanted to make sure that you've understood it correctly. So the answer is, like IslamQn had told you, that the most authentic opinion is that fasting the three days for those who are financially unable to feed or clothe ten poor Muslims or to slaughter a sheep or to free a slave. The expiation is to fast three days, preferably consecutively. But if not, then there's no problem in dividing it. How far or how long is this period of time? There isn't anything prescribed. Because this is a debt on you. If you die today, you'll be sinful for not doing it. So you have to do it as soon as possible so that you get it off your chest. And Allah knows best."
