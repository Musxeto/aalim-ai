  "title": "Riya During Prayer Salah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdullah from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I had a question that in my salah if I take a thought of Riyadh and I just apply myself into Riyadh for a few seconds I do my prayer for only a few seconds and then I remember that oh no it is Riyadh and I come back. Will it be considered that my prayer is invalid? What are you talking about? Are you doubting that you're offering prayer because of showing off and Riyadh? No Sheikh, sometimes I just look at another direction and then my brother comes and then I correct my direction of looking towards the Muslim. Yes this is sinful. What you're doing is sinful because while you are praying you're supposed to look at the spot where you're prostrating. So what you're telling me is that when someone comes instead of looking in front of you and they come and you don't want them to see you distracted or looking left or right or somewhere else so you pretend that you're praying in Khushu' this is Riyadh. No doubt that you're doing something that is sinful but in order to counter it you should change your intention by rectifying it and making it for the sake of Allah Azza wa Jal, not for your brother or for anyone coming in. So likewise I have a lecture tomorrow and I got these feelings that I'm doing it to show off. Should I refrain from giving a lecture or should I say no I'm doing it for the sake of Allah and rectify my intention and still go ahead with it? So this is what you should do whenever you get such feelings of Riyadh that you should rectify it and make it for the sake of Allah the Almighty. Al-Fatiha."
