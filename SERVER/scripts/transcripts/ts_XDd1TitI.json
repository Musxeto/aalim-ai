  "title": "Is animal blood najis? Getting animalâ€™s blood on clothes, should we wash it before praying?",
  "transcript": "so meanwhile fatima says is animal blood nudges what if while slaughtering the animal some blood splashes on you or a mosquito blood is on your clothes must we wash it off before praying these are a number of questions and the first question is is animal blood najis this has to be explained if you're talking about the blood that comes out while slaughtering the animal the answer is yes this is nudges so if you get parts of it on your clothes you must wash it before praying because this gushing blood is necessary as for the blood that remains in the veins after the slaughter has been done so while cooking and the water is boiling i can see a layer of blood on top this is not nudges because this was in the veins if i am eating a piece of steak and it's rare and that is rare i only eat well done so if it's rare and you cut it and you see blood coming out this is pure you can eat it without any problem but the nudges is that the blood which comes while slaughtering or that comes out of a dead animal after being slaughtered this is considered to be nudges and what about the blood of a mesquito the blood of a mosquito is negligible and it is human blood therefore it is not najis but it's unhygienic so people by default usually would not have this on their clothes without washing it and cleaning it but if they do pray with it it's negligible and it is insha allah not impacting uh their prayer"
