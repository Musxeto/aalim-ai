  "transcript": "Final question is from Layla from the U.S. Layla. Sorry, yes. Your question. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. I wanted to ask, this has a lot of, it's a very long context, but I just, the main question is, I got pressured into a marriage about a year ago, and there have been a lot of issues, and some local sheikhs in my area said that I have multiple grounds for Huda, but none of them have granted me the Huda yet, and my husband rejects it, so what should I do? If you don't have the ability to get Huda from your husband due to the fact that Islamic centers are too scared of the legal implication to do so in your country, then you have to file for divorce legally, and once you get divorced legally, and there's no marriage according to the law, then you can approach any Islamic center with these papers of divorce, and they will give you khal' on the spot, whether your husband likes it or not,"
