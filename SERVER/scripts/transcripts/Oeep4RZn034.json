  "transcript": "thank you so much for the speech um I'd like to ask two questions can menting women uh pray Quran through the phone screen and the second question is are women the women that are menting are they more exposed to sh when they're on their men menes as for the first question reading the Quran from your uh electronic Gadget whether it is a um a monitor or a um computer screen or a smart phone there is no problem in doing this if you are uh uh on your monthly period or if a person is not in the state of wo what he's not allowed to do is to do so even recitation of the Quran while in the state of major ritual impurity known as janaba but while a woman in her monthly period she can read that from the Quran uh from uh the application she can read it from the tap because the tap is not a Quran it is a combination between the texts of the Quran alongside with a translation or the T which is other texts so it doesn't take the ruling of the mus as for the second uh uh part of the question the answer is no this is something that Allah has prescribed upon women and we cannot say that they're afflicted by Satan more than other women or let alone other men so there is no such proof to back this up uh or consider them evil as mentioned in the Bible for example there's nothing alhamdulillah in Islam as such and Allah Knows Best"
