  "transcript": "it's very very important for us and something that often times is lacking between the relationship between a child and the father specifically so this brother asked why amongst Muslims do we see an extremely distant and fear driven relationship between a father and their son and how can we try to create a better bond with our fathers a father is a father so the relationship between a father and a son is different in Islam than what is portrayed here in the West in the west things are totally messed up in the west a youngster goes to his father and would shout and you don't have the right to judge me people come to me in counseling sessions and and they say sh you don't have the right to judge me said the hell I do I'm from Saudi and an old grandfather and I'm not going to refund your money what are you going to do about it you come to me I judge you you do something wrong I judge you and you do something right people judge you and give you a thumbs up so the relationship between a father and his son is totally different in Islam your father is your Heaven or Hell your choice you want to go to hell look in a very bad and rude way straight in his eyes you go to hell Raise Your Voice you go to hell disobey him you go to hell disrespect him you go to hell first class I guarantee you front seat the issue is she but he's not doing his duties he's not fulfilling his responsibilities he should have done this to me and he didn't he should have provided for me he didn't you're right he's going to be held accountable on the day of judgment but you will be held accountable for how you react so him not doing his duty does not give you the right not to do your duty the the prophet saidat the father is the Middle Gate of J he's addressing us your father is the middle of J now you tell me if your father was a sweetheart and he most likely he is but if he was a sweetheart he gives you $1,000 every day would he adopt me I'm I'm up for adoption if he gives you $1,000 a day and he doesn't ask of you to do any shores of the house and whenever guests or relatives come he says says my son is the most courageous the most generous the most kind the most beautiful the the best son in the world and he helps you with your wife with your kids and he does anything that any one of us would imagine and want from his father now you tell me is it difficult to be beautiful and kind and obedient to him so where's the test he is your test from Allah when you have a rude father and I know that a lot of us may have rude fathers a father that doesn't understand he was born in a different era and he expects me to be like him gazillion years ago and this doesn't work he doesn't provide for me he favors my siblings over me he mistreats my mom in front of of me he may cheat on my mom and I know because I fixed his laptop so many times and I've seen the emails and the pictures and his Instagram page my mom doesn't know about that the poor thing so I have lots of resentment of of of bad ill feelings towards him this is not an excuse Allah is testing you are you flunking the test or passing if you're obedient kind kind beautiful and respectful he has to reciprocate one day or the other it may take time with a lot of Dua and with a lot of good will upfront from your side he will change but if he doesn't this is your test from Allah you have to be"
