  "title": "He lives abroad & his mother asks how he is, can he lie? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh no Han from Bangladesh so my question is about a brother he lives away from his family and he is going through a very tough time so now the thing is his mother calls him every day and I've asked about how is he like how is how is he doing so here he fears that if he he fears that if he tells her the truth she will get depressed or something or some other issues might occur so is it for me it's permissible for him to like to lie to lie to her lie to his mother like indirect speech he cannot like his mother ask things in detail so he cannot use indirect speech and reader so can he just flat out like to his mother the rule of thumb in Islam is that lying is prohibited so it is not befitting of a Muslim to lie straightforward lie but alhamdulillah we have a substitute of lying which is double talk so when someone says I need five reals can you give me five reals and I said wallahi I don't even have a single real in my my pocket and I'm truthful I have only a hundred reals bills so did I lie no I don't have a single real but I have a hundred so such double talk or ambiguous answers could always be fine your mom says how are you is everything fine and you say alhamdulillah Everything Is Beautiful everything is fine and you're referring to your health you're referring to your house you're referring to most of the things not that specific uh Calamity or undergoing there is no problem in that insha Allah but do not lie foreign"
