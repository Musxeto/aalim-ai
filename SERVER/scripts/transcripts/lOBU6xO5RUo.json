  "title": "Ep. 14 | Seek Refuge in Allah from a Heart that is not Submissive",
  "transcript": "[Music] can ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this program this new episode of selecting the beautiful fruits of what our Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said regarding the purity of the heart it's selected from 40 hadiths that was compiled on this topic and as we know our our Prophet was given the concise of speech so few words have great profound meaning words that you count you can count on your hand yet they have deep meanings included in them the Hadith at hand was narrated by abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that the prophet of Allah sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam used to seek refuge in Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and he used to say oh Allah I seek refuge in you from a heart that is not submissive that is not humbled from a supplication that is not answered that is not heard from a soul that does not have enough and from knowledge that does not benefit I seek refuge in you from these four the prophet started with the heart I seek refuge in you from a heart that is not submissive that is not humbled because if the heart is healthy and fixed then the whole body all our limbs would be healthy and fixed and this is why the prophet wasam sought refuge in Allah from an illness that may affect it because if it's affecting the heart then your righteousness and Good Deeds would be also affected and this is when the heart is not submissive when it's not humble I seek refuge on you from a heart that is not submissive a heart that is not submissive that does not have is a hard sick heart it is a heart that does not feel humbled when Allah is remembered when it listens to Allah's words when it's reminded unlike a heart that is healthy a heart that is soft a heart that is calm and submissive with the remembrance of Allah may Allah have mercy on his soul says the prophet sought refuge in Allah from a heart that is not submissive because when a heart is not submissive it becomes hard no reminder no advice no reprimanding or intimidation or even reminding it of what awaits for it with Allah in Paradise would benefit it such a heart is a hard sick heart Abu D may Allah be pleased with him said seek refuge in Allah from the submissiveness of hypocrisy his students ask what is the submissiveness of hypocrisy Abu D answered to see the body submissive with while the heart is not attentive is not in that case of submissiveness may Allah have mercy on his soul says no servant of Allah has been struck with a punishment harder than having his heart hardened and stiff or to be further away from Allah and the furthest Hearts from Allah is the hard heart as when the body is is sick no food or drink would have any taste or benefit to it likewise the heart when it is sick with desires and with doubts no reminders would ever benefit it because it is sealed it cannot hear and this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran when he said subhah and when Allah is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with a virgin but when those worshiped other than him are mentioned immediately they Rejoice the heart Falls sick as well as the body falls sick and the he healing of the heart is in Repentance and blocking the means of anything that would tarnish it or would hurt it so when the heart is submissive the limbs are submissive as well and they fall in line to worship Allah says a man once was seen to be sort of joining his shoulders and body and concaving upon himself like those who try to look in a state of and he was addressed by the scholars my friend submissiveness is here in the heart not here in the shoulders so when you see people walking like this and they're as if they're weak and sick and they tend to show that they are righteous and Pious but their actions what they say is different than what they behave this is the submissiveness of hypocrisy Al may Allah have mercy on his soul says at those who preceded us the Sala they used to hate When A Man shows more than what is actually in his heart this is pretending and this is not a good sign may Allah be pleased with him the companion of the Prophet Alam said the first thing you would lose from your Dean is and the last thing the last final strike that you would lose from your Dean is prayer and so many people who pray there is no good in them and soon you shall enter a Masjid and you would see the congregation and not find a single person who is in and this is really scary when we look at the people in the Masjid including us of course how they move how they behave how they're heedless and oblivious ask many of them what did the Imam recite I don't remember and the movement they have in the Salat it shows you that they do not have this case of then the prophet says and I seek refuge in you oh Allah from a supplication that is not heard what is the meaning of a supplication that is not heard when Allah actually hears everything so how is a supplication is not heard you remember in Salat when we rise from R what do we say we say Allah listens to those who praise him doesn't he listen listen to others Allah hears everything well listen here Sam means Allah responds and answers those who praise him so when the prophet seeks refuge in Allah from a supplication that is not heard he means that it is not listened to it is not answered and why would a supplication not be answered because it means that there are things that block your supplication such as consuming Haram earning Haram sins transgression the heart being heedless as we've mentioned in previous episode not being attentive not being obedient and many many other reasons where the supplication is blocked your Dua is blocked so when the prophet is seeking refuge in Allah from a Dua that is not answered meaning from causing the Dua not to be answered such as the reasons we've mentioned earlier then he says and from a soul that never has enough that is never satisfied and this is referring to those who who are indulged in Dunya all what they care about is hoarding collecting gaining money Halal Haram no one cares we just want to be rich we want to be influential and such a soul usually does not care about the Hereafter does not care about forms of worship and how to get closer to Allah and how to protect it itself from Hellfire gaining more money is not Haram it's not discouraged but when it come becomes a priority as we mentioned last episode when it becomes your goal then this is what you should be afraid of then the prophet sought refuge in allaham he sought refuge in Allah from knowledge that is not beneficial may Allah have mercy on his soul said such as sorcery this is knowledge but it is not beneficial it is harmful and likewise other Sciences other knowledge that is harmful in your religion or in this dun shaani says the prophet sought Refuge from knowledge that is not beneficial because it will backfire on its owner and it will be an Evidence upon him on the day of judgment so basically knowledge that is not beneficial is divided into two types one knowledge that is not beneficial in itself and that would be extremely harmful such as philosophy or such as sorcery such as music and the Arts and acting and the likes this is knowledge of course and it requires a lot of work but it is harmful in itself and it would lead the one who learns it to Hellfire because Allah has prohibited it the second type of knowledge that is not beneficial is knowledge that is beneficial in itself but due to the fact that the one who's learning it is not benefiting from it because he's not walking the talk or he's doing something against it or he is learning it with the intention of seeking D then this would not be knowledge that has benefit such as learning the Quran wo knowledge that is not beneficial is the Quran yes if you intend by learning it that people would point at you and say he's a he's a or they would give you money so that you could teach them and this is the only reason you've learned it if you found something more beneficial you would have gone and left it such as beneficial knowledge people learn from the Sharia but they don't pray they don't fast though they know the knowledge they know the evidence is backing it they know that RBA is Haram yet they go and buy houses in mortgage not only that they give fatwa to people the first house is fine it's on the house second house no it's Haram it's R this is knowledge that is not beneficial and they will pay dearly for that may Allah protect us then the prophet said and I seek refuge in you from these four why to emphasize that these four are dangerous and that's why he repeated seeking refuge in Allah from them from this Hadith we learn that the prophet Alat wasam had a very soft heart and that he was afraid of anything that would harm him his Iman his heart his relationship and connection with Allah and what would hurt his um likewise that is why he taught us these beautiful supplications these Dua so that we would open our eyes and see whoo is my heart submissive is my supplication hurt heard and answered do I have a soul that never has enough is the knowledge that I possess beneficial or not beneficial and we have to seek refuge in Allah so that Allah would protect us we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
