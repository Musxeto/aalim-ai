  "title": "How to react to hate against Islam, what should we do, can we protest? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I don't know if I understood the question correctly, but if I understood it, then Alhamdulillah if not, correct me. He's saying that we have to react. And I said, yes, you have to react, but your reaction can be positive and can be negative. A negative reaction is when you don't react. You don't do anything. You just sit. I said, okay, no problem. A negative reaction is when you go in demonstration and you break, burn, demolish, and do things that are bad. The positive, the Islamic reaction is to take a number of steps. One, learn the Quran, spread it, social media, printing books, doing da'wah, being a proper Muslim. This is the best reaction to it because when you just demonstrate and protest, this is what you find in Bangladesh, in Pakistan, in Indonesia, in other countries. Every time something happens, let's go to the streets. And people protest. Then what? Nothing. Next week, protest, protest. This is not the doing of the companions, nor the tabi'een. This is against Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah. This is for hooligism. This is for barbaric people to express whatever they want. And this is why, even in politics, you don't like politics, let's go to the streets. This is not Islam. So you have to govern and control your actions through Quran and Sunnah. Demonstration is not from the Quran and Sunnah. You honor your religion. You honor the Quran by the steps we mentioned earlier, and Allah knows best."
