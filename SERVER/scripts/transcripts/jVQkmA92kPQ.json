  "title": "Ruling on Personality Tests",
  "transcript": "The first question is, 'what is the \nruling on personality tests? Does this   fall under soothsaying?' What are personality \ntests? A lot of the corporates, nowadays,   mandate that a potential employee   that he, or she, must undergo a personality \ntest so that they can figure out what this   person is made of, what are his inclinations, \netc. And these tests are not all the same.   Some of them are scientific and they are \ncredible, and some of them are totally bogus   and not permissible. So the permissible \npart is the one that relies on facts.   Scientific facts. So they ask you about \nwhat you would do in particular situations,   how would you react when you're angry or when \nyou're pleased. And through such questionnaires   they would determine the type of a person you \nare. So if you say that 'I don't like to be   in a crowd.' 'I don't like addressing people \npublicly.' They know that you are an introvert.   You are not the person who likes to meet people. \nSo, definitely, in marketing you would not be   a good person. But maybe you will be a better \nperson working behind the desk - pushing papers,   etc., and accounting - you don't have to meet \nthe public. Other questions may reveal some of   your characteristics based on psychological \nanalysis, which is scientific. Such tests   are okay. Some corporates give tests to determine \nwhether you are good in HR, or in marketing,   or in sales, or in operation, etc. According \nto your answers they can tell your inclination.   Now, there are other tests that are totally bogus. \nTotally fabricated, not based on science. Rather,   it is more likely to be based on \nsoothsaying and fortune telling. Like   the one that sells you 'write to us a \nparticular paragraph and then we look at the   lines, and the curves, and how straight the \nlines were, and the dots where you place them,   and the stress of your pen - and we can tell that \nyou go to bed early, that you don't like chocolate   cake after a heavy meal..' What is this? This is \ntotally fabrication and soothsaying. Or by the way   you sleep. 'So how is it that you sleep? Is it on \nyour stomach? Do you crunch yourself like a child   in his mother's womb? Do you do this, do you do \nthat? Accordingly, your personality is so and so.   And you will be a good leader, a bad leader, \netc.' All of this is nonsense. Unfortunately a   lot of the the masses of the people are so hooked \non knowing the unseen, on predictions. So they   pay money. And a lot of those imposters would gain \na lot of money by saying 'okay, your first name...   the first letter is so and so. The middle letter \nis so so. The last letter so and so. This,   according to our calculation and to the zodiac you \nwere born in into your mother's name, all together   means that this is what's going to happen and \nthis is your character, your personality analysis   results.' All of this is totally haram. \nThis is something that is not scientific   and it's based on future telling, soothsaying, \npredictions, lies. There's no tangible   evidence - scientific tangible evidence - that we \ncan base this and therefore this is totally haram."
