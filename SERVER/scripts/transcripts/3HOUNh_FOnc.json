  "transcript": "Sufyan from the UK? Basically, Sheikh, I have a question in regards to breaking oaths, etc. So basically, Sheikh, before, like a lot of people, unfortunately, I used to make a lot of vows, like Wallahi I will do this, Wallahi I will never repeat this, etc., etc. The thing is, is that as of right now, I genuinely, sincerely can't remember most, if not all, of the vows that I've taken. The only thing is that maybe, maybe, maybe I vowed about not committing a specific sin, maybe, I'm not sure. And even if I did make a vow, for example, Wallahi I will never do this, do this and again, I don't know if I set out conditions such as, or I'll not do this for the rest of my life, or whenever I do this, I'll fast for 20 days straight. I genuinely, I've thought about it and I've forgotten. So what is the ruling on this, Barakallah, Ufiq? Ufiq and Barakallah. Number one, things that you are not certain of, you're not obliged to do anything about it. Because this is one of the rules in the Islamic fiqh, certainty is not affected by doubt. What is certain is, I did not make any vows. So one says, Sheikh, did you make a vow not to drink green tea from the mug? I said, no. Are you certain? He said, I didn't make any vow. I might have, but the rule is, the default is, that I didn't make any vow. So until proven otherwise, the default, which is the certainty, I did not make any vow. Therefore, anything that is doubtful, I might have done this, I might have said this, and you're not certain, ignore that and throw it in the dustbin. Those that you are certain of, but you're not certain of the number. So I'm certain I've vowed, or I made an oath not to smoke, and not to drink a pint of lager, and not to go to night clubs, and not to watch Netflix, and not to do haram things, etc. So I remember clearly that I've made these vows, or oaths, but I don't remember the number. In this case, we say estimate, providing that there are different issues, because if I made a vow not to smoke, and then another one, and another one, and another one, and like a hundred vows not to smoke, and I did not expiate for any of them, and I smoked like a gazillion times, how many expiations should I give? Only one, because it's on the same topic. So if these oaths are different, wallahi I will not smoke, I will not drink, I will not fornicate, I will not watch haram, I will not listen to haram, these are different things. But I don't know the number, I know for certain that I made these oaths. You estimate. How? I say, are they a thousand? He said, no this is too much. Are they ten? He said, no this is too little. Are they five hundred? Too much. Are they twenty? Maybe. Are they a hundred? No this is too much. Are they twenty-five? Maybe a little bit too much. So it's between twenty and twenty-five. Just be safe rather than sorry, make them twenty-three, just to be safe. And give expiation for that. For your third part of the question, I got a similar one on Twitter, I think this morning, and I said to the one who asked me, that I don't know. And I need to ask my sheikh to get it off my chest, because if I'm not certain of it, I'd rather say I don't know, instead of you guys coming and suing me on the day of judgment. If I were to say, wallahi, I will never smoke till the rest of my life, and then I smoked, and then I repented, and I smoked again, and I repented and I smoked again. So should I give expiation for every time I repeat the sin, because I said till the rest of my life, or one expiation cancels my oath, this is something I'm hesitant in answering. So I'd rather refrain until I ask my sheikh, who's one of the major scholars committee members of Saudi Arabia, and he's the son-in-law of Sheikh Ibn Athaymeen. Once he gives me the answer to that, inshaAllah, I will hopefully try to clarify this after understanding the ruling from him, and Allah knows best."
