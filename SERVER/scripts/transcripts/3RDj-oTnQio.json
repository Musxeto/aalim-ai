  "transcript": "sam from canada okay uh my question is uh you know there are grown-ups who uh don't pray and usually it's because of like it could be because of traumatic experiences of the past so maybe they were like forced to pray or their parents were really forceful on them and like so now they're grown-ups and they say that they don't want to pray because when they do it gives them this this flashback of their lifetime you know when they were kids so i'm just wondering like when it comes to you know young kids and like how do we uh try to encourage them to pray without being so like forceful or kind of making them feel discouraged okay first of all such people are a very tiny small minority who refuse to pray allegedly and claiming that this is due to a previous trauma when they used to be forced to pray such a minority such people are most likely hypocrites full-fledged hypocrites because you cannot come and claim that you are a result of a practice that we are instructed to do and follow in the sunnah this is agreed upon muslims the prophet said allah instruct your children to pray when they're seven and beat them up for not praying when they are ten three years five days or five times a day 360 days a year you tell your child pray fajr pray and you instruct him to do that you advise him no force used no compulsion for three years it's like i wouldn't say brainwashing it's heart washing so he sees everybody's praying he's reluctant he's lazy then he's encouraged then he's looking up to it then he's feeling good because everybody is praying he's one of the community for three years 360 days five times a day after all of this advice and reminding if the child does not pray then we are allowed to spank him without breaking a bone without leaving a mark on his body without making him shed any blood without it it's not torture it's just a spanx to bring him back to his sense senses and he's 10 years of age we're entitled to upbring him in an islamic way with compassion and love so if after all of that a grown-up in his teens or someone in his 20s he says i don't pray because of a previous trauma because of what my father used to do to me he's a full-fledged hypocrite we can't do anything you you can't force a horse to drink you can drag the horse all the way a couple of miles to the river and it will follow you but you can't force it to drink and likewise this individual who claims that such a trauma is preventing him from praying he's a blatant liar if this person comes out of a bank with a bag that has a million dollars in it and he accidentally drops it behind him and he doesn't see it or if he's walking and there's a hole with gators and snakes and scorpions and he's about to make one step and fall into it and if i am his fierce enemy if i shouted from across the street and cursed him slandered him called him names made him agitated and said listen you dropped the million dollars behind you or there's a hole in front of you that is filled with reptiles and animals that would eat you alive would he adhere and stop though he hates my guts and if he could he would have killed me or would he say i'm not going to listen to him let the million dollars go down the drain and i'm going to fall in this pit and let me die of course not so subhanallah why when it comes to saving your neck from hellfire and admitting you to jenna you are defiant and you claim that it's a trauma that was caused by your parents or your grandparents or whoever and when it's worldly issues you would listen even if it was your fierce enemy this doesn't make any sense you"
