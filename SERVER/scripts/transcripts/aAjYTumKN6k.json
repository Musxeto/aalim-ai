  "transcript": "Muhammad from Pakistan. Muhammad. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I have a question that what are the seven Ahruf of Qur'an? And if it is true that Qur'an have seven Ahruf, then what is the difference between ten Ahruf and seven Ahruf? First of all, there is no such thing as ten Ahruf. There are seven Ahruf and the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the one who told us that Jibreel recited the Qur'an to him in seven Ahruf. And seven Ahruf may relate to seven dialects of the Arabs where they have a different word for a different meaning. But the common denominator is that these words may look the same but with different dotting. So this is how the Qur'an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. Later on, those who learned the Qur'an from the companions with these different Ahruf were known to have ten recitations or ways of reciting the Qur'an or ten schools. And these are the ten Qiraat. The Qur'an is the same and everything in it is preserved as was revealed to Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. and a lot of the Huffadh, Al-Qurra', those who memorized the Qur'an, were martyred in the battles for expanding Islam worldwide. He was advised and he liked the advice and he collected all the copies and made it into one Qur'an with four copies of it, well known as Mus'haf Uthman. And this is the Qur'an that we all Muslims around the world memorize and we preserve and we have in our possession. So the seven Ahruf are not differentiated to us. We don't know that this is Harf XYZ, this is Harf so and so, and these are the seven Ahruf. No, the Prophet told us, Alayhi Salaatu Wasalam, that the Qur'an was revealed in seven Ahruf, it was all incorporated in the Mus'haf of Uthman, and it is found and distributed in the ten Qiraat and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
