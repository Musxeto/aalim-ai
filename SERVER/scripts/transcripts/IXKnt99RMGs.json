  "transcript": "clean does not mean it is not contaminated and dirty does not mean you cannot make Moodle up with that clean and dirty are terms that we use in our daily lives that has or that have no connection to whether I can make wudu or not so for example in some countries where they use ductile iron or some sort of metal pipes that rust if you turn the tap water in the beginning you will get yellowish water is this clean for you to drink no I'm not gonna drink this would you wash your clothes was it definitely not it's gonna sting is this permissible to perform water with dances yes though the color has changed but not with an impurity and a Jassa like urine or feces rather it was changed due to the rust the corrosion in the pipes therefore this is not clean but you can perform water with it and likewise if we have a container of water that looks clean smells clean but you see a drop or more of urine fall into it let me avoid urine because one of the characteristics did not change with an ijazah if you have a container of water and a dog comes and drinks from it licks it so it smells good it looks good but you know that this is definitely impure and that you cannot drink it and you cannot perform will do with it because it snatches to the folks who don't believe in Islam would say yeah but this is clean water I have no problem with my pet a dog licking it or drinking from it so I can perform although the answer is no Muslims do not do that though it is clean in your standards it is neji's in Islam's standards so the word clean water if we adjust it and change it into [Music] it has to be pure from nagisa water that would be better insha'Allah"
