  "title": "Bidah to recite Dhikr or Duas from the Quran during specific time or a specific number of times?",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, one of the treasures of Islam is the Adkar and the Dua that we find in Quran and Sunnah. My question is regarding the voluntary practice and whether it's Bida'a or permissible. For example, if I recite like a list of Duas from the Quran daily or if I recite La Khawla Wa La Quwwata 10 times or 50 times or 100 times or I recite certain Ayahs from the Quran as a reminder daily, not because I'm attaching any made-up or created Bida'a, innovated beliefs to it, but only because I do these things simply so that I can get reward from it and it is convenient for me. I'm not attaching any kind of made-up belief that if I do these things a certain number of times, certain things will happen. Is it Bida'a or is it permissible? It is permissible providing that you have fulfilled the conditions you've stated and you don't do it at a specific particular time. So if you insist on doing it every day after Fajr prayer or after Maghrib prayer, no this is a Bida'a. But if you do it throughout the day and without specifying 10, if you do it 9, oh I fell short, may Allah forgive me. No, you just make it 10, 20, some days 30, up to your preference. There's no problem in that, Inshallah."
