  "transcript": "an says eating seven dates a day prevents a person from being affected by poison and black magic is this Hadith authentic must these dates be specifically from Medina the Hadith is authentic without any doubt it was narrated by Imam bukari and Al IM Muslim in theah so it is agreed upon the issue of dispute is whether it has to be from Medina or not and whether it has to be from this specific type of dates which is date as we know dates have many species in them or categories or whatever types of dates so one is uh Kal one is Su one is this one is that so one of them is this particular one which is known as of Medina and the AA of Medina is a specific round black dates some people don't find it as tasty as the other types so the issue of dispute among Scholars whether this is an authentic Hadith no it is authentic whether it is specifically regarding AA or any dates from Medina or any dates anywhere else and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars does it protect from all types of poison and black magic islamically as Muslims we believe that now how this is none of our concern we believe in it because the prophet said it that's more than sufficient for us we believe him when he tells us that he received Revelation from Allah and we read it in the Quran that is preserved till date don't we believe him in something like this definitely we believe him blindly and wholeheartedly the question is do we have to eat it throughout our lives to be protected the answer is yes so if you miss a day then this day you've missed you might be afflicted by black magic or by poison but if you keep on having it the first thing in the morning seven in number not six not five it has to be seven if you continue to do this every single day you will be protected with the grace of Allah does it have to be from Medina as I said earlier it's an issue of dispute the vast majority of Scholars say that it should be from Medina and it should be AA but there are other hadiths where the Prophet said that generally such as the Hadith Muslim where he says whoever eats seven dates from whatever is between the two the two uh uh Hills or mountains of Medina which means that the whole thing of Medina because there are Hadith stating that it has to be from Al a specific area in Medina itself not any place then we have this greater Hadith stating that anyone would do from Medina and then there is some hadiths that say it it's just any dates so may Allah have mercy on their souls and as well state that they feel and they believe that any seven dates would do inshallah so if you are able to get your hands on Dat from Medina AA that would be a a a win-win if not then any seven days every morning the first thing you eat would do the job"
