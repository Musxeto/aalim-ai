  "title": "Reading Quran loudly in the Masjid & Disturbing Others permissible? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "instagram from australia says what's the ruling on some people some folks reading the quran loudly in the masjid this is a very unfortunate when you enter a masjid especially before jummah you hear sounds in the masjid as if it's a beehive everybody's reading the quran this is okay when you sit and the man next to you is reading surat al-qaf and the one to your left is reading the same surah and you can distinguish the words you can't read on your own it's difficult if it's not impossible the only way to counter that is to raise your own voice so that you don't hear theirs and this is exactly what the prophet saws prohibited he once came to the masjid or to a gathering of the companions when when they were raising their voices in order to hear themselves rather than being distracted by those next to them whether it was dua or quran or he said to them another way of saying it oh people take it easy upon among yourselves for you're not calling someone who's absent and deaf or far you're calling someone who is close all hearing and he answers you so the prophet prohibited them as some from raising their voices because it distracts and annoys those around you and he also said in an authentic hadith do not raise your voices against one another in quran because if i'm reading my quran i mean and you're next to me you're going to say alhamdulillah and i'm going to raise my voice so that i would not be distracted by you and this is not what the quran was made was was revealed for this is distracting people annoying people confusing people and this is totally prohibited you read in a voice that is sufficient for you to heal yourself he cannot know what i'm saying he knows that i'm reciting something but he cannot be distracted by that so this is permissible and not what the people are doing"
