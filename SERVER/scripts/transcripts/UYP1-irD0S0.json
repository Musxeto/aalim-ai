  "title": "Prepare your will!",
  "transcript": "foreign number five if I'm on my dying bed I have to prepare my will and actually my will should have been prepared long before the prophet is in the Hadith be pleased with him said it is one of the obligations upon a Muslim not to have two nights pass over him without his will written down by his head may Allah be pleased with a man with his father he said that not a single night passed since I had heard this Hadith without having my will ready one would say I don't have anything what should I do in my will well the writing of a will is complicated because your will has to have all the rights your rights upon people and their rights upon you so if I would like to write my will today what would I say I gave brother Abdullah 50 000 dirhams to um work in business with to invest nobody from my family usually men don't tell their wives anything especially about financial uh stuff and this is a good advice yeah you don't tell your wife anything about your Finance whatever she needs you you give her but don't tell her about your income don't tell her about your savings don't tell her about anything and she also must not tell her husband about this I have gazillion phone calls from men and from women in Saudi about this problem men abusing their wives taking their money building houses with their income with their income and with their savings and after the house is finished and it's my in my name I get married again this happens this is the normal scenario and likewise the women when they know that the husband earns so much and much out of their interest and love to their husbands they want more so I need to change the furniture I need to go to Geneva for a two-week summer vacation I need to change the car I need some jewelry I have a wedding to attend I need a dress I need this or that so it's always best to leave the finance separate so that shaytan would not come in now alhamdulillah if you and your wife are on common terms and you are very well together it's a different story I'm talking about generally speaking so that shaytan would not come in your will has to display these rights after your death so you would write I have 50 000 with Muhammad he's investing it I took 10 000 from my mother and my friend gave me 70 000 I'm paying 2 000 every month as in installments I have the car I have this so all Financial aspects should be covered now put it in an envelope seal it put it in a safe place so that no one would find it however if you change your will you must write that this will erases whatever comes before it because it's out of practice people come to us when their loved one has died with three wheels with his signature each one contradicting the other is there is no date so one says do this and they'll say don't do this it's not say well if you want do it if you want don't want don't do it which one to choose so you always whenever you write a will let it state that this uh uh abrogates whatever came before it and always clear uh uh the the date of uh the will and you are allowed financially to write a will of one-third of your wealth anymore no any less preferably pleased with him when he was ill and he had one daughter so the prophet came to visit him and he thought that he's going to die but of course we know that he did not die and he lived after the prophet saws so he said o prophet of Allah I have only one daughter I don't have any Offspring I don't have any boys and um I have money what is the share of the daughter in the inheritance one third half it is half it's mentioned in Surat and Nisa and head intense is one of the sciences that are the first to go so if someone dies and he has a wife a daughter and a brother how do we divide this the wife gets 1 8 the daughter gets half and the rest goes to the brother Jenny you know this of course anyhow so he said oh prophet of Allah I'm going to die so can I have a will of two-thirds of what I have the prophet said no he said half the prophet said no he said one third the prophet said yes and one-third is too much IBN Abbas says now let me please with him and that is why I recommend that whenever you write a will it does not exceed one quarter though it is permissible to have one third but it's best to have one quarter because the prophet said Allah one third is permissible but it is a lot so a quarter would be a much better choice for him so you can do this can I write a will for someone who would inherit me can I write a will to my father and say one third of my inheritance would be would go to my father no the prophet says there is no will to someone who is inheriting so I cannot write any portion of my money of of my wealth to my son to my daughter to my wife to my mother to my father they they are all inheriting by default but can I write one third of my money to my cousin yes to my neighbor yes you can write one third of your wealth to your Sheikh I'll be more than happy to accept that so this is permissible but you cannot give any part of your wealth as a will to someone who is inheriting you um it's so nice to have two witnesses of course nowadays in writing and proving or sealing it this also does this I think tomorrow we would have the brother uh uh the legal uh person to talk to you about the aspects of dying maybe you could ask him about how to authenticate I will hear uh we move on to number nine we've we've gone through this uh number 10. it is not permissible to be unfair or unjust in giving your inheritance or in right sorry that is in writing uh your will how would someone be unfair in writing his will in Saudi I don't know about you guys in Saudi we have a problem with our in-laws benefiting from the money we let we leave behind so a lot of the men would probably be unfair in the will to deprive their daughters husbands from benefiting so if I have daughters and they're married I've worked all of my life too gain this wealth of mind if I die portion of it would go to my daughter and hence their husbands would benefit from it and therefore I I scratched them off my will and this is forbidden a lot of the Muslims would do something to deprive their wives and that is why in Islamic law if a man on his dying bed divorces his wife his divorce is canceled why because why why are you divorcing area you've been with her for 40 days for 40 years says don't remind me I'm dying now and this is the only way I can get even without her punching me back so I'm dying she she holds his hand oh my love you're dying don't leave me said you're divorced he dies so the scholar say no no no this divorce is not applicable she inherits and she's still his wife why is he doing this he is doing this to harm her and the prophet Allah forbade from this harming people some people would exaggerate and write more for example we have people having three or four Sons the biggest son the oldest son is running the business of the father and the father loves him the the remaining three are useless to him so when he dies he writes in his will that half of the company belongs to my son this is not permissible being fair is essential in Islam because Islam is built and based on fairness I have two sons can I give one a gift and not give the other one an equal amount of gift do you do this a lot yes if your son if you have four sons and one of them is the the highest in grades uh and the first he comes in the first place in his school and the rest are normal do you give him something to honor him yes right you buy him a bicycle and the other three you don't buy them anything is this Fair no it's not is it haram yes it's Haram you can't give any of your children gifts and you have to be equal in them it's different when you're supporting them or you are giving them something uh to live by I have four children one in the University one in the high school and one the last one and then it is in uh Elementary School the one in the university has a car so I give him pocket money 50 Dirhams for example the one that goes to elementary school I give him four dirhams it's more than enough is this being fair no no this has nothing to do with fairness this has to do with what is needy their need but when I give them gifts for Aid I buy the oldest one in the University a watch worth of 2 000 Dirhams and the one in the elementary a bicycle worth 200 dirham accept it no this is Haram a gift you have to be equal likewise if you have two wives or more one needs a Caesarean operation for delivery I pay 20 000 Dirhams the one is lateral uh delivery three thousand dirhams does she call for the balance give me the 17 000 in cash no this is something different"
