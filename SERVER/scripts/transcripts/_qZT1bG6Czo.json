  "transcript": "ali from pakistan he says what's the difference between hafs and wash and this is a technical question and i believe ali asked me this question before on twitter and answered him and i think he sent it again to my website and i answered it but i don't know anyhow benefit of the doubt these are two different recitations so we know that the quran came down was revealed on seven and half is sighed and some explain it as an accent so it's a different structure of the word with different meanings that do not go against one another but rather they go in the same channel giving additional meaning to the word itself and there were seven ahrefs there were seven great scholars who were attributed to have structured and spread the quran according to their recitation they have taken it to uh from their uh scholars to the prophet sallam himself and hafs and wash are one of the disciples of these seven great [Music] reciters so hafsan asam al-khufi for example and so these are their two disciples who learned from it and we have it as we speak and ahmed from canada ahmed hi um i had a christian guy ask me this question and i didn't know how to answer so can i ask that question how would i know if i don't hear your question yeah ahmed okay okay um so he said in ayah i mean sort of 27 it says that the quran or the kitabs of allah cannot be changed and he said since the previous kitabs were sent by allah then how could we say that they've been changed or corrupted okay i will answer inshallah"
