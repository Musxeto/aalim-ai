  "transcript": "Sumaya from the Emirates uh can we send our \ndaughters to study abroad in Muslim countries and   settle her in safe environment without mahram \nwhile for traveling to and from from that   country she will be accompanied with the mahram \nis this allowed so the scenario is as as follows   I have a daughter and she would like to \npursue further studies in a Islamic country   is this permissible if the \nconditions are fulfilled   this is permissible okay what are the conditions \nSheikh traveling from point A her home country to   point B the place where she's studying has \nto be with a male mahram she cannot travel   she cannot board the airplane without a male \nmahram because this is sinful and prohibited   point two when she reaches point B where she's \nstudying she has to settle in a dormitory where it   is safe for her to study so it's segregated she's \nliving among girls and her needs are attended   there are people to bring her groceries or she can \ngo to the supermarket without fearing for herself   and there's no fitna point 3 that the school \nitself is not freely mixed some Muslim countries there are many relationships that are \nHaram thriving in such environment because   of the free mixing not abiding by the hijab \nfreely socializing with the opposite gender   if this is the case no I wouldn't send my \ndaughter there because I would be throwing her in   in fire so if such countries an Islamic \ncountry I know that in the classrooms they   segregate the seatings between men and \nwomen and they are segregated separated   then I believe that this is permissible without \nany problem insha Allah and Allah knows best"
