  "transcript": "Tea from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I understand this query won't be a one size fits all for everybody So for myself I'm trying to level up, gain some more qualifications and try to make it draw from the west A lot of the Middle Eastern countries they require qualifications and experience So I just wanted to know would I be sinful because of my tax payers money for example going to funding what's happening, the genocide against our brothers and sisters Would I be sinful in trying to put my eggs in one basket and try to move to the Middle East Or when there's other countries that a person can move to, the Gambia, other Muslim countries But if we're trying to work for the Middle Eastern countries then we can't get there And we overlook these other countries, are we sinful in this situation? There is no sin on a person who belongs to a Kafir country A country that he was born and raised in There's no sin in working there and collecting money and saving up money or working in trade or doing whatever he needs to do And this is not supporting genocide in Gaza or Palestine, this has nothing to do with that People are living their normal lives, has nothing to do with the genocide Now is it mandatory for you to migrate? The answer is yes Unless you can practice your religion freely without any negativity imposed upon your wife and children In terms of what they are exposed to in the society, in the community when it comes to Islam What they are shoved down their throats when they go to elementary school As they go up and how they try to condition them to their filth and to their wrong practices And to their deviant aqeedah and the likes If you are saved from all of this then you don't have to migrate, alhamdulillah Otherwise it is a must providing you can sustain an honorable, dignified level of life In that country you're traveling to, a Muslim country Whether it's in the Middle East or whether it's in Africa, whether it's in the Far East It doesn't matter as long as it's a Muslim country and Allah knows best"
