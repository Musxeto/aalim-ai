  "transcript": "can I have another question please be my guest at he brother I had my son died a few months ago and I was wondering if I could put little was he called sign in marble saying his name and I don't know this little sign likely to the plate in marble on his grave okay how old is he 18 18 may Allah accept him among the righteous and may Allah make Jenna his a'dope I would ask you any more questions are he okay Baraka laughing brother at the creams in the UK is asking about his son who died a few months ago he was 18 I pray to Allah Allah that he has forgiveness for this son and that allah azza wajal would make Jenna he's a dope and his home and to expand his grave and make it as far as and as he can see from paradise and I pray to Allah Allah that he substitute our brother Abdul Karim with righteous offsprings that would satisfy him and his spouse as well now his question was what's the ruling on putting ahead a tomb stone or a headstone like they do in Christian cemeteries where you have a piece of marble engraved on it born this date died on this date his name was so and so he was a beloved son to his parents etc this is totally prohibited I will hire Al Sadd one of the tabi in may Allah have mercy on us on him and her division was a Hey he said he narrates that I live now vitaly once told me should I send you as the Prophet had sent me to do what did the Prophet a son send you or Ali to do the prophets are solemn sent me and said to me do not leave a statue without or a picture without removing its features meaning it does not resemble a human being or an animal so if it's a statue it has to be destroyed if it's painting the face has to go so that it would not be simulating looking like a Las creation and this number two he sent me that whenever I find a grave that is above the ground to level it so scholars say it is prohibited to have any fence around the grave or any sort of structure or building or any sort of construction on top of it or putting a plaster around it headstones also is prohibited because it is imitating the Kafar one would say okay how would we know that this grave belongs to my father the scholars say that the Prophet is when earth man even mother owned may allah be pleased with him died he put a small rock next to it to his grave so that he would recognize it whenever he visits the graveyard so if you put something that is not as fancy as marble just a rock a piece of wood something that you write your son's name to identify it not to give it something to beautify it or to make it look nice then insha'Allah as a form of identification this is permissible and Allah knows best"
