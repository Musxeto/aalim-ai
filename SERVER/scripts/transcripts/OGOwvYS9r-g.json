  "transcript": "Al-Ban from Switzerland. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. May Allah reward you with Janatul Firdaus Sheikh. And you as well. My question is what is the ruling on praying with the shoes on? Because we work and we go to school. We often we go to the bathroom. The Prophet. Okay Al-Ban, listen to me. The Prophet Alayhis salatu Wassalam said in an authentic hadith, Pray in your sandals, in your slippers, in your shoes. Because the Jews don't. And the Prophet himself Alayhis salatu Wassalam, in many occasions, used to pray with his shoes on. And in one incident, in the middle of the prayer, he took them off. So all the companions took their shoes off during the prayer. And after he finished, he looked at them and he said, why did you take off your shoes? They said, you took off your shoes. We took off our shoes. He said, while I was praying, Jibreel came to me and told me that there are some impurities, najasa, on my shoes. So I took them off. Therefore, whenever one wants to come and pray in his shoes, let him look at them to see if there is any impurity or not. So praying in your shoes is a sunnah. Providing that the circumstances allow you to do so. So it's totally unadvisable to walk on the carpet of this fancy masjid, all the way from the back to the front with your shoes on. Because this is something that is resented and unaccepted by the people. But if you're at the airport, if you're at the mall, if you're at the street, if you're off out in the open, and you have your shoes on, pray with your shoes on without any problem, inshallah."
