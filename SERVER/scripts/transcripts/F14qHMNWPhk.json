  "transcript": "ASSA from india says that my flight is a 630 but the fetcher is at five o'clock so his child is asking what should we do okay as long as you're traveling from your hometown you are not allowed to break your fast until you leave the borders so let's assume that you are in Chennai and you are about to travel you pray fetcher you have your soul you eat and you intend to fast you pray father you go home you pack your bags you go to the airport you're still fasting once you are airborne then you can break your fast if you don't want to fast because Allah has given you the permission to skip fasting when traveling but not before because there's a possibility that you say okay there's no need for me to fast this day from the very beginning you professor you drink and eat breakfast and you go to the airport and they tell you the flight is cancelled the whole day so what why did you break a fast you did not travel in order to be allowed to break a fast so hope this answers your question"
