  "transcript": "says is it prohibited to celebrate eid after a relative's death the relatives mourn on reid rather than celebrating and people visit their house to remind them of their tragic loss is this per the quran in the sunnah first of all a person in islam is entitled to mourn the deceased what does that mean we're humans and we feel sorry for our loss when a loved one dies so islam permits you and i to mourn i feel sorry for the death of my brother or my father for more than two three years you mean that i'm sinful for that feeling sorry feeling sad is different than mourning mourning is to avoid things that are halal during the morning period so i'm mourning a deceased of mine i don't want to put any perfume i don't want to eat sweets or delicious food because i don't feel like it as a form of expressing my sorrow for the deceased this is permissible only for three days and nights after that this becomes prohibited why um may allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers when her father abu sufyan died she ordered her maid to bring her some perfume on the end of the third day and she put some of it on her hair and face and she said to those around her wallahi i don't need to put perfume but because i heard the prophet saying islam that it is not permissible for a muslim to mourn more than three days except for a widow mourning her husband for four months and ten days that's the only exception but you and i we can mourn people loved ones for three days meaning avoid putting perfumes avoid celebrations attending weddings uh eat celebration in this case only for three days so if your father died a week ago and today is eight you don't have the right to say i'm not celebrating eight i'm not attending weddings i'm mourning my father no this is haram you have only three days and that is it you"
