  "transcript": "Abduh from the U.S. Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, my question is, if someone does an act of Kufr, knowing that it's Kufr, and like having Iman in his heart, but he does it out of desire, does this take him out of the fold of Islam? Give me an example. Like for an example, he watches, he indulges in like comedy that is making fun of the religion, which some deem as Kufr, and he knows it's like Kufr, but he does it because he enjoys it, or he just has a desire for it. What is the way to repent for that? This guy is at the brink, because what we always answer in our website, that watching material that contains Kufr is sinful, and a major sin, but it's not Kufr. So watching material that has magic, that has resurrecting the dead, that has jinn, usage of jinn, and the likes, this is Kufr, to act with such things, or fortune telling, this is Kufr. But if someone watches it as a movie, or a soap opera, or reads a novel, this is a major sin, or sinful, but it is not Kufr, unless he believes in it. So one has to refrain from it. Now, saying that a person enjoys it, this is problematic. I don't dare to say that this is Kufr, but at the same time, I would refrain from saying that this is a major sin and not Kufr. How would anyone enjoy seeing Allah being associated with others, or someone knowing the future, or someone claiming to have authority over thunder and lightning, and claims to be the son of God, as in Thor, for example, who's liked by many Thors like him. This is problematic. To enjoy and to go all the way with such Kufr, I would hesitate in saying that this is a major sin and not Kufr, but I cannot say it is Kufr. Therefore, I refrain from commenting on this heinous and major thing, and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
