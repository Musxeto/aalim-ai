  "transcript": "Jade from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is, I live in the UK, there's a lot of Muslims here Alhamdulillah There's Madrasa, there's Masajid, there's option to homeschool your children as well But obviously it's still a Kafra country Despite this I've still got Inshallah, I've got attention to make Hijrah But obviously Allah knows if or when that will happen So my question is, is it permissible for what a lot of people do is They marry from someone in a Muslim country and then they bring them to the UK So I'm asking if this is permissible and would the ruling change if I've got the niyyah to make Hijrah or not JazakAllah Khair JazakAllah Khair First of all, the Hijrah is mandatory when you're unable to maintain your practice of Islam And the UK to my knowledge is the best country among the Kafra countries Where Muslims could freely practice their religion with lots of honour and dignity Alhamdulillah Unlike neighbouring countries, without giving names, the downfall is soon And everybody knows who I'm talking to Every country in Africa is hating their guts and trying to express their animosity to them Due to what they had done But, you wanting to get married, you send a proposal to Pakistan or to Bangladesh You want to get a girl to live with you and marry her This is permissible, especially when you have the intention to migrate And even if you did not have the intention to migrate, there's nothing wrong in that But is it the best thing to do? Personally, and after doing so many counselling sessions, I beg to differ Lots of the girls and the spouses, when they get married and come over to a Kafra country They flip, they change, especially when they get the passport And they become independent They feel that, I don't need this man anymore, I can live the dream and be free So, they don't know the culture, they don't know the language And you have problems with the spouse visa to get her over and if she has to work, if you have to work And then there's the exams and the Pledge of Allegiance and the whole nine yards If you take a local, from your own ethnicity, who's practicing, born and bred in the UK That would be much better And your life would be much easier And there's a lot of chemistry between you Unlike when you bring someone who's bored because she has no family She has no one to talk to in this strange country to her Lots of problems take place and Allah knows best"
