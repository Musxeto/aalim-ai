  "transcript": "a question somewhere it came to us is from ahmed from the uk is in tayammum is wiping over the hand okay or does one include the wrist or is the back of the hand sufficient well let us get the the the picture back again mum is as follows you hit the ground once there are two ways either to wipe your face and then do your hands or to do your hands then wipe your face and both are yani uh accepted in sha allah azzawajal this question came to us through um the live feed from youtube on uh zad channel you on youtube so this is sufficient but he's asking is the rest included or not we don't have a specific hadith that says it's included it says he wiped his hands so the hands ends at the wrist so do i have to do this area as well no the wrist itself you just do it like this it's and it's wiping it's not washing so many people ask the same question do i have to cover every single inch of it no you're not you don't have to do that all you have to do is just hit it once wipe your face and your hands and this does the job in sha insha'allah"
