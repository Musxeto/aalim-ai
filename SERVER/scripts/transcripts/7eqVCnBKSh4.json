  "transcript": "Al-Baq from the Emirates. First of all, Sheikh, may Allah bless you. Thank you for all your help you're giving to us. You as well. Wa Jazak. Sheikh, there is a question. If, let's say, a person got something because of personal issues in the past, and after a period of time, he realized or she realized, and now how is it possible to deal with that? Like how, you know, should the person drop everything, you know, the work or study or whatever? Or should he or she continue and just ask for forgiveness? Thank you, Sheikh. Okay, so if I understand the question of our brother, he's asking about using his connections and powers to get a job or to get a position in school. It's not what you know, it's who you know. So a friend calls a friend and they secure a job for me in a company or a position or a seat for me in uni. Now, after practicing, I realized my mistake. What should I do? Brother, if the job you're at at the moment, you're fulfilling the job description and requirements and you're doing your role in it to a satisfactory level to your superiors, then all what you have to do is ask Allah for forgiveness, repent and move on. You have no problem with that, none whatsoever, Alhamdulillah. And the same goes with your studies. But if you're not up to the job, so you're way below job requirements and you're not doing your job, you have to resign and look for something else and ask Allah for forgiveness as well."
