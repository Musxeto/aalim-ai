  "transcript": "[Music] and more rewarding for roman to wear is it the way of the nakap or wearing of the japan so muhammad's question if i understand it relates to what is more rewarding wearing the niqab or wearing the burqa and here we have to first of all understand what is meant by both definitions so that the name itself would not be ambiguous you may think of of something else than what i think that's why when you ask a question you have to elaborate is a traditional bedouin fast a face mask that usually is wrapped around the head with a shiny sort of forehead and a uh a pointed area that comes from the nose and with an opening of the rest of the face usually this is a burkhard so it had it hides the forehead the nose and maybe sometimes parts of the face but it exposes a lot of it and this is an islamic it has nothing to relate to islam is a cultural thing and it is different different from country to another the arabs the bedouins the in afghanistan and elsewhere they have different definitions of burka but it has nothing to do with islam is the islamic attire which a woman covers her face with and it is originated from the word which means a hole so it's a face cover that has specific holes for the eyes and that's why it's called nikab and this is the islamic way of covering and this is the one that a woman is rewarded for because it's an issue of dispute is it mandatory or a woman can't show her face the most authentic opinion which is i'm inclined to is that it is mandatory nowadays we have people trying to walk a middle path in their heads so we have women who cover their face but they're not covering their face actually they're wearing something similar to a burkhor so they show their eyebrows and part of their foreheads and part of their cheeks and they just hide the tip of the nose and exposing all of this area so the skin is visible the eyebrows are visible and a lot of the face is visible this is not a proper nipple when you have a nikab like this or like some people wear face mask this is not a nikop an actual correct niqab is when you just wear something that you can see through so you can't see my eyebrows you can barely see my eyes and the the rest of the face is covered this is the proper nihab and allah azza knows best you"
