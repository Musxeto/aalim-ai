  "transcript": "As you can see, I have reached the age of puberty with the grace of Allah. and my voice inshallah will carry me through the two sessions I hope and I pray to Allah Azza wa Jal both ways you're not going to understand what I say so it doesn't make a great deal a great difference but inshallah we will try to gain something out of these sessions so that when we go home we may fix what is broken if we have things that are broken so before we go into how to solve conflicts between the family we have to understand that the bond of brotherhood is the strongest of all and brotherhood is divided into three types or levels number one brotherhood through blood relations your siblings your brother and sister number two brotherhood referring or related to conviction and belief Allah says in the Quran but in the well minoana if we're really the believers are brothers and the third level is when you have a combination when your blood relations are Muslims and this is the strongest of all and what is the word kinship in Arabic now Sula is connection to connect kinship anyone a Rahim and when I want to underneath say they say so that or Rahim Silla to Rahim Rahim means kinship this is one meaning the other meaning is the womb where a fetus is formed in so the word Rahim kinship is derived from the womb and it shows that this strong bond is formed there imagine the Prophet says alayhi salatu wasalam when Allah created the creation creation, when Allah created the universe and was done with it, al-Rahim stood up. Kinship stood up. Is kinship a creature of Allah? Yes, it's a creation of Allah, like death, like life. So it stood up and said, oh Allah, this is the standing up, the position of someone seeking refuge in you from being severed so allah azza wajal said yes wouldn't it please you that i connect those who connect you and sever those who sever you ar-rahim said yes this pleases me allah said i shall do that and your prayer is answered so the issue between you and your siblings is not rivalry is not something that to be taken lightly it is something that may make you enter Jannah and it may make you enter hell the prophet said alayhi salat wasalam the one who severs his kinship will never enter Jannah whoa that is scary i pray five times a day i make umrah once a year i pay charity i try to do many good things but i have problems with my siblings well you have a problem with jannah nowadays we are seeing so many problems surfacing in our communities problems between the siblings problems that turned into enmity and hatred they have become real enemies we have case issues court cases between the siblings do you have it here we have it a lot in where I come from siblings they are filing cases against their own siblings not only that it cascades to their children so my children must not communicate with their uncle and his might must not communicate with mine and they're total strangers sometimes they live in the same neighborhood they don't talk for 10 20 years and if my son speaks to his cousin I will cut him off and kick him out this is shaitan's handiwork the bond of brotherhood is one of the greatest of allah azza wajal's favors upon us to feel the pain of your brother when he's tired when he's suffering to support him to give him the impression that your strength is mine and mine is yours your weakness is mine and my weakness is yours Allah Azza Wajal says in the Quran and hold firmly to the rope of Allah altogether and do not become divided and remember the favor of Allah upon you when you were enemies and he brought your hearts together and you became by his favor brothers subhanallah Allah is showing his favor to the companions that they've become brothers and this shows you the strength and the beauty of this bond so brotherhood and I'm talking about that between the siblings your brotherhood with your brother and sister from the same father and mother this is not a list of names found on your id card asim ibn luqman ibn muhammad even you no no no no the brotherhood is not a list of names it is not leaves in the family tree that we're proud of oh this is my lineage It is not a friendship that I can end and terminate when my friend betrays me or stabs me in the back. This brotherhood is not related to if you visit me, I visit you. And if you are kind to me, I'm kind to you. No, it's not like that. with your brothers and sisters the Prophet says alayhi salatu wasalam the one who maintains a relationship with his relatives only because they maintain a relationship with him is not truly upholding the ties of kinship the one who truly upholds those ties is the one who does so even if they break off the relationship the beauty of brotherhood is when you make your sister or your brother feel their value in your life when you make them feel that you miss them that their issues and worries are your own that when they cry and shed tears the tears come from your own eyes before it comes from theirs the real brotherhood is when your brother or sister is inclining and about to fall you're there to help them it's when you are their cane without them asking you to assist them you are siblings brothers and sisters you have been made in the same womb, drank from the same milk, ate from the same plates, lived in the same house, have the same memories, the same DNA runs in your veins, the blood it's the same. It is very important to know the status of your siblings not only for yourself but also for your wife or your spouse and children you have to draw a red line that is not possible to cross because the vast majority of problems between siblings are caused by the spouse and the children and they put fuel to the fire and they say no he did this he did that you should not have remain silent you should respond you should make a stand to it subhanallah don't allow anyone to come between you and your siblings and i mean anyone not a wife not a husband not on children all can be replaced not your siblings this dunya wallahi is not worth an hour of boycotting your own siblings. One smile, one SMS, one phone call, one message that you give salam to your brother or to your sister, it will demolish and annihilate mountains of hatred and enmity. One smile. it will fill his spirit with joy and with love for many many days to come you need to make the first step this is where shaitan stands firm no after all what he had done to you after all what she said about your wife about your children no this is shaitan the more you listen to shaitan shaytan is happy with you and he's pleased with you the bad news is when satan is happy and pleased who's angry allah is angry with you one meeting with the families wallahi it cleanses your heart it relieves you from stress and problems but you have to make the first step so this introduction was necessary it's a reminder for each and everyone don't look around people are look usually when we are reminded we look yeah he's sinful he's sinful he's sinful he's sinful what about yourself no no sheikh is not talking to me no you are the one who's being addressed revise your relationship with your siblings and and how shaytan has infiltrated your heart, filled it up with hatred, with enmity, with grudges. Would you like to see all of this in your grave? Shaykh, but he hurt me a lot. He did very bad things. Akhi, let go. Life is nothing. Soon it's going to end. one small piece of of peas can choke you and make you die one heart attack can make you die a stroke can make you die a car accident can make you die so many things so life is not worth it fill up your grave this is what's going to be inshallah a garden of paradise don't make it a pit of hell fire what are the reasons of conflict between the siblings Whoa, Mashallah. Good morning. Yes. What are the reasons of conflict between the siblings? Some researchers divide people into two segments. Below 12 and above 12. so if anybody is in this category forgive us so those who are below 12 why would they have conflict and fights main reason that we never ever suspect it huh what do you think yellow let us get you to interact so I can get a break and I don't speak huh as if I am getting it out good okay huh misunderstand 12 years of age okay yeah it can be hmm what else yeah he spoiled it yeah why couldn't you wait a little bit attention of the parents the vast majority between fights between the children below 12 is to draw attention of parents it's not about selfishness it's not about greed it's not about enmity or hate no no no I just want to bring attention and if I get this much attention is better than zero so they make problems they shout they misbehave and what is the solution definitely it's not preaching don't bring Sheikh Asim and say okay come and sit with my kids I hate sitting with kids to preach them mine my own I can but outsiders it they kill me when they bring me to conferences and say Sheikh you have a session with 12 years or 8 years of age what do you I'm not Yusuf Estes I can't do this I'm not good at it I speak with only teenagers and above those who have evil thoughts because I know how they feel pure souls are not my type are not my cup of tea so usually the best way the best and only way to solve such problems at a young age is what to give the children attention you have to give them quality time when you see a naughty child or a naughty boy disciplining them in the bathroom and closing the door for two hours only makes them possessed by jinn and then you come to me and say do ruqya sheikh i don't do ruqya even because i have so many jinn and demons in me i would be harming you if i do ruqya So the best way to discipline children is to give them love. Unconditional love. And this is something very difficult for us. How can I love them? How can I do this when they're naughty and not disciplined and not obedient? No, no, you have to. When you give unconditional love, you get love and respect in return. Children need to be emotionally fulfilled. and we fail miserably in this section especially fathers mothers by nature they're loving they're kind they're cuddly they love to hug and kiss and mush all the time fathers what's up you're cool okay yallah maasalaam the child is dying he's in surgery be strong don't cry huh this is how fathers are this is wrong your role model is who Muhammad alayhi salatu salam our prophet what did he do with al-hussain umama he used to hug them kiss them he would come down from the member of juma imagine giving khutbat al-jumaa and all of a sudden the sheikh whoa comes down and picks up his grandchild and goes back again what is this the prophet he says i could not control myself i saw my child my grandson walking i just out of love came and embraced him and hugged him and kissed him this is how we should treat our children how do you treat your children so many of us have problems and i know this is not my topic but yani who cares so many have problems when they especially the fathers they are so rigid and stiff memorize the quran you have to do this you have to do that instructions only no love no care no kissing no hugging no quality time and they put all the pressure on the poor woman poor mother it's your mistake it's you your arabic is not good you should have learned more arabic so that you can teach your son okay what about you i don't have to teach anyone i why would i learn learn arabic so subhanallah there is an imbalance it this is not good management so coming back again you have to give your kids unconditional love is it a valid reason to go and solve problems every time they fight no you're not the hague you're not security council and they are children every time okay sit here and sit here what's the problem you tell me okay no no no don't interrupt now you rebuttal it doesn't work like this so how does it work give them conditional unconditional love give them ice cream each individually and collectively let them feel that there is sufficient and enough love for everyone because if you try to break the problem and the issue and solve it you will take sides and the moment you take sides it's gone yes it doesn't mean that we do not reprimand we have to reprimand you broke his toy I'm going to take your toy in instead of his and this is one of the ways of solving conflicts the Prophet did this is thought was Salam how once imagine yeah he look at the Prophet is awesome this is for the men who consider them themselves yeah any real men male alpha or alpha male huh so many videos nowadays spreading between the youngsters I'm a male alpha. What male alpha? I don't know this but when I saw some of the weird ideas they have, this is un-Islamic. They're treating women as trash. This is part of being a male alpha. Look what the male alpha did, alayhi salatu wasalam. He was sitting with his companions in the house of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. Mother Aisha, it's her day. All of a sudden a maid comes in with a plate with food from the house of Safiyyah, the co-wife. It's not her day but she's sending food to the Prophet . Aisha saw this and a fuse was burnt. She could not handle herself. May Allah be pleased with her. She's young, she's beautiful she's beloved to the Prophet and she knows who she is she stood up in front of every other man in the gathering of course with a hijab from head to toe and struck the maid's hand making the plate fly and break on the ground and the food scattered the companions may Allah be pleased with them said and froze because whoa what has just happened this is too dramatic we've never seen things like this what did the Prophet say ala salam oh the calculations in our heads I'm a male alpha hmm I should beat her up no I should divorce her no i should make a stand how is embarrassing in front of all these men what did the male alpha do alayhi salatu wasalam he said to them don't worry don't worry your mother aisha is jealous it's okay sit down you can breathe he go alice or something he went and collected the food because the food is nama it's not to be thrown away and he collected the food and he said to Aisha, Aisha, I'm taking one of your plates in exchange for the plate you broke. End of story. Would you do this? Male alpha? Oh, I'm Bravo Alpha, Sheikh. I'm Charlie Alpha. I'm not this. No, no. This is how we should solve conflicts. With wisdom, with patience, with perseverance. But this is not the time. Okay, what about if they are above 12 years of age? What's the main reason for conflicts? Usually, it's violating the other's rights. In my home, usually the conflict is, she took my blouse. She took my shoes without my permission. She is using my stuff without my permission. and when you go and ask why did you do this what's the response two months ago she did the same I hope what's what's wrong and it's my father's money it's not her money he bought us this so if I'm using it or she's using mine it's okay now this is a clear sign of disrespect here is where the parents have to draw a line you remember yesterday we said the parents have to put ground rules in the house this is the ground rules that shows that you have a close-knit family without these rules it is like a jungle survival of the fittest who is ever stronger who's ever louder would live no here is where the parents have to step in and say no enough is enough you're not allowed to enter someone else's room without their permission you're not allowed to trespass on their privacy or take their things without their opinion or without their permission okay so let's go into conflicts our conflicts healthy do they have benefits or they're all pure evil everything in life has benefits even satan even satan has benefits even illness i'm ill this has benefits correct what's the benefit many and if i were to list them and speak about them this would take us an hour but i'll just give you headlines number one they erase sins so a conflict a problem erases sin it doubles your reward with allah azza wa jal it indicates that allah loves you and this is a clear sign when allah loves people he does what he tests them so this conflict is a test for you number four these conflicts they train you and purify your heart because it conditions you and teaches you and prepares you for the future it grants you number five the ability to be grateful so when that when a conflict takes place this is a test whether to be grateful or to be ungrateful it also conflicts pushes you to ask allah for forgiveness when problems happen between the siblings what do you do curse bang your head against the wall some I know listen to music as loud as possible what are you doing I'm stressful when you're stressful you listen to music it's haram or watch movies just to relieve themselves you're sinning so no it is a way for you to ask Allah for forgiveness seventh benefit is that it reminds you of the nature the true nature of dunya when conflicts happen you see how cheap and silly and trivial this life is and all what remains is with allah eightly it motivates you to repent and ninthly it shows you the favor and blessing of allah yesterday we did not have a conflict I did not appreciate Allah's favors and blessing now with the conflict subhanallah so how to solve conflicts when they take place first of all you have to pinpoint what the problem is you cannot solve any problem without identifying it and knowing the cause of it when it happened why it happened how it happened so you have to identify the problem and this is what most of us fail to do again yesterday we spoke about the headache a person with cancer suffers from giving him two panadols would not solve his problem it will solve the symptom so when you look at the symptom lots of shouting left lots of bickering lots of lack of cooperation these are symptoms look at the core of the problem and identify it then number two look for solutions because you identify the problem but you don't search for solutions and you may number three have a number of solutions but you have to choose the best you can't choose any solution in the battle of the trench or al-handaq the Prophet alayhi salatu wasalam and the companions in medina were attacked by 10,000 warriors from the tribe of Ghatafan and from Quraysh. What was the solution? Number one, let's go and meet them. Number two, let's stay in our homes and fight from rooftops. Number three, let's wait until they come. Many solutions were there. the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam studied all the solutions and picked one which was the advice of a companion it was allegedly Salman Al-Farisi to build and dig a big trench and he did this so he chose the best of the solutions and number four implementing the solution so many of us identify the problems they have the solutions they choose the best one but they lag behind and they do not implement it you need to solve the problems sometimes for a person who manages the problem and the solution sometimes you may not be the right one sometimes you need to delegate sometimes I'm too hot-blooded if I get involved I'm gonna spoil things so I may delegate it to an elder sibling I may delegate it to the wife I may delegate it to someone who is much wiser and better you need to look at the appropriate person to run the solution for this problem and one of the most important problem-solving solutions is you do not exaggerate we Muslims tend to exaggerate the problem sometimes it's a trivial issue we make it so big that Satan makes us depressed and worried because it you know what is a Najwa and Najwa is mentioned in the Quran in a man Najwa Mina Shaytan Leah Sunal Levina Amano Najwa is the secret conversation of two in the presence of a third when they speak together secretly and the third one is present with them what would happen to him he will become depressed and why he thinks that they are laughing and plotting and talking about him this is totally prohibited in islam if you are three in a car or in a room you cannot whisper in the ear of your companion without informing the third one allah says the reason to depress the believers so satan focuses on depressing you on making you sad on making you intimidated and this is why he inflates big things the vast majority of people who come to me for counseling they suffer from OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder and this only or mostly comes to people who are religious who are practicing they come to me sheikh last year i was a womanizer i used to party all night long i used to drink booze i used to do everything that is haram i never had a in my life the moment i started practicing and i stopped doing all of this i cannot even breathe why because Satan is trying to bring you down so he introduces this he introduces overthinking exaggeration this is what is happening when we have a conflict and always think of Allah's favors and blessing upon you that this conflict was not bigger Muhammad ibn was one of the great scholars had a pimple or a sore thing on his hand so it has pus it was swollen it looked ugly so one of his students came and saw it and he could see he was disgusted by it it didn't look good what did Muhammad ibn wasa do he said to him my friend imagine if this was at the tip of my tongue imagine if it was at the tip of my eye imagine if it was at my private part how would that have been horrible so alhamdulillah he said this student of his he said wallahi when he told me this I thought that this was nothing because when you see the big problems that could have been facing you compared to the problem that you have you see that this problem of yours is nothing we have a problem of exaggeration and as usual I'll always like to pick fights with the sisters the most people who exaggerate are the sisters why this is mentioned in an authentic hadith the Prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam all women folk give charity for I've seen you the vast majority people of hellfire said of prophet of allah why he said because you show your ingratitude in arabic kufr so they said do we make kufr with allah he says no you show your ingratitude to your husband if your husband is good to you all year round but he makes a mistake once you say I've never seen anything good from you. Subhanallah. And this is something that most women, not all, most women do when they're angry. So they neglect all the goodness in men, in her husband. Is it possible that she never had a good time with her husband? Not a single day? Nothing? No. but when she's angry this is what comes out of her now the sisters they say okay but sheikh men do this do men do this the men are saying no the men are known to be liars the men do this religiously we do this all the time the only difference is that allah placed a lot of burden on women more than men so if they do this they go to hell if we do this we will be punished but not as much why because we have more responsibilities than the women we have to work we have to provide we have to meet the people outside we have to suffer greatly while the sister is sitting between four walls yes it's boring but she's safe she doesn't have to go to bed worrying like me how am i gonna pay the rent how am i gonna pay the electricity bill they gave me a notice if you don't pay in five days we're gonna cut the power this and that okay what about the children's school fees what about this my father is asking me for money my mother says that i did not send her her monthly uh uh allowance while the sister they have problems mainly when I'm gonna do the the laundry when am I going to cook the biryani it's gonna be chicken or meat well yeah they have problems but the problems of the men are far greater this is why the Prophet said alayhi salatu wasalam in a hadith to prove that yes men do the same he says no believing man should hate a believing woman if he hates one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another so even men when you find that your wife is nagging i hate this in my wife yeah but she's beautiful she is a good cook my mom loves her because she's nagging she speaks a lot my mom loves people who speak I don't speak at all so my mom sits six hours with her chit-chatting I don't know what they talk about but she loves her and thinks of her the world so if you hate her nagging there are so many things you love be fair and realistic and sometimes when conflicts happen there may be no solution other than being patient there are so many members of our family who are born to be a nuisance they whatever you do they are hard to get by you cannot live with them they're always controlling they're always putting you under pressure they're always making you feel like you've done something wrong I haven't done anything wrong but this is how they speak to you so what to do there is no other choice for you but to be patient when khabab may Allah be pleased with him came to the Prophet alayhi salatu wasalam in Mecca complaining of his back being whipped and flogged and being tortured and he said oh prophet of allah wouldn't you ask allah to avenge us can't you see what's happening to us what did the prophet say the man is complaining what is the solution what do you want me to do i have no solution for you so the prophet said to him before you there used to be people like you and they were tested to the extent that a man would be brought with a saw placed on his head and his whole body is sawed into two divisions two parts and this would not make him reject islam and it would be brought to him combs of iron in his back the flesh would be calmed with a calm of iron taking the flesh oh mashallah five minutes okay i have an eye so and this would not repel him and throw him away from his religion what does this mean it means that i have no solution so some conflicts you do not have a solution for them except patience you have to have patience you have to have wisdom in dealing with your siblings in conflicts because if you are granted wisdom allah has granted you great favor and blessing allah says and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good this is not given to anyone the wisdom sometimes you have to accept the problem and divert it a man comes to the masjid in the presence of the Prophet as Islam urinates in the middle of the masjid in Medina what happened to the companions not angry outraged they wanted to go and eat the man in front of the Prophet in the masjid what are you doing you crazy but look at the Prophet as Islam's wisdom the man urinated halas it's done the harm is done if you go and interrupt him the guys go he's gonna soil the whole masjid but if you leave him it's gonna be contained in what a small area is it leave him leave him the man finishes go and pour a bucket of water on it and end of story come the man comes terrified after he saw the sparks coming out of the companions eyes and they said my nephew this is a beautiful word my nephew these places were not made for such filth they were made for prayer remembering allah reading the quran the man loved the prophet the most and he thought of him the most to the extent in the prayer when the prophet was praying the guy was making dua loudly oh allah forgive muhammad and myself and have mercy on us and don't have mercy on anyone else because of the way the prophet treated him now we have to win in in solving conflicts focus on the core of the problem why so many men come and ask sheikh my wife doesn't beautify herself for me this is a symptom look for the core of the problem go to the sister why aren't beautifying yourself she says he does not take a shower except once a month he stinks like a stunk a skunk he smells his mouth is always repulsive he doesn't brush he doesn't use miswak he doesn't eat mint okay when we spoke to the brother he was offended but he took care of himself and i told him you want yeah you pay peanuts you get monkey pay something expensive you get something expensive so he took care of himself he started shaping up you know taking care of his beard the beard because we don't put perfume in it we don't put shampoo condition it men of wisdom do this they take care of themselves one week later things have changed they have never came back I lost a hundred dollars but alhamdulillah we have a jur from allah azza wa jal beware when solving conflicts from resorting to haram sometimes one of the parties would not accept except by having something haram you cannot have this in order to solve conflicts it has to be an Islamic way of doing it start with the easy then go upwards in hardship don't kill a mosquito huh with a cannon the cannon would kill the mosquito and everyone else so when you have a problem a conflict don't start by okay I'm gonna kick him out of the house I'm gonna boycott him I'm not gonna speak with him for six years or ten years no begin little by little and then gradually go up and maybe you have to reprimand you advise you intimidate but when the last resort is to buy cotton you buy caught some of the parents do this I have a problem with my son I kick him out why try to use and likewise with the wife the wife is disobedient divorcer yeah he wait Allah Azza wa Jal said in the Quran that those wives from whom you fear arrogance first advise them one month of advising advising advising then if they persist forsake them in bed don't have any intimacy show them that you don't desire them and if they persist finally strike them lightly not with a basketball a baseball bat not from the very beginning boom no this is gradual and this is for the goodness of the marriage you don't beat a wife just out of the blue you have these instructions in the quran and the beating has to be in accordance to Islam so it has to be with a miswak that doesn't leave mark doesn't shed blood doesn't break a bone it's something symbolic to show her that you have reached the end of the rainbow if nothing is fixed then divorce can be resorted to we have lots of things to discuss but yeah who cares what they're gonna do they're gonna cut the power I'm gonna speak nobody's after me I'm the only one you guys don't have to eat breakfast so you have to also look for solutions outside of the box sometimes the solution is not in front of you and for example a man the Prophet tells us this is a hadith a man bought a property from another man when the man took the property he found a jar of gold what would you do it's mine I'm not gonna do it's mine I bought the man was so honest he went to the seller and he said okay I bought the house from you not this jar of gold this is yours that's stupid in our standards now what's more stupid is the seller he said okay I sold you the house with whatever was in it the jar is yours and they started fighting no I'm not gonna take it no you have to take it if I was there is it guys why fight I'll take it so what did they do they went to an arbitrator someone to solve the problem and the man thought out of the box what did he say he said to them okay do you have a son he said yes and he went to the other do you have a daughter he said yes he said okay my advice is marry the daughter to the son with this gold and make them live a happy life end of story this is an authentic hadith the prophet is telling us this this is thinking of the box don't always think it's black and white one is wrong one is right no sometimes you have to compromise likewise may Allah be pleased with him was a rich man he gave a loan to someone and that someone did not have money to pay back so Ka'b started asking for his money that's his right and the man said wallahi I don't have and they started shouting in the masjid so the prophet looked at them in the masjid he said what's the problem kaab said i gave him money long back and he's not returning it and the man says prophet i don't have so the prophet said how much is it kaab said xyz so the prophet said kaab take half of it and leave half and forgive him in half of the debt and he said to the man give him half of the debt caab said okay half is better than nothing and the man is happy because now i can afford half but not the full payment so problems can be solved but if we try to do this with a good intention and with loving one another wallahi we will have a good life and a good community I apologize I have so much material but no gas to take this vehicle away and the brothers are throwing me with pibbles so I have to conclude wa sallallahu wa sallam wa barak al nabiyyina muhammad Jazakallah khairan Sheikh Asim you"
