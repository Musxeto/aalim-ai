  "transcript": "and he is from nigeria uh i live in an area where many of the masjids people practice one or more of the following innovations and i'd like to know if my solar is valid if i bring this masjid and how to avoid these innovations what do they do okay number one they have a fixed time for salah they often pray before salah time is due abdul najib from nigeria he says that should i pray in a masjid that does the following number one they fix the prayer to a particular time now if the time they had fixed falls within the beginning of the salah time and the end of it so for example starts at 12 30 ends at 3 30. these are three hours if they fix the prayer time to be always at one o'clock this is permissible especially when people need to time their salat due to their work due to their schools due to their other things and they all agree that one o'clock is a convenient time there's no problem in that but if they fix the time before the actual time begins so they fix it at 12 15 when the adhan is at 12 30 or they fix it at 3 35 which is already after time you cannot pray there"
