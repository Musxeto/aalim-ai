  "transcript": "muhammad from india is the nadjasa on the floor purified with the passage of the time okay i will answer your mohammed from india says if there is an impurity on the ground and like after a month on the carpet it's dried can we consider it to be pure dancers no it cannot be purified by the passage of time it has to be washed unless the essence of the najasa has totally gone as in the case of a piece of najasa on the ground outside the house and after a month or two nothing remains no traces of it gone with the wind not the movie and it has no smell no visibility for me to see it there's nothing visible that i can see and there's no traces of it not whatsoever yes but a pool of urine on your carpet even if you come after one year it's still nudges and you have to wash this out and allah knows best"
