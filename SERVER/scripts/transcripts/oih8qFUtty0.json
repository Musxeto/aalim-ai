  "transcript": "Mona says what's the ruling on children watching cartoons we cannot stop kids these days due to peer pressure so what's the solution well if your kids come home and say that we would like to pick up smoking because everyone in the school smokes would you allow them dancers No so prevention is good providing that you provide a substitute so the current movies and cartoons like the Disney's and the likes of it these are all rotten and bad influence definitely it's a no-go you have to look for alternatives that are accepted Islamically that has a good message and does not have music and does not have any harm things you have to start to do your homework and inshallah Allah will make it easy for you"
