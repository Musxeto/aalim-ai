  "transcript": "[Music] j r can i create a hundred after one after the first then 30 or less minutes before fajr time the answer is yes fajr time has to advance one is about 30 minutes to an hour before the actual break of dawn and this first athan acts as a reminder to people who are praying to hatred be careful the adhan is round the corner so if you want to offer your witter then go ahead and it also reminds those who are asleep wake up it's time for sahur because the break of dawn is round the corner so there is nothing related to fajr you can continue to pray until the second event is called this is the break of dawn the announcements of the break of dawn where your tahajud is not accepted anymore and if you're going to fast you cannot drink or eat after this moment any more the difference between the two events is the second athan which is the break of dawn then has the phrases [Music] while the first adhan is like normal events of the day and night that does does not have these two phrases"
