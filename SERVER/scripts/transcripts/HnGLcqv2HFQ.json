  "title": "Etiquette and Guidelines when Asking a Sheikh a Question or Fatwa | SHEIKH ASSIM AL HAKEEM",
  "transcript": "oh nelly man from lebanon uh my question is uh what is the proper etiquette of asking like what manners must one adhere to uh this is very generic do you have any specific question that iman uh no like i mean if we want to ask a chef regarding a fatwa i mean i just want to know like from lebanon she says what are the etiquettes of asking a sheikh for fatwa or questions and nary man this is too generic so first of all you have to be polite so you must not criticize the sheikh what is this sheikh i've been trying to call you for the past six days you never answer or sometimes your phone is is not uh picking and sue me you have to be polite with the sheikh when you ask him secondly you have to be specific so your question is definitely out of the etiquette of asking a share and it has to be a question that benefits you not coming to me and saying what do you like ribeye steak or sirloin steak it's none of your business what is this this is fatwa we're here to chat ask a specific question you have to also give the background without prolonging some of the brothers and sisters when they call they spend like 40 minutes just telling me about their life story and then they would say so sheikh when i shouted at my mom was i sinful what does this have to do with what how you were brought up 40 years ago just ask me the question straightforward if i need any clarification i will answer you again part of the etiquette is to ask about real things so sheikh assume assume what did it happen no no let me finish did it happen no sheikh when it happens come and give me a call so you have to ask about something that is actually happening and not hypothetical assume sheikh we go to mars which direction should we face when we pray when you go to mars give me a call i will answer you inshallah not now so there are so many etiquettes of asking the share but i don't know this is what came up to my mind"
