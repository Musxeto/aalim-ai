  "title": "Do continuous regular Vaginal  Discharge impact Wudu? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] so ramla from saudi arabia she says in regards to when this is similar to maryam's question from the uk in regards to vaginal discharges if these vaginal discharges are the one that women all women most women know of and that they are continuous and they that they are usually colorless and scholars say that this is like sweating because it's not coming from the urine passage rather it's coming from where the child comes out from as they describe it so it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that these vaginal discharges as long as they're not a result of infection or an illness the usual vaginal discharges they do not impact your wudu and they do not impact your prayer so you can pray even if they uh if you see it and it does not have any impact on your wudu or your purity insha'allah"
