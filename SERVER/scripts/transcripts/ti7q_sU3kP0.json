  "title": "Borrowed an item but owner is asking for it back to do a Sin, if I give it back,  assisting sin?",
  "transcript": "Faisal from Canada I know we can't it's just anyone around any what if we're to uh like lend us something not a gift but just ruined it and then he asked her back to uh this was sin so like for example I would ask my dad uh can I you know use your car to you know go to a mall restaurant or whatever and then he gives me his car and the keys uh and then he 30 minutes to turn an hour later he calls me back asking for the car back because he needs to like leave for a wedding or something and without a doubt that the weddings could be pre-mixed and everything with music and everything and in this case would I be simplified if I give him a car back first of all logically you will not be sinful because he's not asking for your car rather he's asking for his own car to be returned back to him you are not his father you have no control over him to say no I'm not giving you my car so that you won't go to a wedding it is his car so this doesn't make any sense to borrow his car to go to a mall or to anywhere you want which he kindly allows you to then you want to reverse this and control his actions by judging him and saying that you can't go to such a wedding number two again you're judging your father saying that he's going to a wedding and there will be free mixing and there will be music and maybe Haram drinks Etc who are you to judge him you have no authority over him and you don't even know whether he will be participating in this Haram event or not whether he's going there to go and tell them this is Haram you should stop this this is Haram you might may not participate in this so he would do his communal Duty an obligation in enforcing what is righteous and virtuous and preventing what is evil and vice so you don't have the right to do this so in a nutshell my friend you cannot control your father you cannot decide what he does or he does not he's a grown man and he has the authority over you yes you may not assist him in Haram that is obvious and and clear when you have the ability to refrain as in the case if he tells you go and fetch me a bottle of beer or buy me cigarettes this is something how long you cannot do this and you have to hold your grounds and diplomatically and respectfully decline telling him that Allah has prevented me and prohibited me from doing this and I hope this makes some sense"
