  "title": "Do I lower my gaze if a woman passes by me, is attractive, or not covering her Awrah? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh, my question is regarding the gaze lowering that is ordered for men in the Quran. So considering I live in a Muslim country, so do I have to lower my gaze either every time a woman passes by me or is it only when I feel that I may be attracted to her or our eyes are not covered? Jazak Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum. Allah says in the Quran, Qul lil mu'mineena yaghuddu min abasarihim wa yahfadhu furoojahum. Say to the believer, men to lower their gazes. Not to not look because then you're going to hit the wall or you're going to crash. So you're allowed to look. We are the breadwinners. We go to malls. We go to the market. We go to the masjid. We walk in the streets. We may encounter women walking, maybe covering their awrah with proper hijab, maybe not. So Islam gives you the right to have the first gaze which is accidental, which is for the purpose of looking and seeing what's in front of you. So I'm walking. A woman walks. I look. She's a woman. I lower my gaze. I look elsewhere. But if I look again and check her out, turn down and try to see what is beautiful in her, this is sinful. Now she may not be attractive and I may not be tempted. This still does not give me the right to look and freely look because this defies the purpose of hijab. And this is why men looking at women is far worse than women looking at men. The fitnah, the temptation from men looking at women is far greater than Allah knows best."
