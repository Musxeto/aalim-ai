  "title": "Those who hate Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab",
  "transcript": "I'm asking you, do people nowadays hate our Prophet, our Muslim Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, do people hate him? No, not the Prophet, not the Prophet. Ya Akhi, I understand. How do you perceive me as a child sucking his thumb? I understood your question about Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab. I'm asking you to compare apple to apple, though there is no comparison at all between Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam and Muhammad Abdul Wahhab. I'm asking you, our Prophet Muhammad, is he hated by the Jews, the Christians, the Buddhists, and the likes? Yes or no? Yes. Okay, why? Because they don't follow him. Alhamdulillah. Now when you look at those who hate Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab, who are they? You will not find a single Muslim following the Qur'an and the Sunnah hating him. Money collection from the masses that they control. When they say, kill so-and-so, the mobs go and kill. Demonstrate, they come in the thousands and the millions. They want a shrine on his grave? No. Do we use his name to cure our illnesses and to get jinn out of people's bodies? No. He's just a scholar, and he's a follower of Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Al-Qayyim, and the great scholars of Islam. So people who hate him, simply hate him."
