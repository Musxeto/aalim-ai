  "transcript": "[Music] so he says that we know that the tahiti is divided into three types i heard someone saying that there is a fourth category which is the so is this true the answer is no this is not true the hidden is part of tohidu this is part of allah's specialties so as allah is the one who gives life and death as allah azza is the one who facilitates things as allah is the one who creates it is allah azzawajal who legislates so therefore it is allah azzawajal who has the right to legislate not that there is a separate tawheed of al-haqimiyah those who come up with this fourth category um is not um binding however to come and make it a fourth category and then build on it that whoever does not legislate according to allah's ruling in sharia would be committing kufur and would be exiting the fault of islam indefinitely without specifying without categorizing without explaining the different types of legislations this is wrong and this is unfortunately used a lot by the khawarij and some of those who are not attributed to the khawaris are affiliated with them but they have this wrong conception of al-hakimiyah therefore that of hate is free as you know them you"
