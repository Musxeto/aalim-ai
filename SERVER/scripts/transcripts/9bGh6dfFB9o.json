  "title": "Can I sit with NonMuslims (females) at lunch in school? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Dima from Germany. Salam Alaikum. Salam wa rahmatu Allah So my question is, if for example, I have permissible for me to sit with them and like break, like I don't meet them outside of school and like go out with them without hijab. But like at school, at lunch break, can I sit with them or is it not permissible? If you are in a kafir country, which Germany is, and you feel that every now and then you need to socialize, maybe give da'wah. So as long as you don't socialize with them outside of the school and the school is mixed, you shouldn't be there in the first place. But not everyone can afford or can find a way out of this, unfortunately, due to the fluctuation of iman. It increases and decreases. So those who go, they're sinful for free mixing and being in such an environment. But if you already in that position, you're not hanging out with them in the open or going to malls or to restaurants or the likes. Rather, you're just sitting with them at a lunch break. It's a chance for you to give them da'wah, to show them what Islam is, try to advise them. This is, inshallah, permissible if you don't free mix with the opposite gender and Allah azawajal knows best. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days and bi'idhnillah azawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi'idhnillah."
