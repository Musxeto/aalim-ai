  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the Emirates if a person who \nhas knowledge about a particular thing and if he   sins then he will be accountable but on the other \nhand if a person who doesn't have knowledge and   neither wants to have knowledge about a particular \nthing will he not be sinful okay so basically accountability is highly related to \nknowledge so Allah says in the Quran we Allah is talking about himself \nwe're not going to torment   a people or a nation till we send them a \nmessenger what is the use of such a messenger   so that he would educate them he would give \nthem knowledge because if the messenger   was not sent the people would say oh Allah \nhow would we know that this is prohibited and   brings your wrath upon us nobody told us so if a \nperson knows that drinking intoxicants is Haram   and he still drinks it he's sinful now what \nabout if a person doesn't know whether it's   Haram or not though he has the means to learn \nbut he gives deaf ears to anyone who wants to   educate him no no no don't tell me I don't want \nto listen why he said because if I listen I would   know and if I know then I'm accountable so I'd \nrather be in my ignorance not knowing the ruling   so that I won't be won't be held accountable \nof course you will be held accountable   looking the other way when you are able to \nknow whether it's Halal or Haram would not   exempt you from accountability those who could \nnot learn and did not have the means to learn   and had they known they would have refrained these \npeople are not accountable and Allah Knows Best"
