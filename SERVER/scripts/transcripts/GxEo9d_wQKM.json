  "transcript": "Jameela from U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sir. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Hi, so I work as an overnight nurse and I wanted to know, I had a 12-hour shift and I wanted to know if I do the three pools, would that protect me from, protect me during my shift? JazakAllah Khairan. First of all, to seek Allah's protection, Allah has given us what is known as the adhkar, phrases from the Qur'an, from the hadith that we repeat during the day and the night, so that we would remember Allah Azza Wa Jal. These act like antiviruses on our computers, they protect us, they form a high wall and a fence where shaytan cannot over climb or penetrate. And we say these in the morning, in the evening, after fard prayers five times a day, and before going to bed, and also before leaving the house. The three qul, which is chapter 112, 13 and 114, they are recited in the morning and the evening, three times each. So after prayer, and after asr or maghrib prayer depending, we recite them three times each. We also recite them before we go to bed, by cupping our hands, blowing in them, then reciting the set, ikhlas, falak, nas, then wiping over our whole bodies, cupping it again, blowing again, and reciting the set once again, and do it three times. We also recite it after each fard prayer, in addition to ayatul kursi. These are the three times we recite the three quls, and with the grace of Allah, in addition to other adhkar, which are found on the fortress of the Muslim, the booklet, Hisn al-Muslim, the fortress of the Muslim, which you will find an explanation of on my playlist inshallah on YouTube, and also on my website, where Allah graced me to explain the whole book, and when to say these adhkar, and the benefits of them, inshallah you will be protected with the grace of Allah."
