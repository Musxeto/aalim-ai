  "title": "Am I qualified to read tafsir of Quran on a WhatsApp Group, what if I'm on my menses?",
  "transcript": "Hello? Yes, what's your name? Assalamu Alaikum, I am Umm Amina. Ah, Alaikumussalam wa salam wa salam wa salam wa salam wa salam. I was mixing up with Umm Amina, Umm Amina from Saudi Arabia. Yes, what can I do for you? Umm Sheikh, I have made a group on WhatsApp where I have, where I, you know, upload the text from authentic Hadith regarding the female matters or regarding praying, your videos, how to pray. Now I was thinking that if I can read the Seer of Quran by Ibn Kasir for the sisters, am I an eligible candidate to do so? And one more thing, during my period, can I read from Musa reading, wearing gloves? First of all, if you are just reading what is in the Tafseer without commenting on it or putting your own views, yes, this is permissible. It's like any audio book. So you're simply reading the Tafseer that's there and you're not accountable for whatever right or wrong you're reading because it's a trusted book, generally speaking, the Tafseer of Ibn Kasir. So I don't see any problem in that, providing you do not put any info or any comments from your own if you're not qualified. As for your second question, you know that we only answer and entertain one question, but yes, if you are in your menses and you wear gloves and you touch the Quran, insha'Allah this is permissible. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
