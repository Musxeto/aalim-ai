  "transcript": "Hameed from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, my question is when performing Ruqya and reciting Ayatul Kursi or the last verses of Surah Al Baqarah, should we seek refuge with Allah from Shaitan at the beginning and also should we say Ameen every time we recite the Fatiha even when we are doing it for Ruqya? First of all, saying Ameen after the Fatiha is a highly recommended sunnah and if one skips it, the Fatiha is not affected. So it's recommended that you say it but there's no problem in skipping it. Second of all, you say Audhu Billahi Minash Shaitanir Rajim only once in the beginning and this suffices for everything you do afterwards and you don't repeat it before every Fatiha or every Ayatul Kursi or every Mu'awwithat. No you don't, you just say it once and Allah knows best."
