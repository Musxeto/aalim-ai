  "transcript": "her second question is that she wakes up late for Pfizer not only that sometimes it's too late that the Sun is rising or about to rise so what she does is that she waits until the Sun is fully risen and then she prays and she asks about the sunnah prayer first of all what you're doing is totally wrong and baseless the Prophet said Alice loves Salaam in an authentic hadith whoever forgets a prayer or over sleeps he must pray it as soon as he wakes up which may also means as soon as he remembers so these are two causes and two legitimate reasons a person forgot I'm in the office the event has not been called something wrong with the loudspeakers and I'm so busy answering emails having meetings I look at the clock and your Allah has a short time why didn't anyone call the advance it's not working or it called but I forgot so in this case I may pray the immediately it's not good to say okay as long as a sir has been called I'll pray it after half an hour or so no you have to pray it on the spot and someone who walks someone who wakes up late a minute or two for fetcher what to do the Prophet says he must pray it immediately so immediately you go perform Moodle and say call of nature perform Moodle and pray even if the Sun is rising no problem the prohibition of praying while the Sun is rising is for voluntary prayers not for fart fart is prayed any time of the day and night there is no restriction none what so ever now for the Sunnah if the Sun is about to rise which means that if you pray Asuna then you would have prayed the fog after the Sun had risen in this case we say no pray the fault first and then pray the soon afterwards but if there is like 15 minutes for sunrise there is ample time in this case pray the Sunnah first and then pray the fault afterwards so do not postpone your fart prayer by no means"
