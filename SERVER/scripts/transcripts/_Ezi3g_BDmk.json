  "transcript": "the next question is that uh uh actually it is a similar question from two sisters so i will try to combine it my husband is under heavy debt and he is uh suggesting that i should give my zakat to him that is from one sister the other sister is that my husband is under heavy debt and i have gold in my position am i required to give zakat under gold or help my husband first question uh is similar to second question but the second question let's let's start with it um who owns the gold oh sister it's you not your husband so it's the obligation of the owner of the gold to pay the zakat so sheikh i don't have an income all what i have is six kilograms of gold that's not fair six kilo grams of gold what are you talking about crazy you should sell some of it and pay your zakat on your own if your husband strikes as we say the arabs on his chest and says i'll do it honey it's none of your business alhamdulillah it's a gift from him but it's not an obligation now going back to the first sister if the deaths of your husband are legitimate he lost in trade he uh didn't have money to do this hello things as i'm not going to repeat again the scenarios the answer is it is permissible for you to pay off his debts from your zakat and the hadith is crystal clear zainab the wife of abdullah masroot came and knocked on the door of the prophet so bilal came and said the prophet of allah zainab is outside requesting permission to speak so the prophet said i use zawani which zainab there are so many of them so he said the wife of abdullah masrood so she came in and she said the prophet of allah my husband is stone broke and he doesn't have any money so can i give him from my zakat the prophet said yes so yes you can give your husband from zakat if he qualifies to be one of the eight categories mentioned in chapter 9 verse 16 surah ayah 6-0 there are eight categories mentioned in the quran that are the recipients of zakat if he qualifies to be one of them yes you can go ahead and give it to him"
