  "title": "Deviant Ulama & Fame Seekers assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "There's a good question regarding placing with the ulama who is more on the shubahat and more on the pro, not into the middle of the friendliness in Islam. So how do we deal with those ulama? First of all, the ulama who may be deviated and deviant and using other than the way of the Quran and the sunnah, the best way to deal with them is to ignore. The moment you reply to them, you give them status, you give them strength, and people say, oh, I didn't know this. Let me check his profile, his website, and they will learn from them. And this is one of the ways of bullying these deviant ulama. When you walk and there is a dog that would bark at you, will you fall on your hands and knees and bark back? If you're a dog, yes. But if you're not, you will walk away. So these deviant ulama want attention. They want prominence. They want fame. If you talk to them, unfortunately, a lot of the Muslims are looking for fame. People come to me and say, Sheikh, mashallah, mashallah, mashallah, you're very good in dawah. Pray to Allah that I become famous like you. I pray to Allah you never become famous. Do you think we like being famous? Wallahi, I wish nobody knew me. Wallahi, I wish that nobody knows me or think of me as famous. I don't want to be famous. So you ask or you learn knowledge for the sake of Allah, not to be a scholar, not to be a alim, not to be someone people watch you and follow you. No, you do it for getting close to Allah. If Allah wants to make you famous, yes. The vast majority of people nowadays, they want fame. So even duat, unfortunately, every time you go to their website, Instagram, this is me at sunset. This is me at sunrise. This is me eating durian. What is this? He said, no, no, this is for dawah. What dawah? Dawah is teaching people, and benefiting people. But you want fame. And most Muslims nowadays, they want fame. If they are not followed, they say things that is bad about Islam so that they would, people mention them. And this is very dangerous. It would take people to hell. May Allah protect us all. May Allah protect us all."
