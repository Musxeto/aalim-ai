  "transcript": "the things that do not invalidate would Woodill are numbered in the textbook with you number one is touching a person of the opposite gender so if a man touches a woman or vice versa this does not impact the woudl if she's a Muharram then this is no problem but if she's a stranger to him in an Muharram this is sinful but it doesn't break your wouldl the vast majority of scholars say that it doesn't break your would only Imam Shafi the chef Irie school say that it does break your rule and why is that well simply because the Imam Shafi went to the Koran and he found that there is an ayah which talks about Moodle and about hustle in Surat al-ma'idah chapter 5 allah azza wajal says i will a mess to Manisa imam shafi'i took this word and he said llama stone means to touch the vast majority of schools of thought said no no no this is not touching this deals with intercourse and this is what the sequence of ayat al will do yeah you Hal Edina MN you either come to Allah so Latif al cielo would you welcome the sequence of this ayah indicates that there are two types of ritual impurity major and minor the minor is lifted by performing Woodill and the major is uplifted by performing hustle in the case of inability to use either one using water for either one then you refer to dry ablution known as the mo and this ulamas to Manisa refers to having sexual intercourse and the other reason is that the Prophet himself are in salat WA Salam used to kiss one of his wives and he used to go to the salat without renewing his Woodill all of the zubayr the nephew of mother aisha smiled and said I bet she is you're the one who he used to kiss and go to salat without renewing his widow and she used to smile may Allah be pleased with her and this is a clear indication it does not invalidate your woudl the Sheffey must have followers don't see it this way and this is why it brings a lot of hardship to your life when you are going around the Kaabah in power and by mistake it is so crowded you touch women right left and center of course without your intention this invalidates your Woodill then what would I do know this hardship is not part of Islam having said that yes touching a woman shaking hands with a woman who's not muharram to you is a sin the Prophet said alisov some it is best for a man to be stabbed in his head with a needle of ayran rather than touching woman that is not permissible for him so this is not something that any one of us would desire or want once they know the consequences over that"
