  "transcript": "Fahmida from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Is it permissible to loan, borrow a device from a college or university for educational purposes? What is, what kind of device? That's a regular device like an iPad computer. What's, why are you asking? I, I fail to see the thought process that would make you doubt it. Uh, because, um, it acts that before you are enrolled in that current, in that specific institution, you cannot, um, borrow one, unless you are a student, then you can't. No, no, no. Fahmida, the rule of thumb is, as long as I'm not cheating or lying, as long as I'm not cheating or lying, if a university, whether I'm enlisted in or not, decides according to their policies and procedure to lend me an iPad or a computer and I use it in halal and I return it to them, there is nothing wrong in that at all. Again, the Prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam borrowed from Jews. The Prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam borrowed for one of, from one of the battle, battles from, uh, uh, a companion, Safwan, uh, the shields and armors to fight, if I'm not mistaken, in the battle of, uh, uh, Hunayn and, and so on. So there is nothing wrong in that, inshallah."
