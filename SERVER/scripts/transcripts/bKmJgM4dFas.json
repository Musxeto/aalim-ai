  "transcript": "abdul mujeeb from nigeria he says if i made a mistake in tasbih while praying behind an imam making a mistake in tasbih can be one of two situations i said subhanallah institute and did not say subhana rabbil at once twice three times and then i remembered that oops the wrong place wrong time so i rectified it by saying subhanallah in the first scenario this requires providing you are an imam or you are praying alone or you are a follower of an imam but you had missed one or more raka with the imam which means after salaam you're going to stand up and complete your prayer in these three scenarios you have to offer the sahu in the second scenario which is i said subhana rabbil but i remember then rectified it and said subhana rabbil allah this has no penalty no expiation you did the right thing there is no need for sujudis in any situation at all"
