  "transcript": "shabazz from india says you said that in your series the beautiful names of allah azzawajal that al-hamid is one of allah's beautiful names this is true and we said that it is different to al-mahmud because al-hamid does not require someone to praise you while al-mahmoud requires others so if others praise me i am mahmoud if there is no one to praise me i wouldn't be called mahmoud while al-hamid is one of allah's beautiful names that do not require creation to praise him so we know that there was a law and nothing with him there is nothing and allah is the one who created the throne the universe the time and and the place and everything we see so allah is the first without the beginning and he's the last without an end first without the beginning meaning that there was nothing with allah as he is independent he does not need anything so how do you say he's because he's praised by essence be that he and he doesn't require people to praise him now what happens with the attributes that are related to action such as coming such as descending such as um laughing such as getting being angry such as talking these are according to allah's actions so allah has always been described with an attribute of speaking and he speaks whenever he wills and allah azzawajal comes whenever he wills descends whenever he wills so he's described with it but it is related to his divine will and allah knows best"
