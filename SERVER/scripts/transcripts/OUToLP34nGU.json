  "transcript": "The next question is, sometimes while offering the Salat, I happen to forget the number of Raka'ah. What should I do in this situation? Should I continue or restart? It depends. If you are suffering from this in every single Salat or every day, this means that Shaitan is messing up with your head. Most people who suffer from this illness on a daily basis, they know what they've prayed. But Shaitan comes to the 5%. Maybe it's not the fourth Raka'ah, maybe it's the third. Deep down, I know it's 99.99% I've prayed for. But this is something that is, you know, scratching me from inside. I don't know what to do. Ya Allah, let us add one Raka'ah. This is Shaitan. But if it's normal, no, every day I'm fine. I have no issues. Once every blue moon, seriously, I am lost. I'm confused. Three or four, three or four. In this case, the Prophet says to those who have it once every blue moon, disregard the doubt. Where is the doubt? I'm doubtful whether I prayed three or four. Where is the doubt? The fourth. Because three, I'm certain I've prayed. But the doubt is whether I prayed the fourth or not. Disregard the doubt, number four, and add another Raka'ah. And then prostrate for forgetfulness before the salam. And that is concluding a prayer. So I hope this clarifies it a bit."
