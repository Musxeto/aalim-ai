  "title": "My wife's father passed away & she still has an unmarried sister, who can be her Wali",
  "transcript": "Is Misbah from Pakistan? Misbah? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh, my wife's father passed away and she still has a sister unmarried. Who would be her Wali then? When a father passes away, the guardian or the Wali of his daughter would be, number one, the paternal grandfather. Paternal, not maternal. The maternal cannot be a guardian or a Wali in Nikah, in marriage. If the grandfather does not exist, he's dead, then her guardian would be her son, if she has a son and he's an adult. If she doesn't have a son, her guardian would be her paternal brother that shares the same father or mother with her. And her paternal brother, who shares only the father and not the mother, in the presence of the full brother, cannot be her guardian. If she doesn't have any siblings, male siblings, then her paternal uncles would become her guardians. If she has no paternal uncles, then her paternal cousins, male cousins, the closest one to her, relative wise, would be her guardian and so on. If she has no one from her father's side at all, then the Muslim ruler or the Islamic judge or the one who represents them, and that is the authorized imam of the Islamic center, would become her guardian, and Allah Azza wa Jalla knows best."
