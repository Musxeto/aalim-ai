  "transcript": "Shifa from India Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum So actually I asked this question on Twitter but I just needed a bit explanation so my maid who's younger than me always keeps telling me lies and I cannot understand Shifa Shifa I cannot understand a single word of what you're saying So I'm telling that I asked a question on Twitter but I needed a bit more explanation You're asked about what? I asked a question on Twitter and I need a bit explanation about that My maid Okay Are you able to hear that me? I think I don't know let's see what's your question? My maid who's younger than me always keeps stealing and lying Your maid is the one who's always stealing and lying and you want to speak to her rudely so that she leaves the job because your parents don't want to kick her out is that the question? Yeah I also like I talk to my rude wife even in front of my parents and she even does not say sorry when she's caught stealing, she continues this I could not understand your the rest of what you're saying I could not understand your the rest of what you've said but again I said on Twitter that you cannot speak to her rudely or offensively because the one who hired her is your parents and they are happy with her stealing and lying so it's not in your capacity to take such a decision to make her feel unwanted by treating her in a haram way by cursing her by treating her rudely which is against our islamic ethics is not permissible and Allah knows best"
