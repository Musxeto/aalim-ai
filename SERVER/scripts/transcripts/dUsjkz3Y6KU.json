  "transcript": "fasal F up says can I pray over her soon after the fog well we know that the sin of the her is for Raqqa two plus two before the fort and two rakahs after the fog this these are the emphatic prayers there are another two records after the fall so it makes it four but this is that these additional two are not emphatic but if you do them you are rewarded so if a person misses the first four records or two of them for a legitimate reason he was preoccupied they did not allow him to leave the class he had a meeting which was urgent he forgot and all of a sudden the Akama was given there's no problem at all in making them up after the fourth prayer insha'Allah"
