  "title": "Is making fun of the beard or hijab kufr? (Mocking the deen VS Mocking the individual)",
  "transcript": "and it is important that we point out for those who always ask am i a kafir or not there is a difference between mocking the religion and mocking the individual these three were mocking the religion that the companions were following while if someone comes and makes mockery out of me and says awesome your beard is so long it reminds me of a disney character such a person is either mocking me personally for how ugly i look or he's mocking the belief that made me look the way i look if it was the latter then this is an act of apostasy making fun of hijabi woman or nikabi woman in general means that he's not mocking an individual rather he's mocking a ritual but when someone mocks me as awesome for having a long beard and he doesn't say anything else about other people's beards this is a major sin because he's mocking me but he's not doing this to mock islam he's mocking me as individual how i look how i act or behave and this is not blasphemy so it is extremely important because i get wallahi i get tens of questions every day you know that i answer on my website only 150 questions per day i wouldn't be exaggerating if i say like 10 to 15 of these questions sure somebody said so and so and i smiled am i a kafir why would smiling be a kuffer is it because this is acting upon an intrusive thought yeah but what the man said was not kofur it was a general remark a figure of speech i hope this doesn't turn into the flooding of news for one of the questions said in the garden there was water and the man was joking i hope this doesn't turn into the flood of noor said i smiled and then i thought of praying tawba and saying allah and having also renew my wife's contract whoa whoa hold your horses what are you doing siddhi ashik this these thoughts are killing me because you're allowing them to do so when you learn your religion and you know that this was not an act of kufu and smiling was not an act of kuffar you then can stop such intrusive thoughts with the grace of allah as a virgin you"
