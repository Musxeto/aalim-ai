  "transcript": "uh senna says my in-laws recite ayatul kursi and then rotate their index fingers to form a virtual hazard around the house and do his ar on loved ones for protection is this from the sunnah means besiege so as if they're reciting either kursi and doing this around the house and this around the loved ones and she's saying is this from the sunnah anytime sana someone asks you about something and is wondering whether it's from the sunnah or not you just simply ask them if it's from the sunnah show me the evidence from the quran or the sunnah if they fail to provide you with a hadith that backs this up did the prophet ever do it no then how can we do it and claim to be sunnah is there any origin of it no therefore this is a total innovation doing this after reciting to protect it from evil eye from whatever this has no uh basis in islam none whatsoever you"
