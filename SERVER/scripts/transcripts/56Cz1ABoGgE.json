  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] What can Allah Alhamdulillah. Dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode that deals with the issues pertaining to the heart and how to make it healthy by complying with the Sharia and with the teachings of our prophet sallall.aii Alai wasallam may Allah be pleased with a man with his father said that once the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam faced the people and that was when the rose for the congregation were being formed. So just before the salah started the usual is that the im says instructing the people to fix their rose. So the prophetat wasam said straighten your rose and he said that three times. Straighten your rose. straighten your rows. Then he said by Allah either you straighten your rows or Allah will create division among your hearts. This hadith has many many lessons to be learned. Among them is an etiquette where the imam before starting the salat the congregation prayer he makes sure that the lines and the rows behind him are straight and fixed. The vast majority of the imams after the he just says which is not the sunnah. The sunnah is for him to go and make sure and make certain that the rows are fixed and no one is ahead of someone else or no one is leaving gaps. And this was the sunnah. The prophet used to make sure that the first and the second rows were in line. May Allah have mercy on his soul in the fat. He says straightening the rose means either that they all stand similarly and in the same line or to narrow the gaps and leave no place for shan to come and intervene. Imam Nawi, may Allah have mercy in his soul, says the order, the instruction to straighten the rose or Allah will cause division among your hearts. In another narration in Bkari Muslim will cause division among your faces. This means I imi says that he will cause enmity, hatred and the discord of the hearts. As is said, this man's face is changed to me. Meaning that he is showing me something I'm not used to. He's treating me in a different way which means that his heart has changed because the difference and the division in not fixing and straightening the rose. This is something that is apparent, something that is external yet it is an indication of the discord of the interior of the heart. says otherwise there would Allah would cause division between your hearts in in another narration between your faces. Arabi says in this means or refers to your intentions because your intentions would differ. So when the rows are not straightened, this is an indication that your intentions are different from one another and the rows would continue to not be straight and the gaps would remain in the rows and be neglected until Allahawel tests these people with difference of intentions. One wants to go right, one wants to go left. They would never ever join on having one decision and would not never join to have unity. And this is what we see in the masids. Unfortunate when we go to the masid and we see some of the brothers tightening their feet together leaving gaps and when you come closer they go further. What is this arrogance? Is it neg something that expresses what in their hearts towards the other brothers? Why are you doing this? So my mhab says that I have to stay a little bit concealed and keep my feet together. This is not from the sunnah. The hadith, the authentic hadith says that we, the companions used to stick their feet to their brothers and stick their shoulders to shoulder, foot to foot. And this indicates the love they have in their hearts to one towards one another unlike what we see in the masid. may Allah have mercy on his soul says the discord and the difference in the exterior would definitely lead to the difference in the interior and when the hearts differ and go their separate ways then this is where when evil and corruption would erupt and appear may Allah have mercy on his soul says rarely you will find someone concealing something except Allahawel by time would expose what he has concealed on a slip of the tongue on the expression he has on the face and this is exactly what happens with the hypocrites so many people around us Muslims pretending to be people who care about Islam who care about the community, who care about the affairs of the Muslims, but you can detect in their tone of voice, in the expressions on their faces, in some of their actions that they are enemies of Islam and that they are genuine hypocrites. Allah says about the hypocrites addressing his prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he says and if we w if allahel w it we could show them to you we could expose the hypocrites to you and you would know them by their mark you would know them by the way they look the expressions on their faces but you will surely know them by the tone of their speech in the way they talk and Allah knows your deeds. Among the greatest dangers of the sins of the heart is that it shows on your body on your deeds. How many do we know among us from our own brethren, relatives, friends who do a lot of good deeds? Yet the benefit that they cannot reap from these good deeds were deterred and blocked because of an ill weed in their hearts. May Allah protect us. So whatever goes in the heart has to reflect on the body and the exterior and the deeds and whatever you do has to impact your heart. Allah says in the I am the most self-sufficient from shik. Whoever does something and associates others with me, I will leave him and his shik. And this shows you that boasting and showing off in forms of worship destroys and eliminates your good deeds. Something in the heart, nobody knows about it. But because you were showing off your intention was not purely for allahel Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala wasted your good deed also something in the heart arrogance even if little would prevent people from entering Jenna even though they have done so many good deeds that would entitle them to enter Jenna the prophet saidatam he who has an ants weight of arrogance would not be admitted to Jenna. Whatever we do reflects on our hearts whether positively or negatively. Abu ali may Allah be pleased with him says when people traveled with the prophetat wasam and they set camp they would scatter in different areas of the valleys so that each would have their own spot and privacy and they complained to the prophetat wasam that the food is not sufficient So the prophet addressed them and said to thematam being dispersed in the valleys like this when we said camp this is merely from shan immediately afterwards whenever they set camp they would join one another and be in the same area and spot close to one other. If you were to throw a piece of cloth, it would have covered them because they're so close together. So the prophetat wasam prohibited them from dispersing and being divided externally physically because that would indicate their separation internally and their hearts are not aligned. Similarly, what we see now nowadays when people eat, we have open buffets. People put their food in their own plate and sit alone and eat alone. While the baraka, the blessing is extracted and taken away. When you tell people come and eat from the same plates, no no no, it's not good. It's not hygienic. You have to put it in your own plate and eat alone. No, the baraka descends on it. say and eat. Yet people have this arrogance in them. They have this pride in them. They don't want to join others. The prophet said, \"You will not be admitted to paradise until you believe. And you will not believe until you love one another.\" Shall I tell you about something? If you do it, you will love one another. Spread peace and the word of salam. Spread salam. Whomever you see, assalamu alaykum. Why do I look at you when you're coming and I'm just waiting for you to start giving me salam? And if you don't, I'll ignore you and walk by as if I had not seen you. This is arrogance. And this would mean that we would never love one another and that we would never be able to actually believe and be admitted to Jenna. So we need to spread the word of peace. And that would cause love between the Muslims which is a condition of iman which is a condition to be admitted to Jenna. It is very it is very important that there is a collaboration and a huge relationship between what's external and what's internal in the hearts. Didn't the prophet say whoever skips three Fridays in a row consecutively Allah would seal his heart? What does the heart have to do with it? Because externally your deeds led to this internal change and shift in your faith and iman. May Allahel preserve us. We have a short break. Stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back."
