  "transcript": "Ali from Russia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Umm Sheikh my question is when we offer prayers, four prayers of Al-Fajr, Al-Maghreb and Al-Isha and we are the Imams for example and we pray loudly instead of praying Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen, is it okay, is it permissible to just pray Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem and the same question goes to when reading Quran. Yes it is, it is permissible to recite the Quran in a beautiful voice and to do Tartil is highly recommended but it's not mandatory. To implement the rules of Tajweed it is recommended but it's not mandatory. So if I read during the Salat, Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen, Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem, Maliki Yawm Al-Deen, Iyaka Na'budu Wa Iyaka Nastaeen, Ehdina As-Sirata Al-Mustaqeem, Sirata Al-Ladheena An'amta Alayhim, Ghayri Al-Maghdoobi Alayhim, Walad-Dalleen, Ameen. I don't say Dalleen, no I just shorten it, there's no problem. The Salat is 100% valid but the more you beautify your voice so that it would be appealing to those listening to it, the more reward you get because you are making people love the Quran."
