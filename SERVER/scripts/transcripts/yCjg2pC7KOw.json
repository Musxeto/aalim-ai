  "transcript": "Hassan from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Ya Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh I was asking about like we go to Jummah prayer, okay? I don't hear you, Hassan. Hassan, speak to the microphone clearly, please. We are supposed to go to Majid, right? In Jummah early, no? Yes. What if we go during the forbidden time, like when the sun is on the head, early afternoon, do we have to pray the Nafl at the time or not? Okay. First of all, the hadith that prohibits praying at specific times, such as after Asr till the sunset, after Fajr till the sunrise, and when the sun is exactly on the meridian, five to seven minutes before the Adhan of Dhuhr, these times of restriction are for voluntary prayers that have no reason. Prayers that have a cause and a legitimate reason, such as making up prayers, missed prayers, such as Tahiyyatul Masjid, when you enter a Masjid and you want to sit, you cannot sit until you pray two rak'ahs, such as al-janaza prayer, funeral prayers, such as any istikhara, for example, I have something of urgency and I must pray istikhara now. You can do this because it has a legitimate reason and this is exempted from prohibition at these times. For Friday, it's an exception. Because in Friday, a Muslim is recommended to pray voluntary prayers until the Imam comes and says As-salamu alaykum, which means that he must have been praying at the prohibited time. But scholars said that Friday is an exception from the prohibition of praying when the sun is at the meridian because of the hadith and Allah knows best. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah. Al-Fatiha."
