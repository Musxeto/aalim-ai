  "transcript": "we have from the us uh is the civil divorce uh or a divorce in writing considered to be valid from the us says what's the ruling on civil divorce and writing divorce in a paper these are two different issues and the scholars differed in their opinion so there is no one crystal clear answer to this but when giving fatwa is different than when giving a legislative ruling in a court and this is why the courts usually oversees the fatwa and implements it and has the executive to be implemented first of all second of all the issue of writing is a different of opinion simply because it is an ambiguous way of expressing so a lot of the scholars say that if someone was testing his pen and he wrote i divorce my wife this is not a divorce why because he did not intend the word for itself and he did not intend the ruling someone who is asleep in having a nightmare and there were people recording it and videotaping it while in his nightmare he said i divorce you my wife i divorce you i divorce you and he woke up said ah you're divorced now no it was not intended the words nor the ruling this is different when someone intends the words someone is sitting with his wife drinking coffee having a good time she said do you believe my friend her husband divorced her out of extreme love how crazy is that so the man says whoa if this is the case honey i love you so much i divorce you the divorce takes place i didn't intend the ruling but you intended the word for itself so the divorce takes place and this is the most authentic opinion now when it comes to civil divorce a lot of the people in america and europe they're only entitled for one wife which is with all due respect stupid because such civil laws limit limit the man to marry one woman but he can have 10 girlfriends no problem islam is not like that nevertheless so many people come to me and say i'd like to divorce my first wife only in a civil court and get married to someone else so that i can bring her over with a visa and give her a status of a wife green card maybe a citizenship later on the scholars say that this is totally prohibited why isn't it like writing it down no you are intending the words themselves you are filing a case in court to divorce your actual legally married and islamically married wife when you have four kids and after you get the divorce papers if you don't have prenup she has all the right to sue you for half of your property according to the man-made kafir laws and you would have so many things not in place such as inheritance so this is mocking allah's religion and for what from bringing someone else from out of the country to get married to her legally this is playing around you want to divorce your first wife divorce her both islamically and civilly in in court then you can reconcile with her later on one down two divorces to go or you can let her go but not play like this with divorce"
