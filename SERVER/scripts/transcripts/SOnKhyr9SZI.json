  "transcript": "my question for a young brother who wants to get married how can one love solely for the sake of allah and not just because i want to get married or because you want to give birth to children or for other things that's what you have a confusion because getting married is for the sake of allah no one gets married for uh not having children or not to fulfill his sexual desires or not to have a soul mate that he would have compassion and love and affection with nobody goes to an orphanage and say give me the ugliest woman the one who's uh handicapped the one who's and i would like to marry her for the sake of allah this is not how it goes the prophet himself stated that a woman a woman is sought after for her beauty for her lineage for her her wealth and for her religious commitment so opt for the one with the religious commitment or your hands would be holding into dust so don't mix apples with with oranges marry the one whom you feel satisfied with and make your intention to both of you reach jannah to al-fardausi and allah azza knows best"
