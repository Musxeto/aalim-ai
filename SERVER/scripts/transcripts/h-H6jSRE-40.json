  "transcript": "Faizan from Kashmir. May Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala grant you with best of His rewards for clearing our doubts. And you as well. Sheikh, my question is, me and my dad and also my brother, we all want to pray Isha at Majid, but our mother is alone at home. And also it takes more time. Today is Ramadan and we have to pray Tarawm. So what should we do? Okay, first of all, this is not something that is scary or your mom is so little that cannot be left alone unattended. If your mom was a toddler, I would say okay, there's no one to take care of her. But your mom is a grown up woman. If she needs to be attended 24 hours, 7 days a week, as in the case of someone who's bedridden and may face life-threatening issues if left unattended, in this case, yes, one of you has to stay behind. And this would not be only for Isha, that would be 24 hours, 7 days a week. But if alhamdulillah, she's only scared, there's nothing to be scared of, or she's only lonely, wanting someone to sit with her. No, this is not a legitimate reason. All of you have to go to the masjid and come back inshaAllah, and nothing will happen."
