  "title": "If I am a Traveler, should I join a congregation who is praying Isha and pray Maghrib later",
  "transcript": "the word from the Emirates um I had a question uh one time I was praying a name of Allah I was praying Salah and somebody had joined me I'm a resident where I was praying and they joined me and they were traveling I was training thought that Russia but and they had joined me as Salata after the prayer he asked me he said I I didn't pray spot in musgravia I just joined you predasha now what do I do my question I guess is if I was in this person's shoes what should what should he have done you know what I mean should he have joined me praying salatadesha and had the Nia from maglib or should he have done what he did which is pretty Asia and then afterwards as a traveler okay if you were in his shoes and the size is the same it is important to pray Maghrib first then Asia because the order of the prayers is something preset and prescribed by Allah azzawajal you cannot prayer then unless you've done this out of forgetfulness or out of ignorance or in a third case when the time is so limited that you can't pray that previous prayer that has gone and for example a person did not pray ER and Maghrib due to sleeping and it's about four minutes for Isha if we tell him to pray Lord and answer maghreb itself would also be missed he has already missed there are four minutes left for Maghrib time to be over in this case we tell him because it can be prayed on time then you make up for the and then you make up for Isha coming back to your question this person who is a traveler came to the Masjid found the people praying in Russia his order to pray Maghrib and he can do this in one of two ways the first way is if he's entering the Salat from the very beginning from the first raka that he prays the first three rakas with the Imam and when the Imam stands up for his fourth raka of Isha he remains seated he doesn't stand up for the fourth of because this is his last raka in Maghrib and he waits until the Imam finishes from his fourth raka and the childhood and salutation and when he offers salaam he offers salaam with him then he goes and prays Asha on his own the second format is that when the Imam stands for the fourthraka this Traveler remains seated to finish his the shahud his salutation and offer Salaam and stand up in time to join the Imam in Russia in the fourth raka of the Imam which is his first raka of Russia and when the Imam offers Salam he continues the second and the third to the best of his ability and Allah Knows Best"
