  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So basically there is this organization called Minajul Quran. It's some like organization that follows Barelvi group. Is it haram to pray in their mosques? Akhi, it is not what organization they follow that invalidates your prayer or not. What invalidates your prayer is the Imam. If he is a Muslim, your prayer is valid. If he believes in corrupt ideology that takes him out of the fold of Islam, then you cannot pray behind him and your prayer would be also invalid. Such ideology may include that the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam knows the unseen or controls the universe. Though he's dead, he's hadhir nathir and he controls the universe as he controls the palm of his hand. Or that he gives people benefit and protects them from evil. All these shirk thoughts and beliefs take a person out of the fold of Islam and you cannot pray behind such an Imam regardless of the organization they follow."
