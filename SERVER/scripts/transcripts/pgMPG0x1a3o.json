  "transcript": "sua from France so um as I'm living in non-muslim country uh so I want to be very cautious with what I eat uh so what ingredients should I look for while buying food items like pastries chocolates or biscuits other than gelatin and alcohol the default is that everything is halal until proven otherwise if you have the ability to check things that are dubious then you should things that are not dubious such as cheese such as bread such as biscuits the normal things that people have worldwide you don't have to read the ingredients of it as for gelatin we've discussed this before and said it's an issue of dispute and what I'm inclined to as well as a huge uh uh number of Scholars is that gelatin undergoes a rigorous process that changes both chemical and physical attributes of the substance that enters it so the end result would be something different than pork or dead meat or bones or whatever it would be totally different and this is is known as and hence it would make life easier for us to use it and Allah Knows Best"
