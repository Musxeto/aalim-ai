  "transcript": "Abdulrahman from the U.S. Abdulrahman. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh my question is what is more superior? Aff or Maghfira and which one and how to achieve it and where does the... Okay first of all you're entitled to one question and not a lecture Akhi. I don't have time to go into too many details and most of the time I don't have knowledge to explain things that I have not prepared. Al-Affu is greater than Maghfira. Maghfira comes from the word that is jointly related to Al-Mighfar and Al-Mighfar is the helmet a warrior wears on his head to protect him from the blows. So Maghfira is to forgive your sins so that you are not punished for these sins but it doesn't mean you're not going to be blamed for it or to be held accountable and then you will get the Maghfira. To pardon is a higher level where you don't even go to the extent of blaming someone or holding someone accountable rather you forgive and you let go and as if the sin did not take place and Allah knows best."
