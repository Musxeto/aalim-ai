  "title": "12 Rakahs Sunnah on Friday for house in Jannah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I've learned two very important hadiths, one in which the Prophet ﷺ said, and I quote, when one of you prays Jummah, let him pray four rakahs after it, end quote. And another that states that the Prophet ﷺ used to pray two sunnah rakahs when returning home after the Jummah. Sheikh, if I want to fulfill the requirement of having a house built for me in Jannah by Allah, by praying 12 sunnah rakahs every day, then in regards to Friday, do I have to pray both the four sunnah rakahs in the mosque or in the masjid after the Jummah concludes? And the two sunnah rakahs when I return home after the Jummah, to make up 12 sunnah rakahs in total during Friday, the other six being two before Fajr, two after Maghrib, and two after Isha. Jazakallah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. So to answer your question, the 12 rakahs that will entitle you to a house in Jannah are as known to everyone, two before Fajr, four before Dhuhr, two after Dhuhr, two after Maghrib, and two after Isha. Friday is exempted, it's an exception, it's not counted in. So yes, the Fajr, the Maghrib, and Isha remain as they are. The Jummah has no prescribed sunnah prayer before it. Rather, the prescribed sunnah is one of two choices. Either you pray four rakahs in the masjid, two, then after that another two, or you don't pray in the masjid and you go home and you pray there two rakahs only. This was the sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ, and it is, that is Friday, exempted from the 12 rakahs of the whole six days, the other six days of the week, and Allah knows best. you you you you you you you"
