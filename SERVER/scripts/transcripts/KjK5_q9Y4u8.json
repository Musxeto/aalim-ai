  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from the U.S. Abdul Rahman Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh, my question is regarding like working for like a rental, like a car rental company. Now what they do is they sell you like a temporary insurance for the rented car. Now let's say you don't have, let's say you're not forced by the company to offer them the deal. Whether they take it or not, are you sinful and are you sinful for working for them and offers insurance? Isn't it mandatory to have this insurance? No, it's not mandatory because people can use a lot of other companies. They offer like their own, like let's say you use the one you have by law for your own car and you can use that one for a rented car as well. Then there's no problem if you don't opt for it. There's no problem if they insist on having one. Also, there is no problem inshallah."
