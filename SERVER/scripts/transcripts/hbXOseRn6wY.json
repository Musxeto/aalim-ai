  "transcript": "Zahra from Sri Lanka. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. My question is that according to Shafi'i and Maliki Madhab there are different opinions about the duration for iddah when a girl get divorced by pasq. So is there any difference with the Madhabs that to be followed her pasq period? Is there any difference like how long? Listen, listen, listen Zahra. There is a difference of opinion in every almost aspect of fiqh. For you as a layman, for you as an individual, pasq which is annulment of the marriage contract has to be done by a Muslim judge, correct? I'm assuming you would say yes, correct. So if the pasq took place by a Muslim judge, he would indicate to you whether you should wait for three months, three monthly period, or one monthly cycle. And you should follow him regardless of the difference of opinion because he's the Muslim ruler and you're obliged to obey him."
