  "transcript": "so kalthum's second question was that if a woman if a wife commits adultery and she's not pregnant and the husband finds out either by her confessing to him or him catching her red-handed as they say in the cookie jar and he wants to forgive and pardon her is this advisable or he must divorce her this depends on the person it depends on the man see there are many factors that govern this situation Factor number one does he trust his wife and what she had done was a One-Shot in a lifetime a one mistake that he knows that she will regret till the end of her life and she doesn't know how she fell in it this is one factor the second Factor was it because of him and his neglect did he neglect her and was flirting with other women or was was occupied with his business and job 20 hours a day without leaving any room for her and her human desires Factor number two then there's the third Factor is he the type who forgives and pardons and forgets so that he could live the rest of his life trusting her loving her caring for her without bringing in bringing it up again or he's the type of a person who every couple of days or every couple of weeks he says yes you did this before I need to see your mobile I need to check on your emails show me your Instagram account give me your password I want to know where you're going take this GPS uh location decider so that I can know where you're going and when you're heading and also put this which allows me to hear what you are saying and talking to others hey if this is the case divorcer and let her move on with her life and live like a human being if you want to enslave her like this if you want to imprison her in solitary confinement while she's still alive living with you she's better off without you you're better off without her but if you know that you have a big heart and that it's a one time and you know your mistake and you know that this was shaytan it's a heinous crime don't get me wrong I'm not saying that she um smoked a joint for example no that's adultery punishable by the death sentence and your children can be affected you don't know whether they're yours or not shaytan can come but if you know that this was once in a lifetime mistake and you love her you trust her and you know how remorseful she is in this case yes if you can forgive that is much better insha Allah"
