  "title": "If we miss the Sunnah prayer due to laziness or traveling, should we make them up",
  "transcript": "We have Munib from the US. So if we might miss like emphasize sunnah from like a prayer due to laziness or traveling, are we supposed to pray sunnah prayers without prayers after that prayer? Because we do not complete the set of twelve. So, if I were to miss an emphatic sunnah, sunnah muakkadah, we know that there are twelve rak'ahs during the day and night. If you manage to offer them regularly, Allah will build you a house in Jannah. What are these rak'ahs? Two before Fard prayer of Fajr, four before Dhuhr, two after Dhuhr, after Maghreb, and after Isha. These are twelve emphatic sunnah muakkadah. The Prophet never left them, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, when he was in Medina. He used to skip all of them, with the exception of the two rak'ahs before Fajr, whenever he traveled. So, when you say to me that whenever I travel, should I make them up? The answer is no, because the sunnah is not to be made up. What about if I miss them? Whether I was lazy, whether I had a meeting, I forgot them, there is no problem in making them up, insha'Allah, if you had a legitimate reason. And if you did not have a legitimate reason, the reward won't be the same. But again, still you can make them up, insha'Allah. If you did not, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it, insha'Allah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
