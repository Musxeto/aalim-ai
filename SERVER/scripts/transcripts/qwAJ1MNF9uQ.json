  "transcript": "together so sometimes here when we go outside like we hang out maybe we go to a restaurant or something uh and it's late at night and we come back for example like 10 p.m or 11 p.m late at night if you want to pray isha then they said like one of them said like no we cannot pray together this is not from the sunnah like and we we asked him to give us the hadith to back up this uh this theory he said then he said there is no hadith there is nothing but it's just that haram is not allowed to pray i want to ask he's not allowed like to pray in communication that's my question no no this uh a statement that your friend has claimed is not related to islam at all on the contrary the prophet alaihis salatu wasalam used to delay risha until it was one third of the night has gone almost two three maybe three and a half hours after sunset he used to pray asha where everybody was asl almost drowsy and sleepy and he used to say by allah this is the most preferred time for it but had i not feared to burden my ummah i would have made it this time so your friend's statement is totally baseless and bogus it has no relationship to islam it's not haram and he has to fear allah azzawajal for speaking without knowledge if you cannot back up your statement from the quran or the sunnah or trusted a coats of scholars in this case refrain from commenting at all you"
