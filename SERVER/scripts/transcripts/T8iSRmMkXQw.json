  "title": "Is the reward for women praying Taraweeh at home MORE than men? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says is the reward for women praying taraweeh at home more than men or women who go and pray in the masjid behind any man the reward of praying the whole night because of the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam who said that the prayer of a woman is better than or better at her home better than even praying in my Masjid now this issue seems to cause a lot of confusion among among women first of all we have a reward that was given to whomever prays in the message behind the imam until he is over during taraweeh of Ramadan the Prophet said Alice a lobster in the human Parma my enemy had talents Arif he who stands in prayer with the Imam until he concludes meaning praying with her and giving Salam until he concludes his prayer then Allah would grant him as if he prayed the whole night so now we lazy men think of it in terms of calculation one plus one equals two if I prayed behind the imam for 30 or 40 minutes 11 records of taraweeh then Allah would reward me as if I prayed from Risha till Fajr that's one heck of an investment so we usually opt for it now this is for men and women however women are caught between a rock and a hard place so the sister comes to me and says share I want adjure I want reward if I go to the Masjid I'll be rewarded as if I prayed the full night but my confusion is that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said that a woman's prayer in her home is better than her prayer in my Masjid which we know that one prayer in the message of rubbed off of the Prophet as Sam it is equivalent or is better than 1000 prayers prayers elsewhere so now come on how to do the math first of all do you believe that your prayer in your home is better than the prayer in the message of the Prophet Isis I am she says yes so I said to her okay then what do you want she said sure if I pray home I have to pray at least three or four hours to compensate for the full night which I missed in the Masjid and I say okay why don't you pray in the masjid she said because the Prophet said is better to pray home well this is something in Allah's hands what I feel and I know is that if Ukraine the message it this is totally permissible and legit it was the Prophet himself erase awesome who said do not prevent women from attending salat in the Masjid he is the one who said that not only that his own wives used to pray in the masjid whether it was soda whether it was a shisha whether it was Zeynep they all used to pray the message with the Prophet I saw some and the Prophet had never told them don't pray in the masjid create your homes he's just told him what is best pray at homes if you don't want to it's okay so what do you say share I say that if a woman is so eager for having this reward and at the same time she complains that she doesn't have enough time during the night she has to care for her family for her husband she has to do the shores she has to cook she has to work if she is working in Dawa etc and all of this consumes a lot of her time and if she wanted to pray three or four hours just to get great rewards from allah azza wajal the night is not enough while praying one hour in the message it would compensate for all of that I would say it's up to her let her go to the Masjid but if a woman does not have anything to do and she's staying home without any obligations or commitment in this case I would say to her pray home and the longer you do that the greater of reward Allah will grant you as long as you anticipate the reward of not praying in the message with the congregation Allah Hodja knows best"
