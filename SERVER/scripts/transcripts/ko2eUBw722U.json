  "title": "Lender and Borrower BOTH owe Zakat ? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu It's an issue of dispute What I follow and I believe is that number one you the lender have to pay Zakat every single year as long as that individual has the ability to pay it and they're not broke Now I know my brother is earning and he has savings but he needs extra cash After one year I have to or when my Zakat is due I have to give Zakat on that 100,000 Why? I don't have it He's not broke he's capable of paying it and I did not put a time limit to it So 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, no problem I have to pay Zakat yearly Now if my brother took the 100,000 and stashed it in his bank account After a whole year of borrowing it if he still has the money or whatever is left of the money He has to pay Zakat on that What? Why would he? If the owner paid the Zakat why would he pay the Zakat again? Because the money is in his hand And when the Prophet used to send his officials to collect Zakat from those who have crops From those who have cattle, from those who have trades They used to come and check how many camels do you have? Give us X amount of Zakat Without interrogating them or questioning them Are they all yours or did you borrow some of them? They would take whatever is found and whatever they see This is why Zakat is due upon both and Allah Azzawajal knows best"
