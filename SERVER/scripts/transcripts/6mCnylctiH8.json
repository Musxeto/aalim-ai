  "transcript": "Kinser says in Pakistan when Nika has done the groom says cabal hi three times it means yes I accept and then the molana or maulvi goes to the girl and asks her then he says or she says I accept three times is this a Sharia based Nika I'm confused about ma lana going to the girl and sitting with her and asking her it is not Islamic correct first of all the Maulana in Arab countries that call him al zoom what is the ruling of having such a person to conduct the marriage Islamically these people do not exist this is an administrative issue related to bookkeeping registrar's but it has nothing to do with the validity of marriage marriage in Islam is quite simple the guardian of the girl makes a proposal not the opposite it's not the groom who makes the proposal in the marriage contract the Guardians the the girls guardian is the one who makes up the the proposal by saying I give you my daughter in marriage this is a proposal now the groom the boy has to give his consent and approval and he says I accept her marriage to myself and this proposal and acceptance has to be in the presence of two male Muslims or more by this the marriage has taken place the moon or the Maulana or the registrar only documents so whether he's here or not this is irrelevant it has nothing to do with the validity of the marriage now does he go and ask the girl when he has to register something he has to hear the acceptance of the girl himself saying the proposal three times in the acceptance three times is not from Islam this is part of what some schools of thought teach so that there would not be any ambiguity and the man would be certain the girl will be certain etc but this is not as part of the Sunnah this wonder is once the Guardian says I give you my daughter in marriage the boy says I accept and the girl's approval is inclusive in the sense that if the marriage takes place and all of a sudden they go to the girl's house and they say mabrook congratulations you're married now said nobody asked me nobody consulted me she has all the right to reject this marriage and deny it and it would be considered void no one can force her to marry someone she does not want but in 99.9% it's the father who goes to the girl and says we're going to make your marriage contract tonight tomorrow next week are you okay with this Mohammed is marrying you the son of Abdullah or so and so and she approves of it and she agrees to it Halas it's done we don't have to bring the girl in front of the witnesses and tell them or to listen to her and allah azza wajal knows best you"
