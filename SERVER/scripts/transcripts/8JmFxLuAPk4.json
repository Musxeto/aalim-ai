  "title": "Ghusl for wet dream during her period? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "So, the first question is from [Questioner], and \nshe is asking about wet dreams during the period. If a woman sees a wet dream during her period, \nbut she cannot see any emission due to being on her mensus, should she take a ghusl or not? The \nruling that the majority of scholars say is that water, that is of ghusl, is a consequence of \nseeing water, and that is the water ejaculated when a person has a nocturnal emission or has a \nwet dream. So, if a person sees and remembers and recalls an erotic dream, he wakes up, he checks, \nhe doesn't find any emission or ejaculation. In this case, we say to him, there \nis no ghusl mandatory upon you. But if the opposite happens, if he were \nto wake up not recalling any erotic dream, and when he checks, he finds a large spot \nof semen in his underwear or her underwear. In this case, we say you have to perform \nghusl. Therefore, if a woman on her period, she sees a dream, she wakes up unable to \ndistinguish whether she ejaculated or not due to the fact she has her period. In this \ncase, she's not obliged to perform ghusl, even if she remembers or she recalls seeing \nan erotic dream. Because the default is that she did not have one until she sees proof of it. \nBut due to the fact that she's on her mensus, there is no possibility of her to figure \nthis out. Therefore, she's not mandated, she's not obliged to make ghusl. But if just \nto feel comfortable and safe rather than sorry, she takes ghusl, that would suffice to uplift \nher major ritual impurity resulted from the nocturnal emission, but she remains on \nher mensus and she doesn't pray nor fast. And she doesn't pray nor fast. One says then, \nwhat's the use of having a ghusl? The answer is, because without it, you cannot recite \nthe Quran while in the state of janaaba, in the state of major ritual impurity. Once you \nperform ghusl, even if you're on your period, you can recite the Quran, you can read the \nQuran without any problem, and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
