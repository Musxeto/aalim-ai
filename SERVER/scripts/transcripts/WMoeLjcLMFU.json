  "title": "Make non-Muslim and grandma Happy on Christmas Day? Assim al hakeem JAL ï¿¼",
  "transcript": "Bekham from UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My grandma is non-Muslim and I'm taking care of her. She has strong feelings towards Christmas but I'm a bit confused. So what am I allowed to do when I see her unhappy on this day without intending to celebrate? Can I distract her with halal things? Organize a walk? I feel like trying to make her happy on this day will make me a hypocrite. On the contrary Akhi, what is prohibited for us as Muslims is to celebrate that day or to congratulate non-Muslims with it. But to be happy or to make people happy not because of that particular day, rather because they're depressed or it's your nature to make people happy, there's nothing wrong in that at all. Nobody said that this occasion we should all be gloomy and frowning and mourn one another. On the contrary, be normal and if you see your grandmother or any of your loved ones, whether Muslims or non-Muslims, being unhappy and you want to make them happy with halal things, not because of that particular day, rather throughout the whole year, this is totally permissible inshaAllah."
