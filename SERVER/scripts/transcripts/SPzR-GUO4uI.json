  "transcript": "Uzair from Bluchistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Can you give me some tips that how to focus on my studies when I am a student? Wallahi Akhi, this is too generic. People differ in their concentration. People differ in what pushes them to study. Someone who has a huge interest in giving da'wah, when he learns English, he'll master it in a few weeks. This is different from someone who's being placed in school in order to study English and he doesn't like it. So if you have the drive in you, and the belief, and the cause that you want to reach, why are you studying? To be an engineer Sheikh, to be a doctor, to be a teacher. Do you have this drive in you? Yes Sheikh, I love it, I adore it. Then you don't need any motivation or tips. Because this is gonna be your obsession. You eat, drink, sleep to study and to reach your goal. But if you're careless, you don't care, whether you get straight A's or a B or a C. If I get a D, that's good. You have no problem in that. Then this is not something that we have a magical injection or a pill to swallow, and then you will reach that stage, and Allah knows best."
