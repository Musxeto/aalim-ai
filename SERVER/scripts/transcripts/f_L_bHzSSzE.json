  "title": "A complete explanation about Fidya (expiation) for those who cannot fast | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sonia says how should the fiddler be given four missed fasts due to old age and chronic illness please explain in details can it be given to non-muslims can we give it in the form of cash can this be given to only one person for the entire month etc it was mentioned in surat al-baqara that those who are unable to fast must give expiation vidya and this vidya is to feed a poor person so the ruling is if I were too old I'm healthy I have no illnesses but I've reached an age where I cannot go on without eating and drinking for more than five six hours and then I fall really weak and tired this is age this happens or if I were chronically ill so I have an illness that doctors say your illness prevents you from fasting and this will go on forever till you die in either case in either case if I skip a day of Ramadan I have to feed as mentioned in the Quran however it has to be noted that the feeding for the missed day of Ramadan cannot be done during the day of fasting or before it must be done after the day is over so now time in Mecca is 2:30 p.m. if there is still about four hours and 15 minutes and 20 minutes probably or say whatever who cares for breaking the fast so if I'm skipping the fast and I say okay I'm giving fideya for today and I give the food to a person this is invalid what some of us does for their parents who are unable to fast so they because they come on the first day of Ramadan they make food for 30 poor people and they give it away invalid it has to be either after the day is over sunset or you postpone it until the last day of Ramadan even if it's ensure while after 8:00 no problem you can feed for the previous days what to feed the scholars say any food that constitutes a normal average meal would do so if we bring some bread and meat and give it to someone this is a good meal if we bring half a chicken with french fries and up on a bread no problem if you bring some Brioni some rice and some meat with it which is sufficient for an individual this is also valid if you wish you can give raw food of the main thing that the people eat in their community so like here in Arabia and in Asia you give one kilogram and a 1.25 a kilo and a quarter of rice this would do of grain of barley of wheat all of dates all of this is valid I shall upper one person can we give it all to the same person the answer is yes so at the end of the month I prepare 30 meals and I give it to one individual this does the job there is no problem in that unlike the expiration of breaking an oath because there it specifically states that you have to feed ten or closed ten poor people so I cannot give ten meals to one poor people they have to be ten different individuals but in Ramadan the Vidya can be either collected and given to one person or it can be one meal per person and I hope this answers your question one miss missed thing is can we give it in the form of cash the answer is no because the ayah specifically stated that you feed so feeding means that you have to provide with food because Allah stated that you have to feed them if you give them cash they might buy a shoe they might pay their electricity bill and this does not serve the purpose of complying with Allah orders"
