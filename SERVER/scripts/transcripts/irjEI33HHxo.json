  "title": "Is a Young or Old Step Daughter my Mahram & Why did Allah use 'young daughter' in the Quran",
  "transcript": "I said, according to one of your videos, you say that some scholars say that the word that Allah used in the Quran describing the stepdaughter that a man cannot marry is that of a young female. So my question is that, is that the most authentic opinion? The most authentic opinion is that a stepdaughter, whether she's an infant or a toddler or someone older or even a grown up female is a mahram to her stepdad regardless of the age when he married her mother. This is the most authentic opinion which the majority of scholars follow. So yes, a minute amount of scholars said that as described, wa raba'ibukum, meaning those who are raised in your presence, meaning a small child that grows up under your supervision, this is your mahram, she is like your daughter, you can't marry her. But what happens if I marry someone who is over 50 and she has a young daughter that's 30 years of age? Should I say that she's not my mahram, she should cover up? The answer is no. She's still taking the same ruling. So why did Allah mention the word of a young daughter in the Quran? Because this goes as the vast majority, it's in Arabic called al-ghalib, which means that the vast majority of men who marry women with children, their daughters would be at a very young age. Not the norm to marry someone with a 30 or 25 year old daughter. This is why the Quran referred to it, but that does not mean it cannot be cascaded to elder or older ages. No, the answer is still the same. So the conclusion, if a man marries a woman and this woman has a daughter of 20 or 25 or 30 years of age, she is considered his permanent mahram for life as a daughter and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
