  "transcript": "Zain says what do you recite behind the imam in a silent prayer and in a loud prayer in a silent prayer there is no ambiguity you have to recite Surat al-fatiha in each and every rakah as it's a pillar for you as a follower and afterwards you recite whatever you wish from the Quran as long as the Imam is still standing you don't sit there just listening there's no one to nothing to listen to you have to recite whatever you can from the Quran in loud records like the first two records of Feder of Maghreb of Asia you can only recite the fatiha and nothing at all else I'm talking about the Quran of course the inauguration Dora the other sifter I will install him in LA this is by default in the first raka but I'm talking about the Quran you only recite al-fatiha in loud prayer prayers and nothing else"
