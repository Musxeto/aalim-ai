  "transcript": "aasif from Saudi Arabia saying that I've been worshipping Allah so that for the past 17 nights and reading her and doing my Tala we trying to make Vicker giving money in charity but I don't feel the difference okay you're not supposed to feel the difference this is like someone hitting the gym for the first couple of weeks and we see this often people come and go and we know that this person is not gonna last for long because he keeps on fixing what he thinks is a muscle in front of the mirror and he did not at least stay six to eight months to see such a an improvement so likewise you need to devote a lot of time and be patient until you reap the fruits of Ramadan what do we mean by that thus Elif used to say I struggled with prayer for 20 years and I enjoyed it the second 20 years so the first 20 years I've been praying on time in the first row trying to have my submissiveness and kosher to the fullest I fail and succeed I fail and succeed but after 20 years it all turned to be good and positive and I have enjoyed it for the the second 20 years so now it's been 40 years since I have started bike wise in Ramadan we do our level best we don't know when the right moment will strike and our hearts were will illuminate with Eman and light we do our level best when you pray taraweeh with the Imam until he concludes it Allah gave you the reward of praying the full night when you recite the Quran and engage in Vicker and give money in charity Allah would uplift and raise you in the levels of Jannah you don't feel that now but you are in the right direction so keep on doing good deeds increase your recitation of the Quran try to devote time to learning the meanings of what you read engage in Vicker stay in the message more often so if you don't if you pray Fechter try to stay until ashraf and pray 2 rakats if you finish work in the afternoon and you go Margaret for example to pray try to stay until taraweeh in the message reading the Quran making dhikr stay after tear away for a couple of hours now we were approaching the last 10 nights of ramadan try to plan to do a decaf all of these things uplift you but when you allow Satan to mess up with your mind say what's the use I'm not feeling any motivation there's not much energy in my heart so oh what I've been doing is to waste might as well quit this is what Shaitaan is trying to do with you so be careful as if by and keep up the good work"
