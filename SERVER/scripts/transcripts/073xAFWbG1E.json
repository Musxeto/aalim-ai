  "transcript": "Lowering the gaze. So many times I walk in the market, in the streets, in the souk, I find a brother with a practicing sister, ma sha Allah, walking. And the guy, you know AWACS? You don't know AWACS because we're from Saudi, we know a lot of military stuff. AWACS is a plane that has a radar on top of it. And this flies all over and it controls all communication and it monitors anything that is flying. This man is like an AWACS. And whenever he sees a woman, he looks her up and down. And with his wife. A lot of the sisters call me. Sheikh, my husband is doing this and it's hurting me. Besides the fact it's a sin, it is killing me that I'm walking with my husband and he's looking freely to women. No. Part of his moral conduct and good character that he lowers his gaze. Because if you allow yourself to do this, then you might as well allow her to do this as well. Would you accept this? No. Why? I'm a man. It doesn't seem so. Being a man does not permit you to do this."
