  "title": "Suffering from Wiswas, 'Why don't you LEAVE Islam'",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from India? Sheikh, I have been suffering from waswas for more than two years and about my belief in Islam and they are too intense and when I say Astaghfirullah I can't even say it with certainty. When I say Astaghfirullah I don't have that certainty while saying it. My waswas are too intense. Why don't you leave Islam? Yes sir? Why don't you leave Islam? What's keeping you? I'm asking you, answer me. We did not take that literally and left Islam already and hung up. No sir, no sir. So answer me, why don't you leave Islam? Because I know it's the truth. Okay, and because you're afraid of hellfire and because you want to go to Jannah, correct? Yes sir. Now if the enemy of Islam, whether he's the president or the prime minister, comes to you with a glass of orange juice and he says, oh Muhammad, Muhammad bhai, drink this orange juice, it's good for you, will you drink it? No. Why? Because he's evil. Because he's evil and you know that he has definitely put poison in his mouth. He's poisoned. Now you tell me, will you come and say, Sheikh I have waswas. Muhammad bhai, who is this waswas coming from? Oh Sheikh it's coming from Satan, my fierce enemy. So I said, why do you believe him? How is it logical that you listen to him? How can I help you? Put earplugs in your ears? I can't. This is something you have to do. You have the belief that Allah is the truth, that there is hellfire you are afraid of. This is what's keeping you in Islam, because you believe. When Satan comes to you and says, no you should not listen to this, you are a kafir and you are a disbeliever, and you believe him, rather than believing your own intuition and your own strong faith, this is something wrong in your head. I can't help you with that. You have to draw the line and say, enough is enough. I'm not going to be a football that Satan tosses to his devils and they play around with me. I'm a Muslim, I love Allah, I love the Quran, I love Prophet Muhammad, I'm fully convinced with it. So enough is enough, you stop this and inshallah you will prevail. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
