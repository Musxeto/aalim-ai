  "transcript": "Fatima how to perform Moodle also with the bandage or plaster over the wound or on our body scholars say that I have to ensure that the water reaches the area in my Woodill process so I have to wash my hands and arms if I have a cut here and I have a plastic either I can remove the plaster and wash what's underneath it without any harm then this is a must or if I remove the plaster and wash what's underneath the healing process would be hindered and delayed or there will be more harm to the wound in this case it is prohibited to expose it leave the plaster where it is when you perform moodle if it's water-resistant then wash your hands and the plaster itself from outside and continue to do will do without any problem this is the same whether you have a planner or a bandage or you have a cast so let's assume my arm is broken from here to here I performed on moveable when I come to the cast I just wipe over it I don't wash it just wipe over it this is sufficient if I cannot wipe over it let's assume it's exposed and I can't have bandages on it try your level best to perform Moodle excluding that exposed area and afterwards perform tayammum for that area which you are unable to wipe over but if it is a bandage then this has no need for that analyzers or knows best"
