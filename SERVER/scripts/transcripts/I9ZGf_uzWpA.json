  "transcript": "Michelle says, which one is correct? Praying istikhara with the intention of getting married even without anyone in specific or praying istikhara when there is already a specific individual? First of all, istikhara is to be made when you're about to attempt something. So if there's no potential suitors, you do not offer istikhara. You do not pray istikhara wishing that someone might come like a knight in his shining armor. No, this is not valid. This is not istikhara that is permissible. The istikhara that is permissible is when a suitor is there or more, and you decide to go with one of them before the actual approval or commencement of the procedures, you pray two rakats and ask Allah if there's any good in it for you, that Allah facilitates it and makes it happen. And Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
