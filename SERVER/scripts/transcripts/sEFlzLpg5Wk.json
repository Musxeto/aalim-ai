  "title": "Are Photos or Videos of Women in Full  Hijab allowed in Islam",
  "transcript": "Edo from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Is it permissible to make pictures and videos of women in full face veil, fully covered, also the hands, and oversized thick veil from head to toe, shoulders are fully covered, and you cannot see the body shape or head shape? With all due respect, what is the benefit of such videos? Why won't I bring a sack of potatoes and video that and picture that? It doesn't make any sense, Edo. Unfortunately, women fall under pressure of peer pressure, social media pressure, and they have this urge in them to be filmed, to be photographed, or to come in public. But their iman, and their hijab, and their belief restrains them and prevents them from doing these things. So, shaytan drags their feet little by little, and they start to follow the steps of shaytan. So, you find Instagram pages of a niqabi woman, nothing, you cannot see a thing of her. But she's doing this with her abaya, and snapshot, and she posts it at the sunset, or at a jungle, or a garden, or a forest, or next to flowers. And you get comments, wow, beautiful, dashing, astonishing. Little by little, she exposes things that are not permissible. Wearing tighter abayas, maybe letting go of her gloves, maybe opening the eye in her niqab, the eye opening. Little by little, you can see some skin, her face, her cheeks. Little by little, maybe she compromises, and her face shows up, and the story is well known afterwards. This is not what a real Muslim woman would fall trap to. Don't compromise your religion. See how many scholars, da'is, religious committed people were, how they were 10 years ago, and how they are today. You get da'is, and quote unquote scholars, taking pictures with women, big smiles. Next time, maybe they'll hug them, and they would say this is out of compassion. These are the victims of a massacre, and I hug this woman, though she's not my mahram, though this and that, but I feel sorry for her. What is this? Remain steadfast on the deen. Don't compromise your religion. You won't get likes, and people won't recognize you just because you posted your picture on full veil. Nothing is showing, my shoulders are concealed, and my body shape is not showing. Might as well bring a sack of potatoes, and photograph it. There's no point of it, but this is how shaytan works. May Allah protect us all. Al Fatiha."
