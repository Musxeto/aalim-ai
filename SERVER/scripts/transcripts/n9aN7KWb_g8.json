  "transcript": "from the u.s um if i do something only because it's an obligation would i still get the specific reward that one would get for doing such a deed of course anything that you do because you do it due to the obedience of allah azzawajal you are rewarded for it so why do we grow the beard because allah mandated it upon us if it's not mandated i would have shaven it but because i'm doing it due to the fact that it's an obligation will allah reward me most certainly now if i do it because it's an obligation and i do it with compassion and love not just because i'm afraid of allah's punishment but rather a little bit extra edge over that which is i'm afraid of allah's punishment and at the same time i love it because it's a sunnah and the way of the prophet sallam i would be rewarded more and more for that and allah azza knows best you"
