  "transcript": "uh zohaib from pakistan my question is regarding the question as you mentioned some while ago that it is asked it's a question which is frequently asked to the scholars that you know someone wants to marry someone but his or her parents are not willing and that kind of situation of course according to islam you have the right to marry anyone you want but if him or her is a practicing muslim now the problem in society you see that someone wants to marry someone so instead of sending the proposal for marriage in case it's a boy he asks a girl he proposes her and then they start dating and then they say it's okay in islam you can marry with your choice but there should be a clarification that yes you can marry with your choice but talking to him or her before marriage is not allowed true this is the basics so what's your question my question is shaykh in today's society whenever you tell this to someone they say no we are allowed to marry anyone so okay i think i understand your question so zohaib is saying that sheikhasam you are encouraging men to marry whomever they want even if this requires them going against their parents wish but you never mention that in order for this man to fall in love with this woman they must have dated and went out and probably had premarital relationships and this is all haram this is a given we have no doubt in that such couple are sinful for just calling one another even if they never met calling one another and and socializing and chit-chatting is sinful because this is considered to be pre-marital relationship even if they haven't seen one another having a relationship through instagram or facebook like many people come to me and say i fell in love with this one woman for two years where did you meet now we've never met we just communicated on facebook this is face hell not facebook so definitely this is out of the question but the question usually comes to us after they had already gone too far so now we have a situation the man had crossed all the lines and he fell in love and they had a communication that was haram a premarital relationship now they've repented and they want to rectify things and get married they love one another the parents say no his parents not hers hers are okay with that so what to do if i tell him okay forget about her and he's man enough to do so and to move on with his life that's a win-win but the problem is that 99 of such people are already hooked and love is blind as they say and the guy loves this woman and maybe she's a good woman she repented and she became practicing why prevent these two lovers from joining in a halal marriage it doesn't make any sense this is what we usually mean and allah knows best you"
