  "title": "Zakat: Who is classified as poor or needy? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "my wish says can you please tell the difference between poor and needy the word used in al-quran is al-tohra for the poor and el Misaki for the needy and these two words when used isolated they mean the same like Islam and Eman when you say Islam is a beautiful religion then it means that including the belief in Allah in the books in the messengers in the day of judgment in everything else when you say you have to have a man in your heart which means that you have to have Islam Eman as an everything but when they come together Eman and Islam each has a specific meaning different than the other likewise when talk about 40 you say you give charity to the poor Halas this includes the Messick in the needy as well you should give charity to the needy this includes the poor the for Cara but when you combine them together scholars say that they have different meanings from one another so the most authentic is that the fakir or the poor is a person who does not find what is sufficient for him meaning that he has a salary on the 10th of the month he runs out of money so his salary is not sufficient except for ten days don't this what is a fatigue when you give zakat to him you give zakat to him that suffice as him for the whole year not for a one month or a week and you considered this that's sufficient no you give him what suffices him for a whole year so that he doesn't need anyone until the following year now L miskeen is someone who is a bit bit better so the poor may not find dinner a mask in a needy has breakfast lunch and but he doesn't have money to pay for his medicine he doesn't have money to take the children to school he doesn't have money to pay the rent though he has food unlike the poor who is totally stoned broke the guy doesn't have a thing at all so this is what the scholars say and how they differentiate between alpha T and L miskeen and usually the poor is someone the people do not know and notice and the miss keen someone is like us who lives with us goes to the Masjid looks ok but there are things that he needs though he has the basics but there are other things that he requires to live a normal life with dignity as explained earlier we have a short break"
