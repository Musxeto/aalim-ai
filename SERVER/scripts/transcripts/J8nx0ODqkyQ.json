  "title": "Eating meat slaughtered by Christians and Jews",
  "transcript": "sugar from us chef i had one question um okay so i heard that we can eat the food of the christians the jew and the muslims but then there's a verse that i saw that said that you can't eat any food that wasn't like that the name of allah wasn't mentioned in okay so like why would the christians or like the jews mention allah's name on their slaughtering okay i will answer you inshallah sugar from the u.s says i have a confusion between the permissibility of eating the meat which the people of the book jews and christians had slaughtered and the ayah in chapter five surat al-maidah do not eat from what the name of allah was not mentioned upon so i have a confusion why do you guys say it is permissible to eat what the jews and christians have slaughtered for us or for themselves as long as the animal itself is halal well this is very simple the answer is the issue of such permissibility and prohibition is understood by looking at all evidences from the quran the sunnah so it is true that if the jews and christians slaughtered an animal and we're certain 100 percent that they've mentioned the name of jesus the name of uh whatever the name of the president while slaughtering not the name of allah not saying bismillah in the name of allah then this is dead meat we cannot eat it whether it's a cow whether it is a camel a horse a sheep or whatever so this is something that is done and over with but also we know that in chapter five allah mentioned in the very beginning in the quran that it is permissible for us to eat the slaughtering animals slaughtered by the jews and the christians and here allah did not mention to us anything about mentioning the name so how can we combine the two quite easy you go to the sunnah you'll see that the prophet sallallahu salaam accepted the invitation of a jew woman who offered him a ram that was cooked and poisoned to kill him but he did not know that in the beginning so he answered the invitation he started to eat his companions one of his companions started to eat as well without asking the woman ahead of time whether this ram was slaughtered according to islamic sharia and did she say bismillah or not being a jew or a christian and being permitted to eat what they had slaughtered to us for us means that by default they either said bismillah and we accept this or they didn't say bismillah but because we don't know we give them the benefit of the doubt and we eat so this is the best way of combining the two evidences without neglecting one over the other so we say yes whenever a jew or a christian or even a muslim if a muslim wants to slaughter iran and says in the name of a tijani or sidney badawi or abdul qader or whatever a shadowy this is a dead meat even if he's a muslim because we can't eat from this and the jews and the christians are the same but when we don't when a muslim comes and slaughters a sheep and i didn't hear him say it from the supermarket i bought it from the butcher's shop so it is halal by default until proven otherwise and i hope this answers your question you"
