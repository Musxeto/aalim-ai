  "title": "Prohibition in Islam for a husband to come home Unannounced when returning from a journey",
  "transcript": "Among the beautiful etiquettes in Islam is that when a person is traveling out of town and he's coming back to his wife, if he's coming back at night time, he must not come unannounced. So lots of us come and say, okay, I'm going to make it a surprise. My wife is expecting me next week. I'm going to come tonight and surprise her. There's a prohibition. The Prophet ï·º said, do not do this. If you come at night time, don't surprise your wife. Why? Because she was not expecting you. And the norm is that if she were to know, she would have taken care of herself. She would have removed unwanted hair from her body. She would have combed her hair, wore her best attire, put her moisturizers, etc. Her body lotions, so that she would be in a presentable way for you. But when you come as a surprise and when she's not ready, you may see something or smell something or touch something that would make you hate her. So this beautiful etiquette shows that such surprises are nightmares and not a surprise. You have to announce that I'm coming at this time at night so that she can prepare herself. You also prepare yourself by having a shower and taking care of your hygiene, etc."
