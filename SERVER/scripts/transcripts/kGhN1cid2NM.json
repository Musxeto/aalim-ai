  "transcript": "Hamza says in Saudi Arabia when the congregation is over the late comers make another congregation is it from the Sunnah and is it permissible the vast majority of schools of thought say that this is permissible and they have a hadith that backs it up it was reported that the prophet alayhi salaatu Simon an authentic hadith offered fajar prayer and after they concluded their prayers a late comer came into the Masjid so the Prophet is awesome addressed his companions who had just prayed Fajr and he said to them who among you would give charity to this man by praying with him so one of the companions stood up and prayed with this man a congregation of fetcher for the man but it was a voluntary act of that companion so this is the vast majority of scholars saying that this is permissible there are some scholars who said that this is not permissible and they coated hadith from Anna's with Malik may Allah be pleased with him and I think either Abdullah my shoulder armor I forgot who went to the message when the congregation was over and each one of them prayed alone and not with his companions who were also late comers and they thought that this is an evidence that the second congregation in the message is not permissible and this is not correct because the instruction of the Prophet Allah so Salam and the prayer of the companion who had just prayed for in a second congregation is a clear indication that this is permissible of course this is not recommended but at the end of the day the second congregation is valid the third the fourth the reward is less and less and less but it is a valid prayer you"
