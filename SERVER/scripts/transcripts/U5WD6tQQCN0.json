  "transcript": "Barakat says what is the concept of halala marriages in Islam people say that if a couple is divorced then the woman can get married to another man with the condition that he would divorce her after a few days so that she can get married she can get married to him or to her first husband again this is a long story and I'm gonna make it as short as possible a man has the right to divorce his wife three divorces life differs from one house to the other and there are problems and there are tribulations and sometimes we need to divorce either for the goodness of the husband or the wife or for both of them but but also we may reconcile so Islam gives you three strikes strike one you divorced either she goes after her right the period is over which is three monthly cycles generally speaking now she's free she can marry someone else or not after a year or two I feel like patching up I call her or call her father and I propose he agrees she agrees we get married again few years later something happens I divorce her strike two now if we reconcile I have only a third divorce left and if I divorce her for the third time this is strike three our marriage is over and she is immediately Haram for me to even watch or see so she immediately leaves home she goes to her parents house and with total strangers I tried to patch things up I call can I we get married nope third strike so what to do the prelate else is in the Quran if this takes place she is not lawful for me until she marries another man and then after marrying him if he divorces her I can marry her again this is known as halala halala from the word halal to make her permissible for me the Sunnah brought us the details of this verse in the Quran so the marriage has to be a real marriage not with the intention to divorce the second husband in order to go to the first husband so a real marriage meaning that she totally forgot forgot about me I forgot about her a man comes proposes marries her and it is a must that they have they consummate the marriage so intercourse is a must so they get married they stay together for a week a year five years ten years and they live like a man and wife without any intention of making her halal to come back to me after some time they get divorced only then I can have a new marriage contract and marry her so what barakat is mentioning that I divorced my wife three times she is totally prohibited for me now so she brings a man from the neighbourhood listen would you have like would you like to have fun for three days and we'll pay you like 20,000 rupees why not so he does this and he goes marries her sleeps with her and after three nights or two nights or one night I divorce you then I get I marry her after she finishes her Aida this is an invalid marriage and the Prophet Allah saw some described this new husband as being a borrowed male goat that is used for breeding so as if I the man did not marry her for real he married her only to make her halal for me so he's a borrowed goat and it's an invalid marriage and it's totally prohibited and Alonzo Jane knows best"
