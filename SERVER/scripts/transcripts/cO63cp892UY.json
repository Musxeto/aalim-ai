  "title": "Can we make Masjid Renovators swear they won't use resources for personal gain? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Suad from the UK. Suad. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Sheikh, assuming one is renovating a masjid and some, those in charge, some of the people in charge are using the resources for their own personal use, are we allowed in Islam before the work starts to tell those in charge to make an oath or swear by the name of Allah that whoever misuses or takes this material for their own personal use shall answer to Allah on the Day of Judgment? No, no, no, this is not logical at all. If I want to steal or to cheat or to use the resources of the masjid for my own benefit, do you think I care if I swear by Allah's name? I wouldn't say anything. We have a saying in Arabic, and this is popular in Egypt, it is said to the thief when he's caught red-handed, swear by Allah that you did not steal. And the thief is told by others, Alhamdulillah, now you can go free. Because the thief doesn't care, he would swear by Allah. No, no. If we do our due diligence and we appoint and hire to the best of our ability those who are qualified and check all the boxes, then we monitor their work without asking them to swear by Allah or to innovate. The Prophet hired people, he never asked them to take an oath not to do this and not to do that. So we behave with all Muslims and believe them to be equal. And we trust them. If we see something that breaches this trust, yes, then we take action. And Allah knows best."
