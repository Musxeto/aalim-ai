  "transcript": "a smile says what is considered to be part of the beard and what is not can I remove the hair under my neck and below my lower lip what about the earlobes first of all last week we spoke about this and I think I've answered a similar question the beard is the hair that grows on your lower jaw and your cheeks so this is your beard your cheekbones that are under your eyes are not your bead so you can shave this and remove it but this is the lower jaw line what's underneath your beard which is the neck this is not your beard so it is permissible whatever is below your chin meaning the chin is the line the end and then you get the neck whatever is in your neck then you can shave this or remove it or cut it short if you wish there's no problem this area which is B low the lower lip - Napa they call it this is an issue of dispute some scholars say that it is part of the beard others say that it is not part of the beard I personally believe that it is not part of the beard and shortening it or removing it is up to the individual definitely the ear loops are not from the jaw and hence any hair that grows if there is a possibility of hair growing there can be removed without any problem insha Allah who as widget"
