  "title": "ğŸ†• Watching Sports (cricket or football) with Music and Cheerleaders? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "so our first question is from Abdul uhÂ \nAbdul muid, he says is it permissible toÂ Â  watch sports like Cricket,football, etc,Â \nwhere there is music and cheerleaders?Â Â  First of all the default is that it is notÂ \npermissible to watch anything that includes HaramÂ Â  so, in essence football, Cricket,Â \nbasketball, volleyball, squash, tennis,Â Â  all these sports are in essence Halal toÂ \npractice if there is no Haram in it involved.Â Â  Watching football, if it includes listening toÂ \nmusic or cheerleaders which I don't know whereÂ Â  that could be because usually cheerleaders areÂ \nassociated with other sports such as basketball,Â Â  etc hypothetically speaking, if there were,Â \nor any other Haram activities then watchingÂ Â  football becomes Haram. Ff someone saysÂ \nI will not listen to music, there is noÂ Â  music in football there's only players runningÂ \nafter a ball full of air, and fighting over it,Â Â  so there is nothing Haram and such music orÂ \ncheerleaders, yes but is their exposure of awraatÂ Â  like the exposure of thighs? The answer is mostÂ \nof the players cover their whole thigh with theseÂ Â  leggings or with these warm-up suits or whatever,Â \nand then they wear their shorts on top of that soÂ Â  usually it's not exposed. If this is the case andÂ \nif it is once every blue moon there is no problemÂ Â  in watching it inshallah. Cricket, there's noÂ \nproblem in watching it because they're decentlyÂ Â  dressed I don't know I haven't seen any of theseÂ \nmatches but usually I don't think there is uh anyÂ Â  uh Haram activities such as music or cheerleadersÂ \nor their likes. BUT - is the time of a MuslimÂ Â  that cheap to be wasted on such things? YouÂ \nknow the steps of Shaytan are, one by one,Â Â  so he's pulling your legs. So you spend 10Â \nminutes watching a clip a couple of weeksÂ Â  later it's half an hour a couple of weeks laterÂ \nit's the full match. Cricket matches take what,Â Â  four hours five hours? I don't know, and itÂ \nbecomes an obsession. I've heard people spendingÂ Â  three four hours till before FajrÂ \nand missing Fajr prayer because ofÂ Â  the U.S open or tennis tournament and it'sÂ \neven worse when grown-up men watch WOMENÂ Â  playing sports, and talking casually about it,Â \n'Oh this player is better than that player or thisÂ Â  Tunisian Arab woman was almost going to win inÂ \nWimbledon' Akhi, you're talking as if it's okay?Â Â  There's nothing Haram? Where is Islam in all ofÂ \nthis? Is Allah pleased with what you're doing? AndÂ Â  talking about openly? Definitely this is all partÂ \nof the steps of Shaytan that we are so indulged inÂ Â  we don't pay any attention so we go back to theÂ \nbasics. Ideally as a Muslim, I do not encourageÂ Â  you to watch football or Cricket or whatever, goÂ \nand practice it Akhi! Go and play be a sportsman,Â Â  be an athlete, be someone who's active! SittingÂ \non your backside watching for two three hoursÂ Â  people playing sports and exerting effort andÂ \nafter you finish and eating popcorn and softÂ Â  drinks you're gonna have a shower becauseÂ \nyou sweat a lot this is not logical andÂ Â  it's inappropriate for a Muslim this time if itÂ \nwas dedicated to reading the Quran, to prayer,Â Â  to learning your religion, - in six months timeÂ \nyou would have been in my seat giving fatwas"
