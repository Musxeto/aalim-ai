  "title": "How can Muslims pray in a plane? (seated, Qibla behind us, praying standing next to emergency exits)",
  "transcript": "farook from Qatar so my question is how should I pay on a flight with the airline asks for passengers to pay from their seats but on my particular flight the koibla is directly behind me when I see it on my seat also most of the flight attendants are non-muslims so they wouldn't give any importance to the Salah and they they would prohibit it they would like prohibit it they would prohibit me from standing and paying an empty corners of the plane as they are like emergency exits we've addressed this issue before Farooq but we will repeat it again standing up to offer your followed prayer is one of the pillars of Salat so if you're able and you sit down your prayer is invalid this is number one so if I'm unable to stand up simply because the flight attendants are not allowing to especially if you are in the economy class there is no room for you to stand most likely because of the time the the airplanes being tight and the ceiling is low in this case if there is no possibility for you to stand up then you may sit down facing the Qibla is one of the conditions of Salat and this condition is excused if you're unable as in the case while flying and the Qibla is to your back so I cannot face the Qibla I cannot stand let alone face the Qibla in this case this condition is compromised and Allah has given you the concession to pray elsewhere due to necessity now if you're in a business class or a first class there is enough room for you to pray where you are standing up and sometimes you can even prostrate in some uh Airlines but at least you can stand up and maybe you can face the Qibla so you have to do this bowing is normal prostrating is might not be possible you can sit down and bow or lean forward as if you're prostrating to the best of your ability and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
