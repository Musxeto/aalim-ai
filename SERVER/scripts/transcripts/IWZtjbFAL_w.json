  "transcript": "a lot of the sisters complain and say that we have so many days to make up of Ramadan and we have our own excuses in show 1 and we won't have enough time so the answer would be as jebin I think means said may Allah have mercy on his soul let us assume that a woman gave birth in the month of Ramadan or let us assume that she had 14 days of menses in Ramadan so she fasted 16 days sure while was over first day of read she started from the second day of sha1 and fasted making up the 14 days on the 15th of Shaban when she finished making up for Ramadan she got her menses again for 10 12 13 days and now after she's pure she has only two days to fast from sure while remaining we say fast these two days and in Valletta you can fast the other four days and this would make up for the six days of Showa because you had a legitimate reason and this is the photo of women as a mean and it's also the photo of share about man even Nasir a Sarah D because you had a legitimate reason those who are lazy and don't fast during the month of Ramadhan don't do not fast during the month of Shawwal and they're late and they want to make it up in the Creta without a legitimate reason there is not an excuse for them and this would not be legitimate"
