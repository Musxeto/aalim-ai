You said that you say about the dog licking the utensil but I asked about the dog nose touching it okay is the nose same as the licking yes or no no so the answer is clear the dog's nose has nothing to do with licking if the dog sniffs something then there's no problem the problem is then there's no problem the problem is in the saliva of the dog not in the wetness of the dog's nose I hope this answers your question"
