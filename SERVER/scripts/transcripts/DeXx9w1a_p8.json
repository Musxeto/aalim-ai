  "transcript": "s from Canada uh is it okay if I ask two questions nope one only okay um the if the closest mjid to me is around the 10-minute walk but it is Sufi or B and they do a lot of B is it permissible for me to go there and the rest of them as long as there isn't any other or a clean Masjid that has no innovation and this is the only Masjid you have if the IM is involved in shik or kufur you must not pray there but if it's only then this is the only alternative and choice you have so you go there and pray and leave immediately without participating in their BAS"
