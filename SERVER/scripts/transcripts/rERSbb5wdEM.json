  "title": "He got a gift from a NonMuslim to pay his overdue Zakat, what if this was in a riba based bank?",
  "transcript": "Khurram from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? I'm doing great. What can I do for you? Alhamdulillah. Sheikh my question, if a person takes either debt or money as help which doesn't have to be returned from either a non-Muslim or a Muslim who doesn't offer Salah and doesn't know whether it is kept in a Riba-based bank which most probably is and gives such money as Zakah on gold jewelry to compensate for past years, is such Zakah valid or does he have to investigate whether the money is kept in Riba-based banks or not and whether it is totally halal or not? JazakAllah Sheikh. The moment someone gives you money as a gift, it doesn't matter whether it was the result of an interest-based loan, a fixed deposit, it was a bribe given to this person, a haram money, he cheated others, as long as you are not certain that it was stolen. That's the only thing. But if it's haram money of Riba or selling intoxicants and it earns this haram money and he gives it to you as a gift, you can do with that money whatever you want, whether you pay off your Zakat for gold or for anything else, you pay off your debts, you buy food, you pay the rent, it's halal totally for you and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
