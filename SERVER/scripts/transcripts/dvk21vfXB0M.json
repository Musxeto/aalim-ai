  "title": "Hijab in front of See Through Curtains? They can see a blurred image of me.. assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salha says, In my home, most of our curtains are like see-through, but not white, usually like a blue or natural or neutral color. So if I stand in front of it, people could most likely see a blurred image of me. As a woman, should I wear a hijab in front of these windows when moving into its view? I was told that because they don't know it's me, it's fine. But I feel uncomfortable because it is not that blurred out. This is up to your preference, Saliha. If you think that you're not recognized, they cannot see your body figure, recognize your face, your hair, then there's no problem in that. When you wear your full hijab, people see you on the streets. And they see the same image those behind the curtains can see, a blurred image of a woman, not being able to recognize anything else. So I pray to Allah Azza Wa Jal that this is fine, Inshallah. For more information visit www.fema.org"
