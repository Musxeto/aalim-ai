  "transcript": "Muhammad from China Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi How are you doing Sheikh? Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Alameen How can I help you Muhammad? I would like to confirm a story that there was a time where Hazrat Bilal had some pronunciation problems and some of the Sahaba told him that someone else should call the Fajr Adhan and then at that day the sun has not risen and it remained dark and the Prophet peace be upon him replied that Allah has held back the sun as Bilal did not give the Fajr Adhan Is this authentic? No of course not, this is not authentic at all and it's not befitting of the Sunnah and of the Seerah and of Bilal May Allah be pleased with him to be involved in such Bollywood type stories No, this is totally unreal and not true and Allah knows best"
