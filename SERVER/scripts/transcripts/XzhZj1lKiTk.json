  "transcript": "Safiyyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, for first prayer, the Sunnah, you have to read Surah Al-Kafirun and Surah Al-Ikhlas. Is my prayer still invalid if I forget to read those Surahs? JazakAllah Khair First of all Safiyyah, you said in Fajr Sunnah, we have to. The correction is, this is not correct. You do not have to. Because when you use the word have to, it gives a form of obligation. And it's not mandatory nor obligatory to read Al-Kafirun and Al-Ikhlas in Al-Fajr or in Al-Maghreb Sunnah. Rather it is highly recommended. So if someone deliberately prays the Sunnah of Fajr and reads only the Fatiha, nothing else, his prayer is valid. If he prays Al-Fatiha and any other ayah or Surah other than Al-Ikhlas and Al-Kafirun, the prayer is valid. But he would have lost some reward for not following the Sunnah. And I hope this answers your question. Al-Fatiha."
