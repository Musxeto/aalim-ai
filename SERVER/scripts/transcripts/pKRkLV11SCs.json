  "transcript": "our says what's the sooner way of praying there 8 prayer and how to pray while one is traveling first of all read prayer is prayed twice a year in the e de Ville footer which comes at the end of the month of Ramadan and in a they'll hatch which is on the 10th of the 12th month of the lunar year the month of dhul Hijjah and the format of this prayer is the same is it mandatory is it a communal obligation it is is it a highly recommended Sunnah it's an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that it is mandatory upon men and it is highly recommended for women the format is that the Muslims go to an open ground known as al masala it's an open plaza open piece of land usually it's outs out side the skirts of the city or the town and this is what the Prophet used to do at a salat wa sallam therefore praying it in messages is not the right thing to do so many Muslims all over the world pray it inside the Masjid but this is not the Sunnah of the Prophet Arizona we know that praying in the message of Medina is equivalent to a thousand prayers yet the Prophet erase awesome did never pray there aid in his Masjid he used to take the congregation to Al masala and they would pray in the open area under the open sky and the way to do this is to offer two Rakas like normal records but the only difference is that in the first raka he offers seven takbirs and in the second raka he offers five takbirs and the difference of opinion whether the seven takbirs are include with takbir at aloha or excluded I'm inclined to follow the opinion that says it's seven and you add these seven to takbir rattle Alam and this is done like so you say Allahu Akbar you read derisive tire which is Sena as they call it in order and then you make seven tech beers allahu akbar allahu akbar and the most authentic opinion that you raise your hands with every takbir and after you finish the seventh one you say audhu billah min al rajim bismillah remember him and you read the fatiha and surat al al s abysmal pickle Allah afterwards this is one of the sewers prescribed and then you make your rock or your to sujood and you stand up saying Allahu Akbar and then you recite five takbirs after that you say Allahu Akbar raising your hands and then you recite Fatiha surah and you continue your prayer as usual after the mmm finishes the prayer he goes and delivers one speech and this is an issue of dispute scholars differed some of them said he offers two speeches and he sits between them as in the case with a Friday sermon but this is not authentic because all those who reported it stated that the Prophet gave one speech alehissalaam and beside when he gave the hotbar the sermon the scholars or the companions did not take his pulpit with him they did not take a chair for him to sit down so claiming that he sat down between the two sermons would require some place to sit and it's an open area where would he sit so this again shows that it was only one sermon and after that at the end of it he would add the women and encourage them to give charity either by going there physically or nowadays because we have the loudspeakers one can do that in the same sermon and allah azzawajal knows best as for praying it while traveling it is recommended for a travel to pray it but it is not mandatory as congregation prayer for him is not mandatory as well"
