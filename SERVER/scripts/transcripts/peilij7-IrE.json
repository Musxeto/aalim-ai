  "title": "Can I cut or trim Sideburns ABOVE Earlobes or is it part of the Beard? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So my question is for about two years now, I've had like sideburns that don't go below my ear. And every time I go to the barber, they usually cut it. Am I sinful for cutting my beard or since he hasn't even gone below my ear, is that even considered a beard? Well, it seems that the definition of beard is the hair that grows on your lower jaw and your cheeks. So the lower jaw actually starts from just near the level of your ear. So if let's say half of your ear maybe is not considered part of your beard. So these sideburns can be cut off. This is what happens when we go to Umrah and the barber shaves our head. He goes to the half, almost half of the beard, the ear that is, and he cuts whatever is on top of it, not below of it. So this is permissible and Allah knows best. Al-Fatiha."
