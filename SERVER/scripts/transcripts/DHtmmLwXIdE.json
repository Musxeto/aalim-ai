  "transcript": "sonia says what's the ruling on exchanging old gold for new gold the prophet alaihi salatwa told us that it is a form of riba to exchange gold with gold unless they are identical in weight and in quality and this is done simultaneously give and take at the same time at the same incident but who would do this if i've uh have 10 grams of 24 karat gold and you have 10 grams of 24 carrot gold it's identical why would i give you mine and take yours it's the same gold doesn't make any sense it shows you that riba is a very technical concept so if i have bangles or a bracelet made of gold and i'd like to go to the goldsmith or to the jewelry shop and exchange it for something new a newer model a newer gold a different design this is totally prohibited in islam what the people do is excuse me how much is this bracelet cost he says 500 and how much will you charge me for that bracelet he weighs it and says 700. so i said okay take mine for 500. here's an additional 200 and give me that new one this is riba totally prohibited what to do then sheikh you have to first sell the bracelet at hand so 500 give me 500 in cash so he gives you 500 in cash the transaction is over if you wish you can leave you've got the money he's got the bracelet ended the deal mission accomplished now if you want to buy that new one say to him get me this new one how much is it he's at 700. he said okay make it far 695 you may bargain it's up to you you may change your mind and go somewhere else but either way now you want to buy it you give him 700 in cash and take the new bracelet and these are two separate unrelated transactions and this is the way of doing gold exchange in a halal way you"
