  "transcript": "our third question for tonight is from Zara and Zeller says should we maintain for Raqqa off sooner before answer on daily basis we know that there are emphatic Sunnis during the day and night and those are 12 raucous if you maintain if you observe them then allah azza wajal would build you a house in Jena two before fetcher for two by two before the - after the - after Maghrib and after Asia these are 12 but there are Sunnis that are not emphatic not as highly recommended which scholars say that the prophetess and did not highly recommend yet he recommended but he did not observe them and he did not do them regularly such as - extra after the  so instead of only two no he used to pray for after the whole and also for rokkes before awesome and the hadith in it whether it's authentic or hasan that the Prophet assalam said may Allah have mercy on a man who prays for records before awesome so this caused some dispute among scholars one group of scholars said that you should not pray these four Rockets before other everyday why they said because the Prophet did not do it and it is best for you not to do it so Subhan Allah the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam recommended it and he said may allah have mercy upon a person who prays for before other and you come and tell me not to pray it every day yes not only that even the Torah cos of ha you should not pray that every day so that people would not think that this is an emphatic Sunnah okay what are you bringing this from so this group of scholars thought that the Prophet not doing it on regular basis means that it is best for us not to do it on regular basis but this is not true due to the fact that the Prophet had recommended it alayhi salaatu said it becomes recommended so if the Prophet has some only performed Hajj once in his lifetime you do not prohibit me from doing that if the Prophet only performed two ombres in his life you do not say do not do three or four or ten or twenty because he recommended it and by recommending and encouraging his Ummah to do it that is sufficient I don't need any more evidence to do it so the other group that says that do it every single day are correct and this is the most authentic opinion"
