  "transcript": "Maham from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So I read that it is not permissible for a woman to reveal her face for a passport unless like traveling is necessary and like it was the fatwa of Sheikh Ibn Baz and I followed that opinion but I have to reveal my passport and my parents are going to get like angry if I don't and they're already calling me an extremist so what should I do in that case I don't understand your question do you have a passport yes or no it's going to get expired so I have to renew it okay okay are you going to travel um I'm not sure like probably if you're not going to travel don't renew it it's very simple and if you're going to travel once you want to travel renew it and this is a necessity without any problem"
