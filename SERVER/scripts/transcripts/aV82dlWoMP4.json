  "transcript": "You will win if you are patient. And finally, to those who say, why do I ask and make dua and Allah does not answer? This is not true. Allah answers every single dua you make. Sheikh, I beg to differ. I have been calling Allah Azza Wa Jal for so many years and He did not answer. Could this be? Yes or no? Those who say yes, raise your hand. Could this be that you're calling Allah for so many years and He doesn't answer? Raise your hand. Yes. One, two. Okay, let's see the opposite. No. Oh, okay, that's good. MashaAllah. Everybody says no. This is impossible. When you make dua, Allah answers. Ya Allah, grant me a million dollars. I know it's going to happen. The problem is the Prophet told us how it's going to happen. Number one, oh Allah, grant me a million dollars. Boom. My uncle in Brazil dies. He happens to be a multi-millionaire. I'm the only heir. So I inherit a million dollars. MashaAllah. Gift from Allah. Alhamdulillah. Allah answered my prayer. Number two, this is the Prophet saying, the ways of Allah's answering. Oh Allah, grant me a million dollars. Something happens. The Prophet says, Allah deflects harm that was predestined to happen to you, equivalent to this. So my business was supposed to receive a shock that makes me lose a million dollars. One way or the other, Allah makes it happen and Allah is the best of planners. And Alhamdulillah, I avoid this loss. But I don't see it. Like, yeah Allah give me a thousand dollars. And it doesn't come. And while I'm driving, all of a sudden a car jumps in front of me. I managed to, the last second, avoid it. Otherwise I could have crashed into it. It would have costed me a thousand dollars. But Allah saved me. What do I do? Yeah, I'm a good driver. Michael Schumacher. Formula One. This is what we do. We see calamities that we have escaped to be our own strength and power and never attributed to Allah Azza wa Jalla by saying Alhamdulillah, Allah saved me. Number three, yeah Allah grant me one million dollars. He doesn't give it to me here. He does not deflect harm that was coming to me equivalent to a million dollars, but he saves it to me on the Day of Judgment. I come on the Day of Judgment and I see mountains and mountains of good deeds. I didn't do this. Angels say this is your dua. So never despair. Never doubt Allah. Make as many dua as you want and Allah will give you. Omar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, Oh Prophet of Allah, then we make a lot of dua. If this is the case, I will make six hours of dua. I'm a winner both ways. The Prophet said, Allah is more. You make dua, Allah will give you."
