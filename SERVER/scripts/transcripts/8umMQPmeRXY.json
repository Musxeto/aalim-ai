  "transcript": "smelly Habana raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen well a shadow and la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh sallallahu alayhe wa aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in mi do dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamo alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this new episode of women around the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam among our mothers among the wives of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam whom we all acknowledge are the best of women there was a wife and her name was Xena Ben - who's Emma and her father's name was Jose Mahan in hadith her mother was a famous woman by the name of hint bent have been Zuhair hand had many daughters and she got her daughters married to some of the dignitaries of Quraysh so just to be married to one of her daughters meant that you will be connected to so many in-laws and people who are related to you through her so she was the mother of zaynab bint Hazama may allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers and she also was the mother of my Munna Bentall hadith who later on became the wife of the Prophet SAS awesome also she was the mother of omal father the wife of Abbas the uncle of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and she was also the mother of selma bent the wife of the uncle of the Prophet Isis erm Hamza even Abdul Muttalib she's also the mother of asthma been to Rome ace who was married to Jeff Arab Natalie the cousin of the Prophet as Sarah when he was martyred she married abu bakr as-siddiq the first caliph and when he died she married a demon Abu Talib the brother of her first husband and the cousin of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so her in-laws her family those whom were connected to her and to her siblings were honorable people and no wonder because someone that the dignitaries of Quraysh seek after getting marriage from their daughters must be of a certain caliber they had been Hosea was known before Islam to be caring loving and merciful to the poor and to the needy and that is why she was known as the mother of the needy oman Masaki when she died she was only thirty years of age and before the prophet alayhi salatu salam married her she was married to obey the abdel hadith even al-muttalib and her beta is one of the first to accept islam and he was among the three heroes of islam who came to a duel in the beginning of the Battle of butter the first major battle between truth and falsehood between Islam and disbelief Plus men only going out to attack a convoy coming from Syria to Mecca looking for the money for the wealth in compensation for what was taken from them only to find that they've missed that Caravan and instead an army of a thousand men or more with Knights camels with full al Tillery and weapons fully armed is there to fight them they only took something that was to be used with a caravan unarmed so they didn't have any heavy weaponry so in the beginning the disbelievers the idol worshipers utbah and sheba the sons of Rabia and they're worried about ba came out asking for a jewel so three from the people of Medina from the answer came out and identified themselves but the idol worshiper said you are honorable people but we want our next of kin we want our own people the Mujahideen the migrants to fight them so the Prophet Hadees or some ordered obey definite hadith Hamza Nabil metallic and not even ABI talib all from his closest kin and they fought and they managed to win hamza killed the one he was fighting Ali killed the one who was fighting obey the evening hadith and if I'm not mistaking it was rudaba who was fighting him they extend exchange blows and they were injured so then they finished him off Oh Bader was injured in this battle and soon afterwards he died now being the cousin of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and his wife being alone in medina the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam proposed to her and after marrying hafsa the prophet proposed to zaynab bint Hussein in the third year of hijra and the prophet alayhi salatu salam married her only to live with her for only three months in some narrations say eight months she soon afterwards passed away and died so she was the second wife of the Prophet a little ofsome to die in his lifetime there were only two who died in his lifetime Khadijah the mother of the believers may Allah be pleased with her and zeinab bent Hosea may Allah be pleased with her but in this three months she gained the honour of this life and in the Hereafter for being our prophets wife in Paradise sallallahu alayhi wa are you Selim the second wife we are to talk about today insha'Allah is a well-known name so whenever you hear her name you don't have to look for the daughter of so and so and so so whenever you hear the name of Khadijah this is an icon you know it when you hear the name Masha this is an icon by itself you know it when you hear the name mo Salama this is an icon of it's owned her real name is hint been to a be Omega have nil Mahela and he was among the generous men of price and this is an attribute to be praised when you known to be generous and to give this is something to be proud of in Arabia her mother was erotic have been timer ignore a BIA and she was Nick named by Salama because she married her cousin Abu Salim and I was salimah may Allah be pleased with him is the cousin of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam his mother is bara bin Abdul Muttalib so he was one of the prophets cousins adding his salat WA Salam and his name was Abdullah having a big asset he was among the first to accept Islam alongside with umm Salama and they suffered greatly in the beginning of the introduction of Islam to crush so they had to migrate to Abyssinia then they traveled back to Mecca and then Abu Salama traveled and migrated to Medina he had seen so many things in his life when he wanted to migrate and he was among the first and some say he was the first to migrated to Medina his in-laws came to the outskirts of Mecca and they said to him if you want to go this is your problem and if you want to take your wife with you then this is your problem so when she was prevented from going and accompanying her husband her in-laws the family of apostle Emma took her son from her hands and said we will not leave our son with her if you are migrating to Medina and she stayed for a whole year weeping and crying unable to go and catch up with her husband and unable to leave her son behind who was sort of abducted by his kin until they felt sorry for her and returned her son to her so now they have been reunited but the problem is that there's no one to take her to Medina and to travel there it may take like three to five good days on camel's back so she went to the outskirts of Mecca every single day trying to go and to leave until she decided to leave on her own which was totally unheard of extremely dangerous for a woman to travel in the wilderness without any man protecting her and Allah Azza WA JAL sent to her earth not even a thought having a VTOL ha who saw her identified her and asked her what about is she going and when she told him he felt obligated to accompany her and to protect her so he accompanied her to Medina and she praised his moral ethics and conduct that he had never looked at her and whenever she dismounted from her camel he would move few steps and give his back so that he would not see anything that was inappropriate he never spoke to her until he got her to Medina and left her and went back to Mecca this was the chivalry of the Arabs long back even those who were not Muslims this was instilled in them being mad the feelings of of being a man and being generous being courageous being courteous and respecting others when Abu Salama was with the Prophet Elias a lot of Sam he was a very close companion to him he is his cousin not only that he is his brother through suckling because we know that the Prophet is awesome when he was born he was given to the way beer which was the slave concubine of his uncle Abu Lahab so she suckled him and she is suckled Abu Salama and she also suckled Hamza Ben Abdul Muttalib so all three are siblings through suckling so I was almost close to the Prophet Isis Salam and he fought better with him and he also fought alongside the Prophet a son in the Battle of odd which was on the third year of hijra only to be wounded and this wound did not recover completely and few months later on it erupted again and caused him to die now there are milestones in people's lives and if we were to ask mother oom Salama what is your milestone she would definitely without any doubt say that it was that incident which accompanied the death of her husband abu Salama she tells us that Abu said i'ma once came and he told her that I heard the prophet alayhi salat wa salam say and by the way this was the habit of the Muslims of the Companions whenever they hear a piece of information that is beneficial for the Muslim they would convey it to them and the first that they would convey to is their family their wives the children so he came in immediately started preaching i heard the prophet alayhi salatu salams say whoever is afflicted by a calamity and recites in allahu ala Hajin we are taught to Allah we are we belong to Allah and we shall return to him and then supplicate by saying along Jordan if emissivity Oh Allah reward me in my calamity well of Nehalem in ha and substitute me with something better than that so I memorized this hadith till the date that I was selling my my husband passed away so when he died I immediately said this to her but then I contemplated afterwards who can be better than Abu Salama substitute me with something better than it who can't be better than Abu Saleh and after my head was over and we know that the idea of a widow is 4 months and 10 days i heard the prophet alayhi salatu salam seek permission to meet me and he came in so he asked me and asked for my hand in marriage so I explained to him o prophet of Allah no one can reject you no one can turn you down you are the dream of every woman on earth but the problem is I am a jealous woman and I am an old woman compared to your wives and I have children so I may be considered to some as axis luggage so the prophet alayhi salat wa salam acknowledging that she was alone and that her husband was a close companion of his his cousin and his brother said to her as for your age I'm older than you so this is not a legitimate reason as for your jealousy I will ask allah azzawajal to take care of it and as for your children i will provide for them and they are under my sponsorship so she agreed and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam married her and only then she thought to herself now I know what can be better than Abu Salam o the wisdom of the Prophet iris I'm marrying someone with four children or three with someone who's not that young with someone who's alone and her tribe are not is not with her is that to show the community that Allah Azza WA JAL does not leave people stranded and in need without any help so many times we have calamities Kitaj catastrophes crises surrounding us and overwhelming us and we think that this is the end not believing in Allah not trusting Allah not fully relying upon him we soon would find the way out these are frequent lessons from Allah to us if we were to only comprehend and understand the prophet alayhi salat wa salam proposed to Salama her guardian was her son and few of the companions were there alongside to witness such a marriage contract now she lived with the Prophet Isis I am unlike other wives because she did not feel jealous so she did not cause any problems to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the Prophet had a habit of visiting all of his nine wives when it was her time or the likes so he would start with umm Salama because she was the oldest of his wives and then end up with aisha being the youngest and he would sit for maybe 10-15 minutes chit chatting checking on them and he would you do this every single day sallallahu alayhe wa aalihi wasallam umm Salama was a chaste woman a kind woman and the Prophet appreciated her Alyce awesome he appreciated her wisdom and kindness he trusted her and he took in her children as his own living in his house and Allah Azza WA JAL would put in the prophet's heart some la la assalam caring for her so he would probably give her gifts to indicate to her that she has a special place in his heart one of the situations that she's well known of was that in the treaty of hudaibiya when the prophet elisha salam went to mecca to perform Umrah on the fifth of the sixth year of hijra and he was blocked by the idol worshipers so they wrote a treaty stating that this year he cannot come in he has to go out but they're wearing a humph so the Prophet went and addressed the people who are wearing a harem waiting eagerly to go and perform the Umrah he said to them we sign the treaty we have to go back to Medina and hence whoever is blocked from completing his ritual you know the ruling which is that you have to slaughter your Heidi your sacrifice and shave your heads so shave your heads and sacrifice your this was a directive from the prophet alayhi salatu salam to his astonishment no-one complied so he went into his tent being angry and mentioned to umm Salama what had happened from his people they're not obeying me so I'm selling money Allah be pleased with her said to him o prophet of Allah would you like them to obey you go out do not speak to a soul until you slaughter your own sacrifice and call the barber to shave off your head so the Prophet dies of salaam went out of his tent did not speak to anyone slaughtered his own sacrifice and asked the barber to shave his head the moment he did this all the Companions came back to the senses and they hastened to slaughter their sacrifice and to shave their own heads as if they were about to kill one another because of wanting to do it in a so quick fashion and manner this is why the profit I son loved umm Salama for being wise for being intellectual due to her age and due to her upbringing as well being with the prophet alayhi salat wa salam she narrated as the the happy remember the heavy says in his most in her most net 380 hadith and we know that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam had many things with his wives that the companions did not know so she told us that the prophet used to kiss her and go to pray without performing woudl and the same hadith was narrated by Aisha may Allah be pleased with her and also that she used to perform Russell with the Prophet as I am taking from the same bucket and so many other hadith about nocturnal emission for women when she was there about menses about so many topics that were among the things that she had witnessed herself and she kept on after the death of the prophet alayhi salatu salam teaching and sharing this knowledge that she gained in the house of the Prophet Allah so some with the Muslims when she died some say she died at the age of 84 and some say that she died at the age of 90 and she died as the mother of the believers and one of the wives of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam nada Allahu Alem when especially Elmi alayhi assalam wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he Rosalina be anymore well either early he was happy he edged mine"
