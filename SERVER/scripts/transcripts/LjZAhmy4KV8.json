  "transcript": "Humans, they tend to forget. It was reported in the authentic hadith that when Allah Azza Wa Jal created Adam and wiped over his back, there fell from his back every single soul that Allah would create until the Day of Judgment. And they were displayed to Adam and Adam saw them and said, what is this? So Allah told him, these are your offspring. And he saw a man with sparkling eyes and he liked how he looked and he said, oh Allah, who is this? So Allah said, this is one of your sons, Dawud, peace be upon him, the Prophet of Allah. And he will come at the end of time, at the last of the nations. So Adam said, and how is he to live? How long is he to live? And Allah Azza Wa Jal said, 60 years. And in another narration Adam asked, and how long will I live? And Allah said, a thousand years. So he said, give him some years of my age. Narration said 20, narration says 40. And when Adam's time was up and the angel of death came to claim his soul, he said to him, don't I have like 40 years left in my lifespan? And the angel of death said, didn't you give it to your son?"
