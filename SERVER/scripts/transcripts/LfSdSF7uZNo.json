  "transcript": "Aisha from India uh I don't want to Gove to my hometown where I have to get stuck inside four walls for days I'm getting frustrated it is a Muslim Village in India where people are not much educated especially women don't go out they just attend marriages don't even go out for eers uh I feel uh I'm closer to a la in host in a medical college and and I think my Dad gives me lectures more kind of uh to work and earn but I feel I want to get closer to the Islamic practices I just want a home with more practicing educated people around and discuss such things but I feel my home is not such a place what would you advise me from such a village I don't understand your question are you asking me about the permissibility of relocating and leaving your parents' house to live alone no shik uh I have avoided to talk to my dad's lectures you you what he his lectures about working and earning in the next part of life after studies okay so you don't want to work and and and earn of course I want to do but I want to become more Islamic I'm afraid that this would lead me somewhere no you have to strike the balance of course our focus and priority would would be to learn our religion and to practice it as Allah wants us to do so but this does not mean that we isolate ourselves in a shell and leave worldly sciences and leave means of earning Halal uh income if we are capable of doing this through the proper channels by abiding the hijab by avoiding freem mixing doesn't mean that yes for a woman her place is in her home with her husband and children this is her her pror priority but unfortunately some women don't get the chance to get married and some women become the bread winner due to the age and the financial status of their parents so if this is the case you have to strike the right balance between working studying and avoiding Haram and learning your religion the Quran Arabic and becoming a better Muslim and Allah Knows Best"
