  "transcript": "then what is tadabur what is to reflect upon the quran some people think that this is related to tafsir and this is not true tafsir is very important and it's the first level of tadabur you cannot reach the dabur without tafsir which leads us to something that a lot of the muslims fall into as a big mistake and that is to think that they can reach the level of tidabur on their own so you get someone who doesn't know arabic who had never gone through a book of tafsir and he sits on his couch and he says i was pondering upon this verse and i came up with this idea imagine that allah means so and so and so by this verse did you get this from said i contemplated upon it alhamdulillah allah guided me to find this meaning this is inapplicable this is not permissible because you're not qualified my friend to do this to give tafsir on your own like this this is a great mistake that you are committing so we have to understand that pondering as the way the word means or the word is stemmed from it's stemmed from the word and means the end of things so essentially means what the ayah would eventually lead to so i understand the meaning of the word i understand the meaning of the verse but what is meant by it and what it should lead us to that is to implement it to understand what it entails is what is included in tadabur and this is a very high level of understanding the quran because quran is a book that creates souls that it creates nations it builds civilizations this is the ability of the quran this is the capacity of the quran unfortunately if you lit a torch and then you don't see the light there's nothing wrong with the torch if your eyes are closed it's your vision that is impaired the torch is fine the light is shining but it is your vision that is impaired we have the book we have the torch there is nothing more worthy of being pondered upon than the quran there is nothing to reflect upon that is better than the quran where you should focus to understand you"
