  "transcript": "muhammad from nigeria a man was given money from his office he didn't know what the money was for then his boss called and said that one of our clients gave us this money and i thought of distributing it to the employees and giving you a little bit extra because you usually do hard work if the boss is the owner of the company he's the owner of everything the job and and and everything in this is permissible because this money given to the owner is a gift it's not a bribe because he's the owner he cannot be bright but if he is a manager or a director who does not own you cannot take that money because this was given by a client and this is a clear bribe"
