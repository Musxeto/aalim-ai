  "transcript": "Sajida says is it against the Sunnah to drink water in the midst of having a meal do I have to wait till I finish my meal before drinking water even if I'm thirsty the answer is there is no sooner in forcing you to drink or forcing you not to drink this is up to your own preference so it has nothing to do with halal Haram recommended or not recommended it depends on whether you like it or not it depends on the culture some cultures do not recommend drinking water while eating I personally do not like to drink anything while eating a meal because this expands your stomach makes you eat more while having your meal unlike when you drink water a glass or two before a meal this is good because it makes your stomach half full and then you would not eat as much analyzed Oh JAL knows best"
