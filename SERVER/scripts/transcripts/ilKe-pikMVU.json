  "transcript": "Rajab from Russia Assalamu Alaikum Well, I don't know if it's a belief in bad omens or a belief in superstition or what it is. For example, if I watch a video with music, I know that I'm sinful for it, but if there is something bad in the video, for example, someone If it's what? If it's what? And so I turn off the video so as not to get into an accident as a punishment. Yeah, this has nothing to do with superstition. This has to do with fearing Allah's punishment. Now, Allah's punishment may not necessarily be similar to what you had seen in the video, which is an accident. It may be even worse and it may not materialize in this life. Allah may store it for you in your grave or may store it for you on the day of judgment and you'll be admitted to hell for that. So this fear in you of being punished, which makes you refrain from continuing to do this sin, is a fear of Allah and that's positive."
