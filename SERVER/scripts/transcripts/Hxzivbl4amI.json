  "transcript": "Sister Eve from the UK. Sheikh I've got two questions if that's alright. Yep, go ahead. I'm trying to commit to the Sunnah fast and right now the three wide days is going to be on Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So if I do Thursday, which is also the Sunnah fast. So it's going to be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. And the days are very long right now in the UK. Is it mandatory to fast on 13th, 14th, 15th? Maybe I can do 14th, 15th, 16th and combine it with Monday, but it would be a bit shorter. Is that okay? Okay, second question. First of all, is it mandatory to fast these voluntary days? If they're voluntary, how can they be mandatory? So if the wide days coincide with Friday, Saturday and Sunday, but you're used to fasting Mondays and Thursdays every week, which one would I prefer? I'd prefer that you skip the wide days, observe the Mondays and Thursdays, because at the end of the month, you would have fasted eight days, rather than fasting the wide days, which is only three days per month. If you can combine both, that's a win-win. So combining Thursday with the following three days, the wide days, and a Monday, that's pretty fine. But if it is difficult for you, you can choose whatever you want. However, choosing to do the 14th and the 15th, because it's a Saturday and a Sunday, and combining Monday with it, would not give you the virtue of fasting the three days that are the wide days. It's a package deal. Either you fast 13th, 14th and the 15th together, or no need to fast any of them, and just randomly fast any three days of the month. So I hope this answers your first question. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
