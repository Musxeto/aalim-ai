  "transcript": "Yasser from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh I know a brother who initially applied to a job by lying about his experience but later on in the hiring process he said or he clarified he doesn't have that experience and the company they still hired him because he has like a relevant knowledge of that protocol and as they require certification not to mention they said they will offer him training is his income halal Sheikh? As long as they've acknowledged he lied and he is fulfilling the job requirement and they're offering him training he's doing his work he has to repent from lying but the income is halal inshallah if the job is halal you"
