  "transcript": "uh adil from india can we use water which has been mixed with uh chlorine or other chemicals for udon gosul if not can we do thai moon or do we must use drinking water yes repeat your question and speak a little bit slower please can we use water which has been mixed with chlorine or other chemicals for ozone gosul if not can we do thiam this water added is used in swimming pools for example in taps okay tab water is usually mixed with a little amount of chlorine so that it would kill germs in it now if i have a mug of tap water and i smell it and i can smell some chlorine in it would i identify it as water or a different liquid the answer would be water therefore as long as it carries the label water i can perform muscle with it i can perform wudo with it and in some cases if it's medically safe i can even drink it there's no problem in that the problem is when the liquid changes its label and name and nature so this mug if i bring a tea bag and i soak it in it and i throw it away what is this liquid is it water the answer is no this is t this i cannot use it for russell or for performing wudu so the end product is what counts if i have this mug with some flour in it because they used to use it with dough and and the likes and there is some flour so it's murky with some flour in it but the end result it's water with some mud with some flour with some rust in it but it's water you can use that for drink for um wudu and russell and i hope this answers your question you"
