  "transcript": "father says that she vowed to fast if her relative recovers from her illness so she vowed to fast ten days and her relative hamdullah recovered first of all making a vow is not recommended the Prophet said Ali salatu salam that making a vow is one of the means that allah extract from a miser from a stingy person money how is that I would not have paid a penny in charity nor slaughtered a sheep for the sake of Allah to feed the poor but when my son is sick I said o Allah if you cure my son I'm gonna slaughter a sheep for the poor so Allah Azza WA JAL makes this vow something he extracts from this misery or from the stingy person and this is why it's not recommended I'm putting something an obligation upon myself that Allah did not mandate upon me why would I make life difficult and burden myself Allah does not love this but if a person enters into such a vow in this case he must fulfill it as long as it's in a form of worship or it's something that is rewarded such as fasting now she made that a vow of fasting ten days and she fasted one of them on a Saturday but some people said that this is not permissible those who told you it's not permissible they are partially correct because there is a prohibition to isolate Friday or Saturday in fasting without a legitimate reason so someone is off on a Friday said okay I'm gonna fast why because it's Shaban I left a fast job and we said no this is not permissible you have to either fast the Plus Friday or Friday plus Saturday the same goes for Saturday you either fast the day before or a day after but do not isolate it unless there's a legitimate reason and your reason is legitimate because vows are mandatory to fulfill and to fast therefore isolating a Friday or a Saturday there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah and Allah knows best"
