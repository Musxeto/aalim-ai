  "transcript": "Ajas from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I am suffering from IBS. For some prayers I can't pray without passing gas. But for some prayers I can pray. I can pray. I can't pray. Akhi, I don't understand your question. If you're suffering from gas coming all the time, if this is coming all the time and it doesn't stop at all, and there is no period of time that you know it will stop, that will allow you to pray without passing gas, in this case you're excused. You're ma'zur. So the moment the adhan is given, you go and perform wudu. While performing wudu, even if you break your wudu with gas, there's no problem. Even if you walk to the masjid or you pray and you pass wind, there's no problem because it's continuous. But if there is half an hour or an hour that you know between dhuhr and asr, you will have this time free from passing gas, then you have to wait and pray there with a normal wudu. And Allah azza wa jal knows best."
