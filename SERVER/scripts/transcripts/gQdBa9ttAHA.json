  "title": "Can we brush teeth & use soap DURING Wudu? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] says can we apply soap \nbrush the teeth during ablution   we know that ablution has 6 pillars what are these \npillars number 1 washing the face which includes   turning the water in your mouth and sniffing \nthe water up your nostrils and blowing it out   number 2 washing your arms from the beginning \nof your fingertips till your elbows including   your elbows number 3 wiping over your head \nwhich includes also wiping your ears number 4   washing your feet including \nthe ankles to the ankles   number 5 the sequence the order so face \narms head feet number 6 to be simultaneous   meaning that you don't leave a gap and \nthe issue of not leaving a gap is relative   so usually brushing the teeth or using the \nmiswak is negligible its a minute amount   of time like 30 secs or so or maybe a minute \nbut opening the door or answering a phone call   or checking if the food is cooked or \nneeds to be turned over or not this breaks   the simultaneousness of your wudu and hence you \nneed to repeat it from scratch likewise if you   for example while washing your arms found at that \nthere's a barrier so you're engaged in scrubbing   it and washing it with soap that may take sometime \nbut its for the purpose of wudu not for something   external so this amount is also exempted without \nany problem and Allah azzawajal knows best"
