  "title": "Does Boasting about Music & Movies make you a Kafir exposing sin",
  "transcript": "my question is what's ruling on those people who discuss about movies and songs because i read that posting about seniors is it true that they are out of islam okay i will answer inshallah from pakistan those who boast about music and movies and that they've seen these movies and boast about songs etc are they disbelievers no they're sinful this there's a big problem here with the muslims and i get a lot of counseling sessions a lot of phone calls a lot of questions on the website asking me is this kufur is this shirk and they are not aware that the meaning of kufur is not what they have in their minds this is how shaytan play with them as children play with football so he confuses them oh if i write with my left hand is this kufur okay if i say that marrying an arab is not a good thing is that kufur because the prophet was an arab so did i go and took they don't even know what kufur means so i advise people who have such thoughts to go to youtube in my youtube channel there's a playlist called the islamic faith and it talks about akida episode eight nine ten and eleven four episodes i speak specifically about the types of kuffer and some of these ocds that people are suffering from you"
