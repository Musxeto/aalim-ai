  "transcript": "We have Roko from U.S. Is he different than Roko from Canada? No, Sheikh. So how come? You're at the borders or what? Excuse me? You just asked a question, correct? No. Okay. I'm different. I am. Okay. What can I do for you? Assalamu Alaikum, Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. I have a question. Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. I recently have reached the age where I have more open opportunities to get jobs and there's one that I really want to work at since it's really close to my school and I can walk to. It is Christian owned and I wonder if there's any restrictions to working there. There's no problem in working for a Christian or a Jew or an atheist or whatever denomination providing that the job description is halal and what you're doing and the earning is halal. So Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, worked for some time under the supervision and the ownership of a Jew to earn. Salman Al-Farisi did this. Some of the companions also did this and there's no problem providing that the work itself is halal and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah. Bi-idhnillah azza wa jal."
