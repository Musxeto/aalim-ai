  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam. Sheikh, there are people around us, maybe our close relatives, friends or colleagues, who have the bad habit of not paying the debt, but when they need to borrow money, they always promise that they will return it on time, even though we know the chances are pretty low. Since we are not permitted to lie, like by saying sorry I don't have money, and sometimes it's also not possible to directly refuse them because they are our close ones. So still, how can we indirectly refuse them? JazakAllah. Well, the best way of replying to such people who are blatant liars and deceivers is to use what is known as Al-Ma'arid, to camouflage and disguise your answer so it wouldn't be a blatant lie. So for example, if I have two bank accounts, one of them has fifty dollars and the other one has all my wealth. So when someone comes and asks money from me, I say Wallahi I don't have except fifty dollars in my bank account. And I'm not lying. Or I say Wallahi I don't have any money, and I mean on me at this moment. I have only five or ten dollars on me. But the rest of the money is in my safe or in my bank account. This is not lying. And by doing so, you judge, you dodge lying. You do not lie, and you dodge it by giving them an ambiguous answer. Allah knows best."
