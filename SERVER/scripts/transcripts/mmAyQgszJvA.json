  "transcript": "Al-Aqra’ bin Habis Al-Tamimi was sitting\nwith the prophet ﷺ and he saw the prophet kissing one of his grandchildren. Al-Aqra’ said: you do this? I have ten children, and I have never kissed\nany of them. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings\nbe upon him, looked at him and then said:\" He who is not merciful will not be shown mercy\"\nand in another narration: \"what can I do if Allah has removed mercy from your heart\" this\nissue of kissing is evidence of a problem if it doesn't exist in a household, because\nthe household that doesn't have affection between the father or the mother, a lot of\nthe times children complain that there is no hugs(حضن) you hear this in informal\nlanguage(العامية) what is this no hugs? when meeting or parting with the parents,\nfathers are too rigid and some of them are too emotional so balance is necessary because\nwhen children are raised with love, mercy and affection this no doubt affects his personalty. the prophet ﷺ (in a matter concerning justice)\nwhen one of the companions were with him and the companions young son came to him he kissed\nhim smelled him and sat him on his thigh then his daughter came and she was the same age\nas the son or close to him and he sat her in front of him no kissing and no hugging\nthe prophet ﷺ said:\"you have not done justice between them\" and in another narration: \"would\nyou treat them equally\" this a problem why would someone treat the males better than\nthe females this is the doing of the ignorant times\n(Jahilyah) when they congratulate him with a girl his face blackens but when they tell\nhim he has a boy he is happy and overjoyed and [(الليالي الملاح)google translate:navigator\nnights,don't know what it is referring to] and happy times. And this a problem of trusting Allah (tawakul)\nand from the doing of Jahilyah. [The host]: do you see sheikh that in our\ntime with the explosion of means of communication and social media and how easy haram is that\ngirls need more hugs love and affection than boys. Sheikh: true, otherwise she would seek it...\nboth: elsewhere"
