  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh May Allah make you among the people of paradise Sheikh And you as well Ameen But the issue is the books that are returned, some of them are kufr, contain kufr or shirk or they have like improper pictures on them of women uncovered Am I right in doing this because I don't know if it's, am I sinful for like, but this job Wa Jazakum So such books that contain haram, ideally you should not deal with them And you would not be sinful for returning them back on the shelves where they're supposed to be Because sometimes even kufr books can be a reference for Muslims So he does need references and these references are the ones that you're putting back on the shelves So if there is no one else to do this job, you inshallah can do it and Allah knows best Thank you for watching!"
