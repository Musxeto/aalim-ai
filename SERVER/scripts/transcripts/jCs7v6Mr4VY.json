  "transcript": "Arabi from Bangladesh so Sheikh I need a passport but you have to expose the ears as well as the face so uh my father my whole family is going to India for a better treatment for my mother and sister and while doing that my father also wants to get my chronic back pain checked up and also checked up I also check my whole body so to apply for the Visa I had to expose my ears but I tried my best to do so without exposing my hair so what I did was this permissible and since I already applied for the Visa will it be permissible for me to travel this unfortunately is a necessity that some countries mandate and I don't know why they do these things especially with the new technology that enables them to recognize a person from his facial features or biometric um features or whatever they call so the eyes is sufficient why do you need the ears and just to see if he's a kangaroo or or an elephant ears or what is this it's it's more likely just to humilate yeah any the Muslims and force them to do this unfortunately but due to necessity Scholars say that this is permissible and your Visa is valid you can travel and you can issue such a passport foreign"
