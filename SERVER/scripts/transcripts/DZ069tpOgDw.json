  "transcript": "from Bangladesh how are you doing sure I'm getting old but I'm doing fine alhamdulillah you know that Hadith where the Prophet wasam said that three people will be the furthest from him on the day of judgment one of them is one who talks too much could you please teach me on how to refrain from talking too much and what should a good Muslim talk about that would be beneficial for the um I don't know the Hadith you're referring to but it is true that Allah hates for us chitchatting and gossiping because it mainly would make people fall into sin when they talk a lot however talking depends on the quality of it and when one of the salaf may Allah have mercy on them all was asked you talk a lot so he said by good or by bad they said no by good you teach us the you teach us Hadith and you teach us uh um things in and you give us reminders and you soften our hearts but heck you talk a lot so he says as long as what I say pleases Allah and would make my scale of Good Deeds heavy on the day of judgment then so should you guys do you should follow suit so what counts is the quality of what you say it's true sometimes people don't talk at all they don't speak at all but they're sinful because they see evil in front of them and they do not forbid it they see people in need of advice and they do not uh offer It While others who speak a lot but when you analyze what comes out of their mouths you find that it's beneficial for the umah it's a reminder it's a Hadith it's a Quran it's something that reconciles between fighting factions then this type of rhetoric and talk is positive by all account and Allah Knows Best"
