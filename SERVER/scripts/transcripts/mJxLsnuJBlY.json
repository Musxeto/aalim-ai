  "transcript": "my question is if someone intentionally stopped the defecation to go to urge uh and some form of sweat forms on the back near anas uh will the government become impure or the who become invalid i don't understand your question did you defecate or not no no if i don't defecate some form of sweat form one bike off my anus okay i will answer he deen says if a person sweats and the sweat is so excessive that it touches the anus and there is a smell there is a color don't allow shaytan to mess up with your mind when it comes to issues of purity ask yourself normal and general questions one did the companions of the prophet assam use hard substances to cleanse themselves from traces of feces and after defecating or water the vast majority did not use water so do you mean to tell me that this would not leave some traces it has to leave some traces yet these minute traces are negligible the issue of smell the issue of color this cannot be purified forever especially at that area which is notoriously known for the odor and for the color so don't allow shaytan to mess up with your head saying that okay if sweat comes and then i find traces of sweat on my underwear and may find some traces of color then this means my prayer is invalid i have to take a shower before every prayer i spend half an hour cleaning myself all of this is from shaytaan messing up with your head you"
