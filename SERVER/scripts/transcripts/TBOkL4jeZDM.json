  "transcript": "passion from saudi okay so my question is i have friends and sometimes they make jokes and i love and then after like some time i remember i have like doubts that i don't know whether to make fun of islam or no one i'm questioning should i do toba or no can you like tell me what to do and how to solve this problem hashim if you don't know whether this takes you out of the fold of islam or not whether it's haram or not how would i know uh yeah okay okay i will try to answer generally inshallah hashem says my friends joke around and and i laugh and later on i think was this permissible or not did they say something kuffar or not the default is that when someone says something funny it's okay to laugh unless proven otherwise so if you don't find this quote unquote otherwise if you don't detect any haram if you don't hear anything that is kufur then you shouldn't be doubtful about it"
