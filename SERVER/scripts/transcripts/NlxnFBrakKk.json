  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Qatar. Sheikh, I have excused fast from Ramadan that I \ndidn't fast around [ ] week for valid reasons. And when I wanted to make them up, I fasted [ ] and then I fasted the white days and then I also fasted Monday and \nThursday and I made up the whole days. And then my mom said to me \nthat the [ ], it's by itself,   it doesn't count when you have \nfast that you need to make up. And she says she's not sure about \nMonday and Thursday and the white days. So I checked online and it's \ntrue that [ ] is by itself,   but I'm not sure about the other days \nif they count, did I make up my fast, are they by themselves or what. Can you please \nshed some light on this, Jazak Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum It is an issue of dispute and \nthe most authentic opinion   is the opinion we always \nremind brothers and sisters of. That is, you can combine making \nup for missed days of Ramadan   in Ashura, in Arafah, in the white days \nevery month, in Thursdays and Mondays. And this is the opinion of the great scholar, \nSheikh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen, may   Allah have mercy on his soul. So his opinion states that Allah Azza wa Jal,   put the reward of expiating the \nsins of a year if you fast Ashura. So if you combine that with fasting \na day, making up a day of Ramadan,   there's no problem in that because you \nare hitting two birds with one stone. And Allah's mercy is greater than that."
