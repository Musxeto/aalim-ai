  "transcript": "Suhaib Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh uh so sheikh my question is uh i saw like a clip of a video on you like uh you know like a few years ago saying that the person you know in the barzakh world everybody actually no one knows their position whether they're going to go in jannah or jahannam but like i found some evidences that were a bit contradictory such as the hadith also like in the cup you know either they're going to see their place in jahannam if they done bad and they're going to see their place in jannah and then the one who wants to the one who will be in jahannam he will ask allah and then the one who wants to uh when he sees his position in jannah he says so i'm a bit like confused on uh on on how he would not know where his position is if there's a bunch of evidences such as these it would have been much easier for you meet you to ask me the question without giving me the history because i definitely don't remember what i had for lunch a couple of days ago let alone what i said couple of decades or couple of years ago if you would have asked me i would have told you yes the people in the grave are divided into two types one type that have the glad tidings and they know that their final adobe is to jannah and the others are who were giving the bad omens and uh news that they are disbelievers and they are guaranteed a seat in hellfire and each one would have a window from jannah or from hell where the fragrances or the fumes would come and fill their graves and there are people who are in between who are muslims but they will be tormented in their graves whether for backbiting for namima slandering others for gossiping or for not cleaning themselves from urine and on the day of judgment they will be held accountable for their sins etc maybe do some time in hell but eventually will go to paradise but i don't know what the clip you saw and by the way this is a disclaimer a lot of the people come to me and i mean a lot and say yeah sheikh you said so and so and so and i reflect and find out in 95 that what they're quoting is wrong but they misunderstood it and when i sometimes correct them they say oh sorry sorry sorry sheikh so it is totally unacceptable from my side for someone to say i i saw a clip for you and you said so and so and so but i have to see the clip myself so if i was wrong i would correct it but i would not take your word for it a brother called me yesterday on a counseling session and he said yeah sheikh i saw a clip for you um on twitter someone asked you about blowing um and and you said that this is not permissible in athkar but you always told me that bedtime athkar we blow and wipe over our bodies i said okay the question in the twitter was what's the ruling on blowing the athkar of the morning and the evening on my children and i said no this is not permissible this is not from the sunnah so oh subhanallah i did not pay attention to that not only that i said even the athkar of the bedtime uh athkar you don't blow and wipe over your bodies it's only the three last quls that you blow then recite then wipe over your body so 99.9 percent when someone comes to me said you said so and so i don't i discredit it i don't believe them because i have to see it myself and 99.99 percent i see it and i find out that they were misunderstanding they missed something they did not figure it out and they apologize so i hope this answers your question we have a you"
