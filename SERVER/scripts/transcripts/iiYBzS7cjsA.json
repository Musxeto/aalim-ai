  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. So we know that we're not supposed to take anything from our hair when we, if you want to do like a Udhiyya. If you want to do what? Udhiyya, the Qurbani. Udhiyya, okay. So what about if a woman wants to do her hair for the heat, like a day or two before the heat, wants to go to a hairdresser and do her hair, when they're doing the hair, obviously there's going to be hair that comes out when they're Qurbani. What is, is that allowed? Okay, the hadith you're referring to is authentic where the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said when a person intends to offer the sacrifice of Al-Hajj, known as Udhiyya, then he must refrain from his hair and body, meaning he should not clip his nails, he should not shave or pluck his or remove any body hair. Now this applies to the person who is intending to sacrifice, not his household. So if you as a woman intend to do this, this is prohibited for you until the sacrifice is slaughtered. Once it's slaughtered on the day of Eid, this is fine. Going to the hairdresser and fixing yourself up, whether it is by perming your hair or by smoothening it, there's nothing wrong in that. Whatever falls from your hair when you comb it or brush it, this has nothing to do with your Udhiyya. Cutting and fixing is what is prohibited. Therefore there's nothing wrong in going to the hairdresser for fixing your hairstyle without using scissors or plucking it, normal brushing or combing it does not impact your Udhiyya."
