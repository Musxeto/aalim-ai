  "transcript": "brother abdullah from germany you have a question regarding istikhara if if we have three options and should i do sahara for all of them and how do i know in the end that which one is better for me or or someone also said to me that um that whatever allah does after sahara is the answer of the okay i will answer inshallah first of all brother abdullah you have to know that istihara is not a process process of selection so i have this 911 turbo 2 and i have this uh ferrari and i don't know which one to buy a replica of course not the real thing i don't have money so which one to buy so i said oh okay let me praise tihara and see what happens after praying is tahara maybe some light would shine or lightning or i would hear thunder or i would have a dream no no no no this is not a stihara at all it has nothing to do with istihara so the moment you said that i have three choices istihara doesn't work here why see istihara is asking allah azzawajal to choose for me okay i have three choices which one to choose oh allah choose for me no no no no go back to the basics what is or what are the basics the basis basics are learned from the hadith the prophet said in the authentic when someone attempts to do something oh not to select one of three or two options rather he had already done his selection and now his mind is set for choosing this particular thing the other options are out of the picture only then you press the hara and say oh allah if this thing that i have selected and i'm attempting to do tomorrow or next week if there is good in it for me in this life and the hereafter in all my affairs then make it happen and facilitate it for me if not then distract me from it take it away substitute me with something that is better and make me happy with that which you have substituted me with so from this hadith this is the hadith of the sahara by the way the prayer prayer of two raka's and saying that afterwards it clearly states that you've selected not that i have two sisters or three sisters that i'm interested in marrying and i don't know which one to pick and choose so i praise the hara no i have to do my short listing yeah this one is tall this one is short this one is religious this one is fluent in arabic this one knows the quran this one knows how to cook and i come to the conclusion that okay i'll choose number three done done now i praise tehara and the following day i go with the proposal if there is any good in it it will happen if not something would happen and i won't feel good they would reject me things would come up and then i i would be turned off from that and then i would know how it worked and allah azza knows best"
