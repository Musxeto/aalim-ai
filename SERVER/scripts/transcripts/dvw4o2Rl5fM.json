  "transcript": "Muhammad Taha from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I wanted to ask about if we are allowed to make vows such as saying that I won't do certain sin from now on or not? Jazak Allah So making vows and committing yourself is something that is not recommended in Islam if there is compensation or something in return. So the Prophet ï·º said he prohibited us from making vows and he stated that this is only means of extracting wealth from someone who is stingy or a miser. How? I'm not going to give charity in normal conditions but because my son is going to have an exam tomorrow and it's an important exam I say O Allah I vow to give a sheep or a goat, slaughter it and give it to the poor if my son brings A grades in his test. If my son did not have a test I would not have done this vow. So this is means of extracting wealth from someone who is miser or stingy. What you're saying is I vow not to make this particular sin. You don't have to vow because it is prohibited for you to make such a sin in Islam. So putting a vow extra upon yourself is adding burden to yourself which is not something that is promoted by Islam and it's not permissible and Allah knows best."
