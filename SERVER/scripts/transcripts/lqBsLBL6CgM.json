  "transcript": "We have Chengiz from Kazakhstan. Sheikh, what advice can you give me on how to teach and encourage my younger brother to practice Islam? Who is 12 years old. I came to Islam a few years ago and my mom did 6 months ago. And only now I'm starting to like give him dawah, my brother. And he believes in Islam but does not practice anything. For example, when I tell him not to listen to music, he just avoids me. Okay, I'll tell you Chengiz because we're out of time. First of all, may Allah Azza Wa Jal put a lot of barakah in your dawah for your mom and for your brother and for all those around you. Number two, you have to focus on the essentials, not the symptoms of the illness. Don't look for listening to music, smoking, watching movies. These are symptoms of the illness. Focus on the chronic illness itself. How? Focus on teaching your brother the beautiful names of Allah. Focus on teaching your brother how to love Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salaam through his biography. Focus on taking one or two ayahs every day that speaks about Allah, the Day of Judgment, the messengers, the scriptures, the angels, the essential pillars of Iman. Little by little, this would cement Iman in his heart and it will increase him in Iman and get him closer and closer where it will eliminate all symptoms of sins and illnesses that you are referring to and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
