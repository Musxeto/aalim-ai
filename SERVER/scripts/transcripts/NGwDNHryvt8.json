  "transcript": "we will go to the second uh question inshallah the second question is uh why do people think that if you read muhammad ibn allah his books that you are misguided that's the third question what about the second well the second uh was about innovation but you already answered it in uh okay good so why would anyone consider reading the books of muhammad a misguidance very simple you are ignorant of what you don't know so if you ask anyone who tells you ah you've studied the books of muhammad abdul wahab you're misguided say to them i can agree with that on one condition tell me where is the misguidance in his books he will tell you ah because you will become extremist you will become a fundamentalist you will become a jihadi you will kill people you will give the fear to people how do you know that the i heard people say that masha'allah have you ever read any of his books no i don't have to people excuse me have you or haven't you sorry i haven't then how can you judge me who have read his books learnt a lot of them just based on what people say this is total ignorance so you don't have to respond to ignorant people when people come and say to your face and by the way they can they used to come to me and say this a lot especially haters when they say oh shih haasen you're an ass should i be angry no i'd say i say to them true this is my name as i am this is how they spell my name as i am so when people come and say you're an ass does this mean i'm gonna grow two ears and a tail no let them say whatever they want good people say good words bad people say bad words i'm not going to be affected by that so those who criticize those who speak ill about the books of imam muhammad and abdul wahab are one of two either a deviant or a deviant sufi there's no third why because the books of muhammad ibn abdul wahab speak about akida about returning people to sunnah about purifying our beliefs from innovations and this is what the shia and the sufis thrive on this is how they live and they cannot keep their congregation their followers they cannot use them and buy them and utilize what they have if they started to read the books of muhammad and rabbi which basically are so i hope this answers your question you"
