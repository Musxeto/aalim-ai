  "transcript": "ibraim from uh G Guinea inah you'll get the name right one day is it is it Guinea or yeah it's Guinea okay it's right huh uh she I have a question here I asked on Twitter what you said it was too generic so I'll try to give a little bit details here actually I know a mother who sent her son to go to some kind of I don't know magician black magic or something allow those lines to be washed basically because they were thinking that maybe there something possessed the the guy or things about that nature you understand so now um the the the guy actually when he came back from that one day we were talking he told me that actually I never went back again because it felt awkward and I even starting to believe in these things so I left it may I told him actually I think you should repent because what you did actually in orig is quite serious I believe maybe it's kuur or or something like that uh and actually I wanted to ask if these people don't repent basically the one who accompanied him there him himself and the mother if they don't repent but they continue fasting and praying and everything what's the ruling on that and how can I advise them to actually repent first of all um ibraim it is not our job to label people as disbelievers this is a very dangerous uh uh route to take so they've done something according to the policy and procedure is an act of kufur to go to soothsayers and believe in them and believe that they have a solution or they know the Unseen or they can do this and that this is an act of apostasy or kufur we cannot label them as such until we ensure that the conditions are fulfilled and that there are no obstacles present Maybe they would say that no they're not soothsayers they're using Quran maybe they are misinterpreting things or confused or don't have the necessary knowledge so this is not your job to do you did your due diligence and you've explained to them the gravity of the situation move on and leave them"
