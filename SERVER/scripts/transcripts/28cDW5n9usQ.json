  "title": "Folding clothes For prayer, Makrooh or Haram? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "fat says folding clothes in the prayer is this like is it disliked act or prohibited what is the difference between disliked act or prohibited macro and halam so makru is what a person does and he's not sinful but if he abandons it for the sake of allah he's rewarded and likewise if a person does it he's sinful but if he leaves it for the sake of allah he's rewarded so he's asking now folding the clothes for prayer is this considered to be disliked or prohibited the jurors differed because in essence as the scholars of us say that whenever a prohibition is stated then this is by default something that is sinful unless other evidences from the quran or the sunnah would demote it into macro so for example when the prophet salallahu salaam prohibits us from drinking while standing up there is a prohibition there's a hadith so what is the ruling on that the default is the prohibition do not drink standing up means that it is prohibited and you're sinful if you do it now this prohibition was actually let's start from the bottom this prohibition was promoted and made less in civility into macro and some say into even permissible when the prophet himself was as in sahih drank zamzam water while standing up now we have two sort of conflicting evidences don't drink standing up and he drank standing up so let's see what the companions say we go also insane fourth caliph the cousin of the prophet sallam and the son-in-law of the prophet haslam the husband of fatima he says i don't care whether i drink standing up or sitting down four i had seen the prophet islam drink standing up so what does that tell us it tells us that drinking standing up is not halal however it is definitely more rewarding just to drink sitting down due to the prohibition in the beginning not to drink standing up so likewise when we come to the hadith that do not fold your clothes when you want to pray the default is this is an instruction in order not to do something which mean it is prohibited and sinful unless proven otherwise do we have any proof technically speaking no however the majority of scholars say that this is not sinful rather it is makru where did they get this understanding from do they have any evidences the answer is no but the jurors tend to demote or promote a ruling if they could not find the reason or the justification for it so they say that ah this is something that is related to nothing of halal rather it is humanly better where did you get this from i don't know it sounded good so they say yeah it sounds good okay you agree i agree so the majority say for example eating with your left hand is makru what the hadith is crystal clear yeah it is christopher but we don't know the point to make it haram so we say that it is makru and sometimes by them saying makru like in the hanafi school of thought they have two types of makru makru not recommended and macro prohibited they call it kalahatu tahrir and this is something that a student of knowledge has to be careful when studying so that he would learn the terminology used by the jurors of a particular school of thought in before jumping to conclusions so the default is the hadith is crystal clear it is prohibited to fold your clothes when you pray so part of the folding of the clothes is this if i am doing this and just before prayer i do this this is folding i should not do that and pray like that folding your sleeves i should not do that one says okay sheikh what about if i have my pants below my ankles i say 24 7. you're sinful whether you're praying or not but due to the fact that prayer one has to do the level best not to be in a state of sin we tell you you've you've got to fold this because it's the lesser of the two evils and allah azza knows best you"
