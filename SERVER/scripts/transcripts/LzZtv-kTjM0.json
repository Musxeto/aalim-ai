  "transcript": "muhammmad from the Philippines says what is the best time to sleep now this is not very uh uh clearcut question because times differ people differ and the preferences definitely differ what was the preference of the Prophet Alam it it goes without questioning that the prophet Alam hated sleeping before so between this is not a time to sleep and hated speaking and meeting others after so this means that the best time to sleep is after praying Isa unfortunately nowadays cultures and and communities don't follow this except in maybe villages in rural areas but in cities the the the average time of going to bed is like maybe 11 or 12:00 at night midnight some people go even further so as long as you are capable of functioning and observing your Salat of F and night prayer and tud and waking up for and the rest of the prayers then you okay to do whatever you wish and Allah knows"
