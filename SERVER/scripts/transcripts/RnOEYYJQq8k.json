  "title": "How can a couple develop love & compassion; youngsters prefer divorce nowadays",
  "transcript": "a sister says how should a husband and a wife develop love and companionship among each other as divorce rate is on the rise these days and youngsters have become very intolerant of each other and they don't think divorce is such a big deal because they say this is something halal so it's better to move on than live miserably this is a big problem and I face this problem because I do counseling sessions and it ham Dalila we've managed to solve so many marital problems which most of them are based on eye-opening the wife thinks that she is not receiving her rights while the husband thinks that he's not receiving his rights and both parties only care about their rights and no one ever asks about their obligations not only that we tend to only see the short comings of the other side rather than seeing the good side so many sisters call and they complained about their husbands and I stopped them and I say don't mention anything bad about your husband tell me what's good in him and she starts saying I can't it's a very long list which consumed the half hour that we have together so I said subhanAllah all these good things in him can't overwhelm and cover these short comings of his these small faults they're trivial and they managed to open their eyes and season oops subhanAllah how ungrateful I were I was so couples need tutoring need to know what their rights but also what their obligations are they need to know the seer of the Prophet a sermon how he used to deal with his why and how he used to tolerate them they have to know how important a man should be to his wife and her obligations towards him and at the same time a man has to know how to value his wife how to cherish her and to be good to her because the Prophet said as soon the best of you is the best two of you to his wives and I'm the best among you to his wives so these things can't come in a small capsule that you swallow and voila you become mashallah a super hero it needs knowledge it needs training it needs tolerance it needs to look from different angles to understand what is happening otherwise life and marriage would not go on this requires a lot of talk that cannot be covered in answering a Q&A session"
