  "transcript": "And finally, the third question is from Ahmed;   'What's the ruling on listening to Qur'ān while \nsleeping every day?' I usually play the Qur'ān   in bed and sleep off while it's \nstill playing. Is this considered   disrespectful?' The answer is, 'No'. There \nis no disrespect in this none whatsoever.   Going to bed while listening to the Qur'ān and \nfalling asleep while the Qur'ān is being played   is totally permissible, and there's nothing wrong \nin that. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
