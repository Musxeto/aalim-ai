  "title": "Unable to finish a task or project | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "her saying says I always start a new project and fail projects like memorizing last jusa of the Quran but don't carry on for even two days start with trying to finish long Islamic books but fail to finish even 5% start with learning Arabic with a long video playlist but fail please give me some suggestions okay first of all not all of us are cut to do something like that for example I have an obsession or a wish that I would study Spanish as a new language but I'm unable to find the time I know I can pick it up in couple of months or three months if I travel if I put my head and self to it but there is no time to it so does this mean that I have to depress myself some people come and say I've tried to go to medical school but I failed two or three years miserably you're not cut for it this is not something that Allah had made it easy for you so don't be depressed because each one of us has something that makes him click and maybe among those things you did not find your target yet secondly things that we do individually we may fail miserably but when we do it with others or in a classroom or in a group we find that we are progressing so my advice to you is first of all to motivate yourself second of all not to burden yourself with with so much load and thirdly take partners to be with you in each and every project so with once you want to read a long Islamic book take a friend and say okay we will read today five pages and he checks on you at the end of the day and see your progress report and encourages you to do this better and more in the future and LA knows best"
