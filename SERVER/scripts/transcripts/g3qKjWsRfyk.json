  "transcript": "Abdul Hadi from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, how are you? Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. I'm fine Alhamdulillah. So Sheikh, I watched one of your videos which was about four years old and I was confused whether to say like in Salah we say Rabbana Walakal Hamd after we stand up that was what I thought and when I watched one of your videos that was four years old it said you said that yes when we rise up then we say it but I saw another one of your videos which was a couple of months ago in it you said while we are rising then we say Rabbana Walakal Hamd when we're in congregation so I'm confused which when should I say it? What's the difference between the two? First is when I rise up like completely when I'm fully fully standing then I say it or when I'm rising like while rising okay first of all it is to be said while rising now to rise from Ruku' to standing up is like a second and a half to say Rabbana Walakal Hamd this is probably three seconds so inevitably while you're rising you say Rabbana Walakal Hamd you will be concluding half of it while in the standing position what is not recommended is to say it when you are fully erected and you say Rabbana Walakal Hamd. Why? These statements are known as Takbiratul Intiqal, the Takbir of movement a lot of people when they are in the standing position and they want to go to sujood imams especially they go ahead and make sujood and once they touch the ground they say Allahu Akbar and this is wrong because they said Allahu Akbar which is movement of Takbir of movement after they reached some of them know they do the opposite while they're standing they say Allahu Akbar so that their voice would reach the microphone and then they go for Ruku' or for sujood and this is problematic because the moment they say Allahu Akbar everybody behind them would go for the Ruku' or for the sujood so they would be ahead of the imam which is very wrong this is not correct it is to be said while in between the positions while moving so likewise when the imam says you rise and say Rabbana Walakal Hamd maybe you rise you say Rabbana and immediately you're standing up Walakal Hamd there is no problem in that and Allah knows best"
