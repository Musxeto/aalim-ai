  "transcript": "NAA from the UK Alum allum Salam if I put cream on my skin must I wash it off before doing woodo or can I just wash it un wash and rub while doing woodoo as I know that the water will reach the skin from rubbing washing it creams usually are absorbed by the skin and it does not form a layer that would prevent water from reaching the skin yes it might have some feeling to it but it is not a barrier as in the case when you have paint or uh nail polish on your hand which is a true layer so as long as you applied your cream and then when you want to perform woodo you wash and rub the the the organ this is fine inshallah la"
