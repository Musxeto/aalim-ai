  "transcript": "Tasos says sure I want to ask you about social security system this means we pay to the government every month about $10 and we and when we reach our age at 60 the government will give us a pension every month of about $100 it is permissible to join this I hope you understand shukran well cos by what you're asking about is known as the social security I think they can call it also as Provident Fund or funding and the way it is done in so many countries it is one of two either it is mandatory upon employees and they have no say in it so in some Muslim countries whether you like it or not if you're working for the government the government before giving you your paycheck at the end of the month they take off your salary 10% and they inject from their own funding 10% and they put it in an account they invest it or whatever if your object and say I don't want anything to do with it they say it's not up to you even in some Gulf countries this is imposed upon the private sector not only the government sector or the public sector even the private sector they are forced by law that they should deduct a certain percentage of the employees wage and they inject a similar percentage by force by law and this stays until the employee reaches the age of retirement whether it's 60 65 it depends from country to country the thing that is forced upon you it is halal to benefit from because this is something that the government at the end of your employment pays from its Treasury its own Treasury whether they invested it in her arm whether they invested it with RIBA interest or elsewhere this is not your job now after retirement the government that is supposed to take care of me is paying me money on monthly basis for my retirement there is nothing wrong with that insha'Allah Sojin what is not permissible is when there is a voluntary scheme of Provident funds so if there is a company a third party or the government says listen you want to contribute in the Social Security system that we have then you have to pay X amount of money and the terms of the contract is so and so after you reach 60 we give you $100 a month thousand dollars a month depending on the years of service and your average of the last three salaries before retirement this is haram why like the 104k in the states for example when of it when it's optional why is it Haram because the idea of it is like gambling at the age of 60 you worked only 20 or 30 years you've invested with them X amount of money there is a possibility that you may live until you are a hundred so this is an extra 40 years which consumes all what you have deposited in the 30 or 35 years of service plus lots lots more than that and there is a possibility when you're 60 and you retired next week you die so all what you have given them over the past 30 or 35 of years is gone down the drain and this is like insurance why is insurance Haram because it's gambling and also it involves RIBA why is it gambling I'm paying a premium of two thousand or three thousand dollars a month for health care and during the whole year I never get sick so my money is down the drain next year I pay the same third year fourth year and I end up paying for twenty thirty forty years without having any problem or any need to go to a hospital they're making money of my back another person joins in the scheme pays a premium second week they find that he is in early stages of cancer so they spend a hundred thousand dollars in treatment medication came with therapy rehabilitation and the whole nine yards and he has won a deal for two thousand dollars I get so many expenses likewise if he undergoes a surgery delivery etc so it's gambling and it's Haram the only option out of it is cooperative insurance which to my knowledge there isn't a real company that is fulfilling the Islamic conditions in such a case therefore cause us if it is mandatory upon you go ahead and use it without any problem if it's not then you have to come out of it"
