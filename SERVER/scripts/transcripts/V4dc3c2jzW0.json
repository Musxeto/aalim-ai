  "title": "Can I answer my teacher in front of nonmahram men without beautifying my voice? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Khadija from Morocco Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my question is, is it permissible for me to give answer to teacher's questions in class if male students are present? If it's a straightforward question answer and without beautifying my voice? Originally, the best scenario and the Islamic scenario is to avoid any free mixed classes like this. But for those who live in the West and have no other option, and if the woman is totally covered and abiding by the hijab, segregating herself from male students and teachers, answering the question directly is no problem because the voice of a woman is not a awrah. They used to speak at the time of the Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, in the presence of male companions. And that would not be frowned at or looked down upon. So yes, the answer is no problem in answering as long as it's straightforward without beautifying your voice and Allah knows best."
