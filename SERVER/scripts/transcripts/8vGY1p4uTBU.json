  "transcript": "the second question is from a brother who says can i recite quran from my memory or while holding the mushaf in my cl if my clothes have impurity we know that purity or tahara has to be found when we pray and purity is divided into two types uplifting the hadith and removing the najas the hadith is something that cannot be seen it can be a major ritual impurity or a minor ritual impurity this is removed by russell in the case of major or by performing wado in the case of minor ritual impurity the second part is removing the najas the physical impurity that we all can see and this has to be purified from our bodies number two our clothes number three the places we're praying on in order for our prayers to be valid this is regarding prayer when we come to reciting the mushaf scholars say that you only have to uplift your minor ritual impurity if you want to hold a copy of the must-have but if you're reciting it from memory or you're reciting it from a pda or an electronic device then wudu is not needed or required neither is the the purity of the spot you're sitting on or your body and clothes these are not required because this is not a prayer that does not mean that you should take matters lightly and say it's no problem it is no problem but isn't it better in a higher level when you purify your body and clothes whenever you want to recite the quran answer is definitely yes but this is not the question the question is would by would my recitation be prohibited or unaccepted if there are impurities on my clothes the answer is no your recitation of the quran and your form of worship of reciting the quran has no impact whether you have impurity or not is not affected you"
