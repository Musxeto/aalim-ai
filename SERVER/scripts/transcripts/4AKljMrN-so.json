  "title": "Husband prevents his wife from meeting with blood relatives | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a Muslim girl says I want to ask how blood relationships work like for some reasons a husband says to his wife that do not meet your this and that relative so will she be held accountable for not meeting those relatives even if she says Salam in a good way whether she meets that whenever she meets them woman her husband tells her do not speak to so-and-so of your relatives is he allowed to do this this depends on his intention and if he has a legitimate reason or not but let us take it step by step he is either telling you not to speak to naan mahaan such as your male cousins or he is telling you to speak not to speak to moms like uncles brothers etc in the first category he has all the right to tell you not to speak to none mahomes and you would be sinful even if he permits you to speak to them if you do speak to them your cousins are nan Muharram what do we mean by nan Muharram in the States if a person has a cousin they treat her as a sister they cannot marry her and this is totally false and baseless in Islam a cousin is a cousin the one you are not allowed to marry or your mother your sister your daughter your paternal or maternal aunt your niece from your brother or your sister these are permanently Muharram to you but your male cousins are not Muharram for me my female cousins are not Muharram I can marry them which means that shaitaan can come in between so he has all the right to prevent you now coming to the other side which is your mom if he tells you do not communicate with your father your brother your paternal or maternal uncle your nephews he has no right to order you to do this because this is severing the kinship and if he does you do not obey him but he has the right to tell you not to bring them home or not to go to their homes because he may have a legitimate reason and you must obey Him but not to communicate or to talk to them no he has no right in doing that and you can easily disobey him in this but try to be diplomatic and do it behind his back"
