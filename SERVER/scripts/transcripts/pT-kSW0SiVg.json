  "transcript": "Hashim from India. Sheikh, can we say the morning adhkar between the adhan and the Iqamah Fajr prayer? Yes, indeed you can. The moment the adhan is given, this means that's the break of dawn. Even if you did not pray the sunnah or the fard yet, you can say your morning adhkar without a problem inshaAllah."
