  "transcript": "others may listen to the quran yet still they abandon it how they're listening to it they are reading it they're doing this for the sake of baraka they just want the blessing a lot of the people play the quran 24 hours seven days a week as if it's background music they're not listening to it and if you ask them which surah is this so i don't know what was the last ayah the man just recited i don't know so why are you listening to the quran he said it's barakah it's better than not listening to anything some people study or work out while listening to the quran without paying any attention to it and this is not what the quran was revealed for"
