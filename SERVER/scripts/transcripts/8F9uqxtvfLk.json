  "transcript": "Irene from Cyprus Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam As per the hadith, the one who maintains reciting Ayatul Kursi after every Fard prayer, nothing will prevent him or her from entering Paradise. In the case of menstruating women, how should this hadith be followed? Okay, this hadith relates to those who pray those who are exempted from prayer like women in their menses are not included in being sinful. So this six or seven days, they are exempted from it. And what counts are the days they pray in. As long as they pray their five times a day and they recite Surah Ayatul Kursi afterwards, they're included in the hadith. When they have their excuse, they're exempted and forgiven, and they're not held accountable for that. And Allah knows best."
