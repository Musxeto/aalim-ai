  "transcript": "uh harun from the us had a question about in reference to uh the mother's distribution of her property to the children okay after she passed gone does she have to follow the distribution limits as stated in the quran while she's living and as she's as she passed on i mean that's my question i don't understand the question the mother is dead no the mother's still alive okay she wants to distribute her wealth while alive to her children yes and well well not she wants to make she wants to make uh like let's say a a a a will saying that that to while she's well when she dies that she will distribute certain uh property to her children but she doesn't want to do it uh she uh she wants to do it the way she wants to do what she okay got your question got your question we will deliver inshallah haroon from the us says that there is a mom who'd like to distribute her wealth after her death not accordance according to islam so she wants to write a will she has a son and three daughters for example and she wants to write half of the property or everything that is residential to her son and the girls only gets the gold for example this is prevailing in in some countries this will is invalid and they may not complain let it be but after her death they tear it up and throw it in the dustbin because it was the command of the prophet isaiah when he said that there is no will between brackets valid to someone who will inherit or an heir so the heirs of a person cannot be given something extra as part of the will to what allah has already divided my wife after my death gets by default 1 8 and the rest goes for my children so if i write a will that i allocate this house to my wife in addition to her 1 8th or maybe the house constitutes two-thirds of my wealth i have nothing except this house house and some cash in the bank so i say in my will this goes to her this is an invalid will on the spot because she has one eighth of my wealth i can't give her a penny extra to that this is a division of allah azza now if the mother wants to distribute her wealth while alive she can do that providing that she's equal between all of her children not giving one extra otherwise she is sinful for that and if she writes the will regardless defying allah's commands when she dies she's going to punish for that because she has gone against allah's law you"
