  "transcript": "um zeyneb says I have two daughters 3.5 years and one-year-old the eldest always is always given importance in the house by my mother-in-law when she hits the younger one my mother-in-law never wants me to shout at the elder one I do as she says I explained to her nicely all the time but my eldest daughter never stops sometimes I feel once in a while I should shout at her and let her know that it is not acceptable but I'm not allowed first of all I know this may sound shocking but she is your daughter and you are not the daughter of your mother-in-law you're not obliged to obey your mother-in-law yes she's an elder woman you respect her you're beautiful to her it's not my obligation to take orders from you you my mother-in-law I love you I respect you because of my husband but you have no jurisdiction neither on me Norman I am interested to bring up my children you may argue and say I brought up your husband well maybe you did not do a good job maybe you did but this is not my concern this is not my business my children are my business you are not allowed to tell me what to do and what not to do you give me an advice may Allah reward you just like a long lion if I take it or not this is up to me so um Jana you have the green light to ignore your mother-in-law's remark and you have to take care of bringing your eldest daughter reprimanding her advising her shouting at her so that she acknowledges when she did wrong by not shouting at her shouting meaning any telling a child is 3.5 years old you shouting is not like holding a horn speaker and and and and blow her ears off shouting me what did you do don't do that this is totally permissible and there's no problem in that"
