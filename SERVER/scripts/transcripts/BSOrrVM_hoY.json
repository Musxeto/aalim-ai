  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Is it permissible to take credit cards and loans from Islamic banks? Akhi, why do you ask these questions? Now, the answer, see I can say yes or no, but I wouldn't do you justice. You guys are in a university. You are intellectual people. So if I speak nonsense, you say boo. And maybe you'll throw me with rotten tomatoes. When you say Islamic banks, let it be known to all. No Islamic bank will lend you money. Why? Because the concept of lending means that I give you something and you give it back. And there is no such charity organization that does this. So what does an Islamic bank do? An Islamic bank sells you a commodity. So they sell you this gadget. The market price is 4,000 ringgit. It's a pro by the way. It's not for sale. So it's 4,000 ringgit cash. But because they are interested in making a profit, they give it to you in installments for 5,000. And you pay it off on the duration of 10 months. Which means that you do the math. I'm not good in math. So this is how it happens. You take it from them. You go outside. As-salamu alaykum. Anybody interested? You sell it probably for 4,500, 4,200, 300. And you take the cash and you do whatever you want with it and pay them in installments. This is not a lending. Lending is giving you 1,000 ringgit. You return it back 1,010 or 1,100. This is totally haram and prohibited in Islam, in Judaism, in Christianity. It's called usury. And the Jews are the best in it. If you go to the financing institutions, you'll find usually they are the head of it. So is it halal? If it is, as I've described, there are two conditions. Number one, the bank owns the commodity. Why? Because most banks, Islamic, they're not Islamic. Do you go to them and say, I'd like to buy this gadget? Show me your paycheck, your company that you're working for. Okay, you have credit. Okay, I'll sell it to you for 5,100 on the duration of 10 months. Accept? You said, yeah, accept. Okay, sign all this paperwork. Then they go and buy it, cash, 4,000. They obtain it and give it to you. Actually, they did not buy. They're giving you 4,000 and you're paying it back to them, 5,100. This is clear riba. So condition number one, they have to possess it before any commitment. Number two, the final price must be disclosed, 5,010 or 100. So that after 10 months, if you're delayed in payment, they said, okay, it's now 5,200. Because of the late payment fee or 500. This is riba, totally haram. I hope this answers your question."
