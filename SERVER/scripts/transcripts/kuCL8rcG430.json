  "transcript": "From Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my question is when we are in Ruku we know that we need to keep our back straight but is it permissible to also bend my knee in order to keep the back straight because if I keep my leg straight then my back is not going to be straight. Question for you Tariq when you do this posture, anyone looking at you would they say you are in Ruku? Yes or no? I would say yes. Then this is permissible. See in Arabic Ruku is to bend your back whether your knees are straight and flat or bent it doesn't matter. Your back is bent. Now must it be straight? Sometimes I have pain in the lower back so I may arch it a little bit. I may tilt it a little bit. Still people look at me they say I'm in Ruku. Is it the best thing to do? No but still it is valid. So your knees have nothing to do with your Ruku position. Whether you bend them or you keep them straight and Allah knows best."
