  "transcript": "Is it allowed to have a girlfriend that you talk to her with the aim of money? A girlfriend? Yes, if you allow your sister and your daughter to have one, it's okay. Do you allow her? Why? Oh, my sister? No, nobody can take her as a girlfriend. For marriage? It's okay? No, of course not Sheikh, I'm offended. The hell with you. Who cares if you're offended or not. You want to do to other women what you don't want people to do to your own women. Fear Allah Azza Wa Jal. If you are serious, no one asks whether it's okay to take a girlfriend, because if you take a girlfriend, tomorrow when you have daughters, they will take boyfriends. Your sister will go out with someone you don't approve of, or even those you approve of, and it would cause you to have your reputation tarnished, and you will have a scandal. There is no istiqamah except on the Qur'an and the Sunnah. And ask this to any scholar. Is it part of the istiqamah to have girlfriends, boyfriends? Of course not. But my intention is to get married. Even though, if you want to get married, you have to knock the door of the house, not come from the back door or from the window. And what you're doing, no one approves of it or allows it, and the Qur'an and Sunnah does not allow any of this."
