  "transcript": "Milica from Tajikistan says her first question is not very clear but I think she meant that if a person buys a property from a bank or the bank gives a loan for someone and he buys a property with that money or he is in partnership with the bank who is lending him money through interest so now this person wants to get out of this partnership or wants to get rid of his property is it permissible for me to buy it though it was financed through RIBA the answer is yes see the financing is haram but the property is a property it it is not tarnished by the loan he took so this is a pen it's Helen if someone bought it from RIBA or someone bought it from bribe money and then I buy it from him this is permissible because he owned it though through Haram money I bought it through halal money there is nothing nothing wrong in that so I hope that this was your question and the answer is no problem"
