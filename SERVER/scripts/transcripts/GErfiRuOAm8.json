  "title": "Mandatory to use index fingers and thumbs to clean Ears in Wudu",
  "transcript": "Najwa from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Is it mandatory in order for our wudu to be valid that we have to insert our forefinger or our index finger inside the ear while at the same time we use our thumb for the outer ear? I do these actions separately so first I put the index finger and then with the same water I use my thumb for my outer ear. Is this valid? Yes it is valid and it is mandatory to wipe the ears. The Prophet ï·º said the ears are from the head so once you wipe over your head you don't renew the water. With the same hands you just put your index finger inside your ears and the thumbs outside your ear and you do this and that's sufficient for you inshallah. you you you you you you you you you you you"
