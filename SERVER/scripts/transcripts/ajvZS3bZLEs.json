  "title": "Pointing one's feet towards the Quran or Qiblah | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Jelani says have been told that we should not direct or show our legs while sitting or sleeping towards the Qibla and towards the Koran they say that it is a form of disrespecting it please guide me Jelani as muslims and particularly as people from illusion natural german the a leader of our prophet alayhi salatu salam of the the great companions may allah be pleased with them of the tabi een and of those who followed the tambourine may allah have mercy upon them all our leader states that stating something to be good or bad to be beautiful or ugly is not dependent on our logic or our own taste as they say because this is the methodology and the Arpita of el martes allah which is a deviant sect in Islam one of the 73 sects that the Prophet has warned us from sallallahu alayhi wa sallam Muslims believe that stating this is good or bad is dependent on what the Quran says it's dependent on what that prophet alacazam had taught us and this is why Islam is not a religion where logic prevails because logic differs from one person to the other what you see good I may see to be bad it's not something according to our preferences it is according to the Quran and to the swindler someone who passes wind is obliged to perform what someone who burps and gets this wind out of his mouth is not supposed to perform model and if he does then he would be sinful for innovating logically one says it's the same air that is coming out from different passages said it is not something for you to decide it is according to the Quran and to the Sunnah Islam is the religion of cleanliness so when you want to pray you have to wash your limbs three times and you repeat this five times a day washing your body almost fifteen times a day is by all means and standards is something that is clean and beautiful but if I don't have water Islam tells me to strike the soil once white my face and my hands where is the cleanliness logically this is not correct logically is not related to Islam in such aspects because it is a religion of submission not of I will not do what you tell me to do until I believe until I am convinced that it is logical nor audible app this is the methodology of Satan of beliefs Allah tells him prostrate to Adam and he objects and says no I am better than him you created me from fire while he was created from clay so I refused to to prostrate to him so again Jelani when we come to an issue as such which is always prevalent in messages when people recite the Quran they put their backs to the wall and they extend their feet that is they extend their legs with their feet directed to the Qibla and maybe their feet is directed to a place where the Quran is put there and collected the elders usually come and scold him you're not supposed to do this this is disrespectful this is Haram if your parents were in front of you would you have done this if your elders were there would you put your feet like this and they give a lot of examples and explanations with all due respect again we have to go to the Quran and to the Sunnah is there anything that states or indicates that it is not permissible not at all is there anything that insinuates that it is not recommended its disliked its makrooh none at all so what to do generally speaking if you're sleeping the Sunnah is to sleep on your right-hand side while facing the Qibla but if you don't do that and you decide to sleep with your feet towards the Qibla this is totally permissible because in order for me to say that this is disliked in this case I have to provide the evidence from the Quran the Sunnah stating that it is simply disrespectful or that you would not have done the same thing with your parents is not an evidence there are so many things I would not do in front of my parents which I would probably do elsewhere for example if I am going round the Kaabah the Sunnah is to leave the cabbage of my left not to face it so if my father is speaking to me and I give him my side it and I don't face him this is disrespectful you cannot have this analogy and put it together and claim that this is respectful this is disrespectful because the Sunnah tells us that it is prohibited to face or to give you back to the Qibla while answering the call of nature . it did not come in other forms to tell us that well you're not supposed to do so and so and so and so facing or giving you back to the table as well only in answering the call of nature whether you urinating or defecating it did not come to us and say well if you pass wind you must not be facing the Qibla or giving you back to it so if someone wanted to pass wind and then he redirects himself again this is an innovation because you're inventing something in Islam which is not part of it so people should expand the way they think and broader their way of deciding whether it is halal or Haram so that it fits like a glove with what the Quran and the Sunnah tell us instead of inventing things and coming up with things that are baseless and a large surgeon knows best"
