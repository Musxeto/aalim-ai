  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Canada Sheikh my question \nis regarding a Hadith the hadith goes, whoever   whoever is focused only on this world Allah \nwill make his affairs difficult make him feel   poverty and will not get anything of this world \nexcept that which was been decreed for him and   whoever is focused on the Hereafter \nAllah fix his Affairs for him make him   feel content make him feel pleased with \nhis situation and the worldly gains will   come to him even if he doesn't want it so \nmy question is uh how uh when like do we   focus on more on here after because we have \nto you know do our job and we get busy with   others so we we do pray first time then \nread Quran but is there enough to make uh so the Hadith is a well-known Hadith Dunya Hama um whoever this Dunya is all that preoccupies \nhim then Allah azzawajal would make all of   his Affairs scattered there's no \nBaraka in time and his poverty   was would be right in front of him all what he \nsee is lack of funds and poverty even if he's rich   but he doesn't see himself rich and he's always \ndepressed and nothing would come from this Dunya   to his sustenance except what Allah has \ndecreed nothing no favors no blessings   and the opposite is to the other person \nso the question of salahin is how   do we attain this high level of making the \nthe Hereafter or preoccupation something   that preoccupies our minds and lives okay this \nis very simple what do you prioritize in life   those who prioritize worldly Affairs over pleasing \nAllah how do I know Sheikh by skipping Salah   due to attending a football match or a meeting or \nto go out with the the boys or to play or to watch   a movie you have no problem in skipping \nus Allah yeah I can make it up later on   by favoring Haram over what pleases Allah so \nif there's a bribe wow man I'm gonna get rich   if someone asks me to cheat or to steal or to \nlie or to falsely testify no problem business   as usual I'm getting rich what is my focus \nto get this Dunya to collect as much as I can   this is the person that would go quickly down \nthe drain even if he's the richest man on earth   he's still unsatisfied he would never be \nsatisfied go to Bangladesh go to Pakistan   go to Somalia go to Yemen go to poor countries and \nlook at the Muslims they live below poverty line   and you say salaam alaikum how are things what \nwould they say alhamdulillah everything is before over what you don't have a car you don't have a \nhouse you live in a tent your kids are scattered   all over the country and you barely have food \nwhat are you praising Allah for Allah has given   me so much you're killing me man these guys care \nabout what Allah is pleased with not of this Dunya   this is why they're rich internally yes they don't \nhave a dime but they have satisfaction they have   content they go to bed with an easy mind and their \npillow is the most comfortable pillow on Earth   while the richest man on the world in the world   could not sleep without tranquilizers and and \ndowners or whatever they take before going to bed   this is the difference so there's nothing wrong \nand working to gain a good position or money   or studying hard to get a degree all of this is \ntotally legal and permissible where is your heart   I have to bend the rules a bit I have to cheat \nI have to lie in order to get things going Allah   is forgiving Allah is most merciful you've lost \nyour test but if I always do if I always walk the   talk and do what pleases Allah I'm in good hands \ninshallah and I hope this answers your question foreign"
