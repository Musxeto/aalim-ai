  "transcript": "Whether you did this or you did not do it, it happens. The Prophet ï·º after the miraculous night journey where he went to Jerusalem and then to the seventh heaven or he went to the seventh heaven then to Jerusalem and came back to Mecca in the same night, the idol worshippers challenged him to describe to them Bayt al-Maqdis, the mosque of Jerusalem. So he started describing it to them and then they asked him about things that he did not pay attention to. So he was a little bit depressed and saddened like he had never been because now it's the moment of truth and they're asking him so that they believe him or say that he's a liar. So Allah Azza Wa Jal and this hadith was reported in Sahih Muslim, Allah raised Bayt al-Maqdis for me to see and I started telling them exactly brick by brick whatever they had asked me about and Allah Azza Wa Jal made me truthful in front of them."
