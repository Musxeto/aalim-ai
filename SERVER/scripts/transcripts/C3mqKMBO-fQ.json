  "transcript": "Ammar is our first caller from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. May Allah grant you goodness Sheikh. And you as well my friend. What can I do for you? Sheikh, when I hear lectures or if I watch any Islamic videos, I take notes of the hadith or the quotes of the Sahabi or the words of the Salaf so that when I talk to people about Islam or give them advice, I have some evidence to what I'm saying so that people don't say that where is this hadith from so that I can give evidence. But recently I don't know if what I'm doing is right because I heard one of the Sheikhs say that if a person gains knowledge only for the purpose of talking to people and not for their own benefit, then this is prohibited because you are not doing this for your own growth, for your own Islam but to talk to people only. So I wanted your advice on this situation because I don't know if I should continue writing what I'm hearing. Ammar, Ammar, Ammar. Are you listening to these lectures in order to impress people? Yes or no? No, no. Are you listening to these lectures to be able to give khutbah or a presentation or to rule a gathering and be prominent? Yes or no? No. Then this, ignore this. This is from Shaytan. You're listening to the lecture to benefit, to learn, and you're writing down whatever benefit you have learned so that you can quote it. We all do this, Akhi. This is from Shaytan. Ignore it and don't listen to any of such whispers and keep on the good work you're doing inshaAllah."
