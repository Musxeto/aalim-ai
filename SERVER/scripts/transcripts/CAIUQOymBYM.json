  "title": "How long should a person stay in the masjid after salah? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question is about an observation he says how many minutes should a person stay in the Masjid after salat is it 10 15 minutes less or more is there anything prescribed the Sunnah encourages and highlights people to stay in the Masjid after congregational prayer whether to recite the Quran make vicar or just to sit and chill why because this is the house of Allah and the Prophet said alle sammen an authentic hadith whoever prays and remains in the place of his prayer meaning the Masjid as long as he does not nullify his Woodill then the angels supplicate to Allah saying o Allah forgive him oh allah have mercy upon him imagine if I stay there for another hour the angels are making dua for me who in his right mind would go and watch a football match or just go doing nothing this is a lot of reward by staying there so your friends who are staying there if they are staying waiting for the following salat this is like jihad as the Prophet had stated it's rabat sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and they are rewarded immensely so you should not look down upon them or think that they're wasting out their time on the contrary they are utilizing and investing their time in the best of fashion"
