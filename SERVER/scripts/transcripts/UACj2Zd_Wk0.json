  "transcript": "foreign [Music] says can animals hear the screams from the dead when they are being punished in the grave we know that individuals are either tormented in their graves or blessed by Allah as for the animals hearing the torment and the punishment I personally don't know of any evidence supporting it the only incident we know of is that when a sinful person or a disbeliever is placed in his grave and his soul is taken to the first heaven not being admitted and then thrown back to Earth he is met with an angel and he's questioned by the two angels and then he's beaten on his head with a hammer or a sledge like that if a mountain were to be struck by it it would turn into dust and he turns into a into dust then he's turned back again to his original form and he's struck by it again and he shouts a loud scream that everyone hears other than the humans in the Jinn which means including the animals they hear this and this is certain and an authentic Hadith what happens afterwards is he punished or while he's punished and tormented can they hear this we don't have any evidence to back it up and Allah Knows Best um [Music] foreign have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign foreign"
