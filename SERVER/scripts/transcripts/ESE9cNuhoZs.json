  "title": "Can I read Surah Mulk in prayer or only recite as the night athkaar, what about Surah Kahf?",
  "transcript": "Abdurrahman from the US. My question for today is like you know how reading Tabarak and Surahs such as Tabarak and Surah Al-Kahf from week to week and reading Tabarak every day protects you from the grave. Is it permissible to like cut it up and read it in Salah as well or do you have to read it like only out of Salah only? It is permissible to read it every night if you read it in Salat. Inshallah this is applicable as well but the best is to read it part of your bedtime Adhkar. When you are at bed you recite this, you recite Surah Al-Sajdah as the Prophet used to do alayhis salatu wasalam and you recite the rest of the Adhkar. This is best inshallah."
