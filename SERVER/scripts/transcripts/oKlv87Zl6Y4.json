  "transcript": "Ahmed from Morocco Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh my question is regarding legislation someone who sets rules in his house or offices that goes against Sharia such as a company owner sets rules that women are not allowed to wear hijab or anyone working in his office must free mix otherwise they would be fired now if he sets those rules to desire to sin even though that's sinful but is that legislating other than Allah there are three verses in chapter 5 Surah Al-Ma'idah verse number 45 verse number 44 45 and 47 three verses 44 45 and 47 one says whoever does not legislate with what Allah Azza Wa Jal has revealed then these are the disbelievers the other verse in 45 is almost identical but with the different ending and adjective and description and whoever does not legislate with what Allah has revealed these are the wrongdoers and 47 says and whoever does not legislate with what Allah has revealed these are the sinners so this shows you that legislating other than what Allah has revealed in his Sharia can be kufr and it can be a form of transgression and dhulm and wrongdoing and can be sinful depending on the intention so if a person legislates something that goes clearly against the Sharia banning hijab though he knows that this is the ruling of Allah yet he says that no my ruling is equivalent to the ruling of Allah or even better this is kufr if he's doing it due to money wise I know it's haram but I'm doing it just to gain some favors with the rulers or to make money on the side this is dhulm this is wrongdoing and it's one of the worst major sins possible and if someone does it because he's ignorant he doesn't know yet he still made that legislation with his ignorance where he shouldn't be in that place in the first place then that is sinful and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best you"
