  "title": "Does Allah Give Permission for Evil? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "did from bangladesh i heard in a youtube video that says without the last permission nothing happens without allah's permission nothing happens this is a lie against allah that means you're trying to say that the crime is happening in this world is happening with the permission of allah but allah never told you to do that brother he told you to do good and forbid they will so i wanna know what is the correct view so when the crime took place was it with allah permission or against allah's permission meaning allah could not stop it i'm waiting for your answers indeed now i need to say that i heard any youtube videos okay i will answer you i will answer inshaallah zadeed says the issue of allah's permission preordainment is one of the six pillars of iman and it's a long topic we spoke about it so many times i have so many videos about it it has two types of divine will allah has two types of will legislative and these are referring to the things that allah loves allah loves people to pray and he does not love them not to pray but there are people who do not pray so this happened without allah's permission the legislative permission and the second type of preordainment is or destiny is the universal which happens whether allah loves it or not it's going to happen because it's according to his wisdom and knowledge so allah azzawajal loves people to accept islam those who did not accept islam went against allah's legislative will but they went according to allah's universal will because allah predestined it upon them that they will not believe and they will go to hell and they will commit crimes so these are two divine wills that you have to understand but the time is not sufficient everything happens with with allah's will"
