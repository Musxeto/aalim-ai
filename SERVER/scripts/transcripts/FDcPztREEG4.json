  "transcript": "uh go one question there's one book i think is from the ushers they say that uh some of the olya have access to the local mafu what's the right now some of the audi have access to the what laughs yes yes where did they get this from i don't know okay i will answer inshallah adil from the uk he says we have people saying that some awliya awliya are saints they have knowledge of the preserved tablet and i have six phds and i speak five dead languages and two living languages it's a claim do you believe any schmuck that comes to you and says that i have this and i have that walk on water if you can or fly in the air if you can these are blatant liars and most likely they're marketed they're endorsed by grave worshippers so when you see someone who claims to be a muslim and going to the grave and worshiping the grave and asking mawlana al-jilani tijani badawi shadily whatever their names are and say oh protect me from evil or bring to me something or pay off my debt what are you doing this is shirk he said no no no no i've heard someone say that it's not shirk okay even if you heard that it is not sure what are you doing they're dead said yes but they have knowledge of the preserved tablet so masha allah as far as we know muslims we read the quran we read the sunnah and we know that no one knows what's in the preserved tablet except allah not even the angels so how do you dare say such a thing do you have any proof said no no but scholars say these are not scholars these are all uh um soothsayers or imposters milking you for money and you're paying so why wouldn't why would they stop"
