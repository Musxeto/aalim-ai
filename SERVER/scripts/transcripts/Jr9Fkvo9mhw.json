  "transcript": "Yousef from the UK uh if I go on YouTube and search a video of a Muslim and I watch something of him that he doesn't have any kufur in it. However, the channel has videos where he does kufur in it. And in the video that there is maybe nothing haram, no kufur in it. He says sub don't forget to like and subscribe. I and I want to watch this video because it has things. Okay. But then the channel he has some things that he says out of maybe it's out of ignorance or actions themselves. So um what what to do? Do not subscribe and do not like but you may benefit from whatever is beneficial that has no kufur or sin in it because no one is perfect. There are so many disbelievers and caffers out there even professors teachers. So would we refrain from learning from them what is beneficial for us just because they have other issues? No. We take whatever is beneficial from them and leave whatever is haram and not endorse that."
