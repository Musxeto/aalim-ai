  "transcript": "muhammad from pakistan uh i asked you a question yesterday about the about a loan from my parents which i took uh you said that it was uh totally prohibited to give them uh any money in return of that loan so my question is that i have given them uh quite a lot of money uh for about uh quite some time and they won't be able to return me that money because they don't have that much income and if they are going to uh if they are if they plan to return with them to sell their jewelry and their car so what to do in this uh instance and the second and the disclaimer of this question is that uh when we when i took the loan i asked a mufti uh here in pakistan and he said that uh he actually gave us a green check yeah that you can uh take the loan and give your parents uh some money so uh but there was some uh feeling uh gut feeling in me and my parents that this might be a bit uh wrong or something like that and that's why i asked you a question but uh are we sinful and uh the niya was that you know we were doing the right thing but there was a good feeling i will answer it says a long story his parents gave him money that they invested and he borrowed it and started giving them interest on it not fixed but according to the profit they used to make from the investment i told him that this is river this is not permissible with conditions and that is that they know that you'll give them an an interest and this is something that you both agreed upon but if it is not agreed upon and they just lent you money and you're giving it as a gift from your own self this is no problem i said this yesterday now he's elaborating and saying that there is a mufti who told them that this is okay well if this is the case you should stop immediately consider whatever was in the past as a gift and the sins that accumulated would all be re-credited to this mufti who told you that this is a halal the mufti's way of thinking is that they're your parents so there is no transgression when you give them interest over alone like when a stranger gives interest over a loan to someone else so he says that this is all kosher and it's legit because this it falls under the category of gifts and their parents this is totally wrong but the sin is on the one who gave you your fatwa so forget about the previous uh interest that you had given he will take care of it inshallah on the day of judgment as from now you should stop this altogether"
