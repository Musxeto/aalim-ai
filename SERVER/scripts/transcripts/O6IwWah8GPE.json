  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So if a woman is asking a message and she knows that she is going to be clean on a particular day, but this day she checks Al-Asr and she's not clean, but she knows it's almost likely sure that she will be clean before Al-Isha. But she wants to go out and she cannot do Wudhu when she goes out. What does she have to do or she has to stay home? No, she doesn't have to stay home because the default is that she's still in her menses. But if she goes out before Maghreb and she's not pure and after Maghreb she's out and she goes to the toilet and she checks and she finds out that she has become pure, but there are no facilities for her to perform Ghusl. In this case, Alhamdulillah, she can combine between Maghreb and Isha when she goes back home and performs Ghusl and pray Maghreb and Isha combined and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
