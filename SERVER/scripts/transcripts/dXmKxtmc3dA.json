  "title": "If 2 men are praying & a 3rd joins them, does the imam take a step forward to lead? | AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "a smile says two men form congregation and are already praying a third person joins them should the Imam take a couple of steps forward to lead them or does he stay in the same place and everyone stands side by side in the same row and what if a woman joins them when the two men are praying first of all when two men are praying in congregation they must stand side by side it is a misconception that the Imam should be a little bit forward from the person standing right to him they should stand in the same role when a third person joins in we have one of two options either the Imam steps forward or and this is the norm that the follower to his right is tapped on the shoulder and he steps backwards so they form a row behind the Imam this is the norm and this is what is usually done so either way is okay but for two of them to stand by his side this is against the Sunnah and this is not the right thing to do his second question is about if a woman joins them so if two men are praying together and a woman comes in and she wants to join them she simply stands behind them both and joins the prayer"
