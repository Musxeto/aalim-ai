  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh so my question \nis is it permissible to make a website for   a Halal business that uses cryptocurrencies uh \nto receive payments from their users alongside   the PayPal and credit card I believe as many \nscholars have stated that crypto currencies   and these digital currencies are still \nHaram to be used and circulated and we have   seen last month the Abduction of one of their \nMongols who embezzled a lot in in the billions   through his company dealing with one of these uh \ncurrencies and it is still unstable unauthentic   unreal so for you as a Muslim you must \nnot deal with such currencies until it is   authenticated and approved by the central \nbanks of the majority of countries only   then we can look into it and see if it can \nbe permitted or not and Allah Knows Best"
