  "transcript": "Abdul Kabir from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh, I had a question. I went to the store and I bought all my groceries and I bought some apples. And then when I left the store and I came home, I realized that they did not charge me for these apples. And so I tried to call the store and see, and they said that we recommend that I call the manager. But then I don't know, do I have to go back and pay for these or is it the employee's fault for not scanning? It is 1000% obligatory upon you to go and pay them for what they did not scan. It is not an issue of, I fooled them, I pulled a prank on them, I managed to cheat them. No, Allah will record this and will hold you accountable on the Day of Judgment. For example, I went to a store and I said, how much is this product which is 64 megabyte or gigabyte or whatever, gigabyte maybe. And he says, XY Euros. So we agreed and he wrote it's 64 gigabyte, this model, this specifications and the price is XYZ. And I took it home. When I opened the product, I found that it was 128. So it's double the capacity or the memory size or whatever. Just wow, man, I made a fortune. I hit a winning strike or whatever. Why? I paid half the amount of what I should have paid for 128. Yeah, but this is haram money. Well, it's his mistake. No, it's not his mistake. If he made a mistake, now you're cheating and stealing. Go back to the shop and pay the difference or give it back and take what you originally paid for, the one with the 64 gigabyte. So I hope this clarifies the issue. It's not a matter of it's something came from me from the heavens. No, this is cheating and lying. You have to go and pay for it. You cannot avail such a service or such a gift that was not given to you lawfully. And Allah knows best."
