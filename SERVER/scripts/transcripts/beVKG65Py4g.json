  "transcript": "thirdly what to do when I want to make croupier because some people say do I put my hand over the head of the person I'd like to make rupiah for or do I just recite the Koran what was the procedure again we have to go back to the Quran and the Sunnah and mainly to the Sunnah the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam has narrated by mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her whenever he used to go to bed he used to blow and then recite the last three holes of the Quran and then wipe whatever he can from his body but if he felt pain in his body now this is the night coat and coat rupiah or bed at car but the actual rakia whenever he felt pain in his body he used to recite the three apples then blow not the opposite and then he wipes over it when he was sick at the end of his life mother Aisha said I used to gather his own hands read in them the three holes blow and wipe his body with his own hands which means that mmm no he says the actual blowing is part of the rakia so whether you blow on your grandmother by reciting al-fatiha a little curtsy the last two ayahs of surah al-baqarah and the last he pulls and you dry blow on her or you do that on your hand and wipe on her this is hala this is okay there is no problem in that insha Allah but you have to be present I've heard of some Iraqis who are performing rakia long distance and that's my fine to me he's in the states and the people are in India and he goes alhamdulillah me and he blows in his head phone or his handset and sometimes they go into conference call so UK Korea and India in the same call what is this this doesn't work this is totally bogus and it does not work"
