  "transcript": "my mother bought two wind chimes just for decoration and I found it later than that it is Haram to hang them because people used to hang them with a superstitious belief now am I obliged to tell my mother that it's Haram she will make fun of me what to do now this is an issue of controversy basically speaking wind chimes are fine these are fine beautiful decorations that when the wind blows it gives a soothing sound isn't it music share no it's not music it's not fixed tunes that one can dance to or be uh entertained by it's just random sounds however if you are in a country or if you're among people who believe that this has an impact on kicking out evil spirits or bringing luck or any superstitious belief in this case we have to take it down likewise wearing this blue eye lots of the people who visit the Middle East when they go to Egypt or to Morocco they buy this beautiful necklace that has a blue eye or a ring or an earring everyone in the Middle East knows that this is worn by people as a tawis as an amulet to keep the evil eye away from you other people may have never heard of this before so they do it because it looks nice it looks beautiful so for this reason we tell people you're not allowed to wear it they say that my intention is fine I know your intention is fine but do to what other people may think we have to avoid it the origin of this is mentioned in Muslim when a companion came to the prophet Allah and he said o prophet of Allah I vowed to slaughter a camel in the village of buwana Village of buwana is a few miles away from Medina it's like somewhere between Medina so the prophet asked him two questions number one is in buwana that Village is there an idol that people worship because then people will think that you're slaughtering for the idol the man said no second question the prophet said Allah is there a festival for the disbelievers meaning do they come at a particular time where they feast and offer sacrifices or they have a celebration and the man said no then the prophet said Allah fulfill your vow go ahead you have the green light this means that whenever there's controversy or ambiguity or people may think that you're resembling them and imitating them in their false superstitious beliefs you have to refrain from that and Allah azzawajal knows best if your mom thinks yeah and it ridicules you or makes fun of you you've done your due diligence in front of Allah and and that's sufficient"
