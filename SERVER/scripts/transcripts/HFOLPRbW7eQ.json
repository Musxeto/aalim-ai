  "title": "ðŸ†• Should I privately message sisters who make videos without hijab to advise? Assim al hakeem JAL ï¿¼",
  "transcript": "Asna from India. Sheikh I started an Instagram account to watch Islamic videos but I come up with videos of sisters who are Muslims not wearing hijab in a proper way. Sheikh my question is should I advise them respectfully by not being a haram police by messaging them privately or through comment box or just stay quiet? Jazak Allah. Wa Jazakum. The the rule of thumb is that we Muslims should advise one another and we should be allies to one another. So if someone sees something bad being done by me they should give me advice and if I see someone doing something bad I should give them an advice. If I'm having a counseling session and I see the brother in the counseling session with me having a haircut that is inappropriate I should give him an advice and tell him Akhi this is haram you shouldn't be doing this and I apologize for interfering in your affairs but I have to take it off my chest so that you don't come on the day of judgment and hold me accountable. So yes if you can send them a private message with a diplomacy and respect you're rewarded for that but you should not expect them to show their appreciation or gratitude because lots of the people may be offended of that and rarely you will find people who would send you a thank you note. So do it for the sake of Allah whenever you can and anticipate the reward only from Allah."
