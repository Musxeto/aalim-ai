  "transcript": "so I have two questions the first one under what circumstances is it allowed to back bite the second question is it allowed to lie in order to hide a good de for example just an example if someone reads seven a day the Quran and ask how many how muchan you he say is that first of all please ask one question because there are so many people and I hate people when they say she I have two questions and they are cascaded into two or three lectures I I cannot afford this um so because he's volunteering and he has Wasa we will inshallah move on so question number one when is backbiting permissible generally speaking speaking it is not but there are Necessities that may allow you to do something that would be considered as backbiting so for example if you can avoid and do it you must someone comes to me and says so and so is proposing to my sister what do you think I know this person is a drug drug addict I know he is involved in domestic violence and abuse I know that he doesn't pray so instead of backbiting him I have to take stage one what is stage one I say listen do you believe my judgment and trust me of course your she you're our she definitely don't go through this man marriage this man is not good full stop did I back bite no I didn't if he trusts me and bu buys it alhamdulillah if he doesn't say no no she I have to know because this is an important issue and my sister is in love with this man in this case I have to put my cards on the table he does this he does this and this is not backbiting fa may Allah be pleased with her came to the prophet and said I have two proposals mua ab sufyan and Abu Jah may Allah be pleased with them they proposed to me so what do you think what did the prophet sayam he said as for mua his Stone broke doesn't have money yeah he will live a difficult life as for Abu jaham he's a man who holds his staff his stick on his shoulder which means one of two either that he beats women which is not most likely or that he puts his staff on his shoulder to hang his sack of clothes he travels a lot he's a frequent flyer so he won't be home most of the time however I would advise you to marry Usama in Z and she married him and she was happy with him so this is a redirection someone comes to you say says Sheikh I'm a businessman and brother so and so wants to go into partnership with me and already previously two years back three people came to me complaining that they went into partnership with the brother and he stole their money what should I say take my advice don't he said no I need more details I said okay this is what happened this is not backbiting this is clarifying you know that so and so goes to Sheikh so so and so but you know that the Sheikh is a super Sufi he's the one who when he makes Vick he goes and Swirls and round and round and round mallah like a a fan or he sits after F and he says Allah Allah Allah my old GMC car was like this in 1994 when you started now the new GMC cars they have Mufflers it doesn't make this VI anyhow so I said this guy is of inov ation he makes he doesn't follow the prophet you cannot go to him and so on and on and on so I hope this answers your first question"
