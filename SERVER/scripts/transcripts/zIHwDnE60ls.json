  "transcript": "because it is uh looking for them in some ways uh so can you just uh explain this a little bit because uh uh to my you know like uh not not my you know false flawed understanding i'm not uh so the prophet said every son of adam has been prescribed his share of zidane so the eyes commit zina and their zina is looking meaning not lowering your gaze and the ears commit zina and their zina is listening and the hands commit zina and their zina is touching and the feet commit zira and their zina is walking and the private part either falsifies this or approves this meaning that these parts of zina or fornication through the eyes and hearing and touching and walking they're considered to be minor yes they're sinful but they're minor you don't flog someone for committing them you don't stone a married person for doing them he's sinful he'll be punished for that but not the prescribed punishment the prescribed punishment takes place only when penetration occurs and this is what's referring to the last part of the hadith and the private part a either falsifies this or confirms it meaning by doing the act of fornication or adultery may allah protect us you"
