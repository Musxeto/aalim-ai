  "transcript": "uh the next question is uh from a sister i want to ask if a wife is obliged to fulfill her duties towards her husband when he doesn't even care does not pray and even drinks also if it is sin upon her if she denies to sleep with him when he is drunk this is a compound question and usually sisters post such questions when they are in an unstable state of mind due to their anger with their husband frustration uh disappointment so many sisters come and say sheriff my husband doesn't pray should i stay with him or divorce him and i say um okay how long you've been with your husband oh 35 years ship and he hasn't been praying for 35 years yes sir so why are you coming now i'm fed up of this life ah so it's not the prayer you're interested in it's the easy exit from such a relationship no this is not the right thing to do we can't give you fatwa tailored to your question without looking into the background so the great question is sheikh my husband drinks and he doesn't pray but to tell you the truth he prays on and off so he prays jummah sometimes he prays at work oh so he does not totally abandon prayer he is a a worshiper yeah but it's not really tight so basically speaking i started to hate him and i don't want to fulfill his rights in bed would i be sinful and cursed by the angels every single night or not ah then this is a different angle to look at into therefore such questions cannot be answered directly i don't know the background of such a marriage i don't know the background of such a husband maybe if we ask the husband he would say i pray but i only miss the fajr i go to bed late and i'm wrong it's my mistake and i can't walk wake up until it's seven o'clock and the sun is already in the sky so it's my mistake yes i i acknowledge do i drink yeah i drink sometimes do i do drugs sometimes but i fulfill my duties to my wife i support her i provide 400 children i'm a good father everybody knows me as a good person but she has a problem i don't know if she has a relationship with an ex-boyfriend or a cousin she wants to get married to all of a sudden she started changing oh so we have to speak to the husband we have to speak to the wife counseling is not you venting to me my husband does this and that and i said oh the son of a gun he has to stand in front a fighting squad because from experience when i listen to him complaining about you i say that you should be hanged so when you both sit together after listening from to both of you i find that 50 of what he says is not being repeated in front of you and 50 of what you said against him is not repeating in front of him and then we can find a way to reconcile so in a nutshell if a husband drinks or does drugs but he is still a muslim if you do not have intimacy with him would that improve his religious commitment or he would go to prostitutes to look for fulfilling his desire which is natural and he has halal sources to practice it with but it's you who's refusing you have to look at the pros and the cons and the end result of your actions and that would answer you in sha allah you"
