  "transcript": "what's the penalty for accidental death in islam what is the what if the guilty person is poor there are a number of things that would classify a death to be accidental so any type of killing that happens without the intent of harming the other because we have deliberate murder we have me deliberate and we have accidental without going into details accidental is when you kill someone without any intention to harm him so if you're shooting a bird and not knowing that behind that bird is a person and you happen to kill that person there's no intention of harming him unlike when i hit someone with a baseball bat wanting to hurt him but not kill him and he dies this is semi accident semi deliberate murder so in accidental things that are accidental not intentional without the intention of hurting someone if such a death takes place i'm driving someone has an accident i kill someone by mistake this is accidental i have to give the blood money to the deceased family or the heir of the deceased and this is estimated of the value of a hundred camels so we check in the market and see how much a hundred camels cost and we have to give it as blood money to the heirs of the deceased this money comes from my family my tribe my people as form of cooperation so they're cooperating because this happened by accident it's not my intention it's not my fault so they would help me and support me by donating as much as they can to pay off their blood money secondly i have to because i did the killing i was the one involved i have to free a slave a believing muslim slave and this is not possible nowadays so we go to stage two which is fasting two consecutive months so that allah would accept my repentance and i would feel good killing someone is not an easy thing so even if you do it by mistake you'll you'll always feel guilty though it's not your fault but you will feel guilty and hence allah has made this form of expiation to fast two consecutive months so that you would receive the tranquility and the peace of mind by offering this if a person is poor well this is the right of the deceased heirs you have to pay them whether you get this from zakat whether you beg people for money in order to clear your debt towards them"
