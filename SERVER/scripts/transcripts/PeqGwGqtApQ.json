  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] I can Allah. Alhamdulillah. Dear brothers and sisters in Islam, and welcome to this new episode that deals with how to keep our hearts alive and close to Allahawel. The prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned in a number of a hadith different narrations all revolving around the same topic. Abu Hur tells us that the prophet saidatam the heart of an old man remains young in two things love of life and love of wealth. In another narration he saidatam the heart of an elderly person remains youthful in two things love of this world and long hopes. And yet in another narration he said as a person grows older and his body weakens his heart remains young in love of two things long life and wealth. We find that and there are many narrations other than that but we don't have enough time. We find that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam highlighted that everything becomes old in our bodies. Yet the heart remains young and strong. pumps like crazy for two reasons. Because it loves this dunya, this life and it has long hope. Now scholars interpreted this hadith and explained it in so many beautiful words. May Allah have mercy on his soul. Says that because an elderly person is growing old and weak, yet his heart continues to be young in the love of this dunya and in the love of living longer and longer. So no matter how old he gets physically, his heart yearns to live longer and gain more. Imobi says in this hadith, it highlights that it is abhored and disliked in Islam to live long or to love to live long and to gain and hoard money. Alhamdular wrote in his book that the reason the prophet chose these two things loving long life and having this love for this dunya is that the most valuable thing to a person's self is his own life. So he wants to preserve it. He wants to maintain it. And that is why he loves to live longer and longer. And he loves money. He loves this dunya. He loves wealth because it is one of the greatest means of continuous health which usually would result in prolonging your life. And this is why the more people have money, the more longer they live because they can afford good doctors, good hospitals and the lifespan expectancy would grow longer and longer. It is also said that he remains young not that his heart is actually young rather because these two characteristics are more befitting of young people to love this dunya to love gaining more wealth so that they could enjoy it more and more. So the love of this dunya is a representation of the love of wealth. What is it that we love in this dunya? Is it the concrete buildings? Is it the steel vehicles? No, it is what we can enjoy of it. And the love of long life and having long hopes is to live forever if we can. The love of duny is the worst thing that may corrupt the heart and we don't pay attention to that. Unfortunately, we see that when someone says, \"I don't love this dunya. I don't need to share with you the glamours of this life. I don't enjoy what you guys are striving to collect and boast about. They look at you. They actually look down at you and say that there's something wrong with you. You're not natural. Not knowing that the love of this duny is one of the worst corruptors of the heart. Because when you love this dunya, you become enslaved to it, to its adornment, to its beauty. And that would make you give it precedent to Allah's love. The prophet saysam, \"Perish the slave of the dinar and the slave of the dirham and the slave of fine clothing. If he's given, he's pleased and if he is not given, he's angry.\" This is a description that fits like a glove to the vast majority of Muslims nowadays. When they're given money, when they're given dunya, they're pleased. Oh, Allah loves me. Oh, allahel has a very good place for me in Jenna. But if he's not given the dunya, if he's tested, if he's tried, then he's angry. Why is Allah doing this to me? I remember visiting one uncle. He was in his 70s. He was a good man. May Allah have mercy on his soul. And he was sick. So I said, \"Uncle, may Allah make this purification of your sins and may Allah raise your level in Jenna with your patience.\" He says, \"My son, I'm not angry with what is happening to me. What angers me the most is I've been praying in this masjid for 50 years, never missed a salat. While my neighbor of 50 years had never offered one single salat in it. Yet look at him. He's as healthy as a bull. And look at me, sick and tired and in pain and agony. I said, \"Uncle, subhan Allah, what are you doing? You've almost lost all of your good deeds because of objecting and complaining about Allah's test to you. This life is nothing. So comments on this hadith of the slave of the dirham and the dinar. He says those who love this dunya they're always accompanied by three things. Constant sorrow, continuous tiredness and anxiety that never ends. This is because whoever loves this duny cannot get what he wants. Every one of us love the dunya. We want this, we want this, we want this, we want everything. What do we get of it? A small portion that Allah has decreed for us. So, we're always in sorrow, in tiredness, in anxiety because we're unable to get what we want. And whatever we get, we want a step further because we're never satisfied. As for long hopes, this is something that we can see in our lives. Every one of us wants to live as long as they can. Rarely and seldomly you will hear someone saying that I've lived a good life. Alhamdulillah, I'm ready to meet Allah subhana wa tala. Everyone says no. Uh a little bit more. If you visit a 90 years old geyser as they say and he's barely able to speak or walk or talk and he's lost most of his teeth and you say, \"Uncle, how much do you think you're going to live?\" He says, \"Well, I've heard of a prophet of Allah who lived for 950 years. So few years more won't hurt. What do you want? Every single person on earth is inevitably going to die. What are you hoping for? This is a dilemma. Everybody says, \"May Allah give you long life and good health.\" Amy, but then what? when the angel of death came to Musa peace be upon him and he told him that Allah tells you put your hand on the skin of a bull and with each strain of hair you have one year to live imagine how much hair would my hand cover maybe 5,000 so MS said then what let's assume Assume that I get 5,000 years extra. Then what? The angel of death said, \"Then death.\" You have to die. Musha said, \"In this case, now I'd not rather wait another 5,000 years. Let it be now. I'm going to die. I'm going to die.\" This is how we roll. As they say, Muslims, righteous, practicing, knowledgeable Muslims, they remember a saying. Some say it's a hadith, but it's not a hadith. It's a saying of wisdom. Live as if you're never going to die and work for your hereafter as you're going to die tomorrow. live and do things for this world, for your life as if you're never going to die. So, plan to build a house. Plan to invest your money. Plan to teach your children to be well educated and good elements of this community and society as if you're never going to die. Work hard to have a good body and a healthy life as if you're never going to die. But when you look at the hereafter, when you offer forms of worship, when you think of halal and haram, always remember that you may die today. And that would make you have a short hope in life. And this is what makes you productive. says, \"The key to preparing for the hereafter is having short hopes.\" The key for all goodness is to wish in what Allah has and to wi to hope for the hereafter. And the key for every evil is the love of this dunya and long hopes. And the love of this dunya is the mother of all sins. It corrupts the religion. It tarnishes your heart and hardens it and makes it tough and rough. Because when you love this dunya, this means that you will glorify it and you will look at it as one of the greatest things in life. While actually it is looked down upon at the side of Allah and it is one of the greatest sins to glorify what Allah has put down. Besides, allahel has cursed the dunya. Allah abhors the dunya except what gets people closer to him in it. And whoever loves what Allah curses and abhors, then Allah would curse him and abhorse him. And he is exposing himself to trials and tribulations. Besides, when someone loves the dunya, it becomes his objective and he would do everything in his possession to reach it instead of reaching Allah and the hereafter. So he reversed what things should be done or how things should be done and that's why his heart is upside down and reversed. Look at this hadith. The prophet saidat wasam every nation has a trial has a fitna and the trial of my ummah is wealth. How much are you willing to do for money? How many scholars have sold their religion for a fist of few dollars? How many of them have compromised the dean to get a position, an authority or to get mansions and wealth and millions and cars? Subhan Allah. This is their trial. And how many are still steadfast, not compromising the dean, not accepting to be bought. Millionaires and billionaires come and say everybody has a price. You too, she have a price. No, this is not true. Those who take off their eyes of the ball, those who take their eyes off the ball will lose. Real Muslims, practicing, god-fearing Muslims always keep their eyes on the ball. They want Jenna. They don't care about your money. They don't care about how fancy life is. Yes, everybody enjoys a good meal. Everybody enjoys a good ride. Everybody enjoys to have money. But when it has a price and this price is hellfire, every sound intellectual individual would keep his distance as far as he can. Therefore, an advice to myself and to you, be careful of this dunya. So beautiful, so glamorous. No matter what you do, Shayan is always waiting for you to corrupt your heart, to darken it, to tarnish it. And the more you allow him to enter your heart and dwell in it and do whatever he wants, the more you are suffering. Everyone on earth is bound to die. It was reported that may Allah be pleased with him with his father was giving once and he was reflecting upon life and reminding the congregation about life and he said prophet Muhammadat wasallam died when he was 63. Abu Bakr died when he was 63. Omar died when he was 63 and I am 63 years of age. And he started to weep and cry. Meaning what am I waiting for? If these wonderful people died when they were 63, this means that I am in overtime. Allah is giving me time. So this advice is not directed to those who are as old as I am. This is directed to the youngsters. Never allow the the dunya and the love of wealth to be in your heart because it will kill it. Always have the dunya in your hand. If there is a need, give it away to those who are in need. It won't harm you. But if it's in your heart and you try to give some of it to someone else, it will kill you. Always remember that you are a dead person walking on earth. You're just waiting for your time to come. So do whatever you can to fill up your grave with good deeds because you're going to die. Only Allah knows when. But when you die, you want to see your grave filled with good deeds. You want your legacy to remain after you. People remember you. People say, \"May Allah have mercy on him. May Allah forgive him. May Allah fill fills May Allah fill his grave with good deeds and favors and blessings from Jenna from paradise. Unlike those who've spent their lives entertaining people in haram and people after their death continue to say their songs, to remember their movies, to remember the bad things and evil things they've done as part of art and it's filling their heart their graves continuously with may Allahel protect us. Allah knows what. So as a young man and as a young woman, work hard on keeping your eyes on the ball. Your target is Jenna. This life has peaks and valleys, ups and downs. One day you're rich and one day you're poor, begging people for money and help. One day you're healthy and one day you are bedridden. People serve you and clean you and do your needs. Life does not remain in a constant line. It has ups and downs. Be the one who does not change, who does not have anxiety and panic attacks when it changes and goes down. Be always connected to allahel knowing that whatever Allah gives is his favor and blessing and whatever Allah prevents that is with his wisdom and knowledge and I'm content with whatever comes to me. We have a short break. Stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back."
