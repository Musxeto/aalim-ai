  "transcript": "Faheem from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Salam. Sheikh, due to the different different opinions on the internet, many of us often cannot spot the difference between Masjid Al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock. The most widespread picture which has a vibrant gold-colored dome is this Masjid Al-Aqsa. JazakAllah. Wa Jazak. I have not had the pleasure and the honor to go there, but through what I have learned, no, the Masjid of the Dome is not Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa. It is something next to it. May Allah liberate it from the oppressors and from our enemies, the Jews, and may Allah Azza Wa Jal grant us two accepted rak'ahs in it when it's free and liberated. you"
