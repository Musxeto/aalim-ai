  "transcript": "Fahmida from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Is it considered cheating if someone goes to another country with a lower currency to pay for Umrah or Hajj? JazakAllah Khair. I did not get your question. Is it considered cheating or is it permissible for someone to go to a country with a lower currency to go for Umrah or Hajj? No, this is not cheating. If you come for Umrah or Hajj from the U.S., the rate is extremely high, but if you go to Pakistan, you'll probably pay half the price there. So lots of the U.S. citizens go to Pakistan and book their Hajj packages or Umrah packages from Pakistan or from India or from their second country, and they come and there's no problem in that. There's no cheating at all. Thank you."
