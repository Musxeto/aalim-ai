  "transcript": "Ziad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh, one day I was late for Asr prayer in the congregation and we formed a second congregation but what happened is at the last Raka'ah I actually kind of forgot that how many prostrations I did but when I rose up from Sujood and I heard some people reading the Attahiyat and thought if I were to do one and I raise my fingers like the Sunnah they would correct me and I continued praying and I finished the prayer and nobody said anything so was that the right thing to do or should I have prostrated one more? You were praying in congregation? You were praying with the congregation? I was leading the prayer and nobody said Subhanallah to correct you? No So you acted upon the feeling that you had not done any mistake and hence you should have done prostration of forgetfulness after the Sujood if you had real doubt whether you did one or two and you acted upon the certainty of people not correcting you so this doubt should have been rectified by Sujood As-Sahw just because you did not know what to do again and you did not offer it your prayer is valid Inshallah"
