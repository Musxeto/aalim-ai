  "transcript": "Muneeb from USA. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Yes, I commute to a college that's 85 kilometers away two times a week and I have classes all day and I break my fast with water and when I reach home it's almost Isha time so definitely it's a bit difficult but I do want to fast if I fast on those days is my fasting valid? Without any doubt the fasting of a traveler is valid even if he's traveling 500 kilometers. If he insists on fasting, the fast is valid. Not only that, it is highly recommended for him to fast if there's no hardship. Someone who's traveling a thousand kilometers by air, this would probably be an hour and a half by airplane and there's no hardship at all on him. Do we say, oh it's recommended that you break your fasting? No. We'd say it's recommended that you maintain and observe your fasting because fasting in the month of Ramadan when everybody else is fasting is far better and greater than fasting when no one is fasting and the hardship is greater when you're doing it alone and Allah knows best. you"
