  "transcript": "The second question is about E-Codes. What is \nthe ruling on using foods that contain pork,   derived substances, and how to deal \nwith them? E-Codes, for example.   Well, it is a rule of thumb that anything that \ncontains harām ingredients is harām by itself. And   nowadays with modern production of food, canned \nfood, and the likes, we have a vast array of   products that are either ambiguous or confusing. \nAnd we spend a lot of time on the shelves in   supermarkets reading the ingredients and what does \nit contain. And this may cause a lot of hardship,   however, it is best for a human being to be \nsafe rather to be sorry. So if you live in a   Muslim country like Saudi Arabia, like Kuwait for \nexample, and you know that the authorities there   go out of the way to ensure that everything \nthat comes through their borders is halāl.   I, personally, when I shop, I don't look at \nthe ingredients because I'm confident that   it is halāl. I buy anything and I eat anything. \nIt's all legit, with the grace of Allah. If I   were to go to Europe, or to the to the U.S, then \nI would be hesitant to buy things I don't know   and hence I would read the ingredients. \nNow, most of these products have E-Codes   on them - E 250, 735 etc. I don't know what these \ncodes are all about. When you look into them, some   straightforward say it's harām. Why? Because \nit contains ingredients that have pork fat,   or pork meat, or harām meat in it. If it \nwere vegetarian it's kosher. It's halāl. If   it were derived from sea creatures then it's \ntotally halāl. The ambiguity comes whether   it is from halāl meat such as cows and and sheep, \nwhether they were slaughtered Islamically or not,   or whether it's from harām meat such as dogs and \ndead horses and maybe pork. So what is the ruling?   There are two opinions; one says that it's harām \nuntil proven otherwise. And the other is halāl   until proven otherwise. And the E-Codes \nusually refers to glycerin or whatever is   related to it such as gelatin. And these products, \na lot of the scientists say, that they undergo a   vigorous and rigorous - (if this is even a word) \n- a process that would change its chemical and   physical characteristics beyond it's original \nform. So it changes, it transforms into a new   substance. And in Islām when a substance changes \ndrastically to another substance it becomes halāl.   So if I have juice and I left it, I forgot about \nit, came back a few weeks later and I found it   turning into vinegar, I know that it went into \nbeing wine then from wine to vinegar. So can I   consume it? The answer is 'Yes'. If it's \nnot deliberate then it changed by itself,   it changed from wine which is harām into a halāl \nsubstance. Likewise, if you irrigate an apple tree   with sewer water. The sewer water is transformed \ninto something that is sweet and pure and healthy   and halāl in an apple, so you can eat that without \nany problem. And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
