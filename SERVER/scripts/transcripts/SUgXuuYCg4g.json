  "transcript": "A Muslim Family and a Muslim Environment and Allah Knows Best Abdul Wali from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh May Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala give you good health and increase your longevity And you as well So Sheikh my question was if somebody is severely addicted to any substance and he has to go through the rehabilitation process In that process he needs to be given regular doses of that particular substance It can even be porn addiction, cocaine addiction, anything So is it permissible for a Muslim to consume it during that rehabilitation process or is it haram? In terms of weaning off such addiction and trying to have a rehabilitation program If it's a medical issue designed and implemented by Muslim doctors, physicians who are practicing Islam And they know what they're doing this is halal, this is permissible With drug addiction sometimes it is impossible if it's difficult but it may be impossible in cases to just kick the habit You have to do it gradually But in other cases such as porn addiction or any other haram substance that you're doing but it has no withdrawal effects on you No you have to stop immediately You can't say okay I'm not gonna do triple X I'm gonna just do double X Okay no okay next week I'm gonna just do rated R No you have to stop this totally Thank you"
