  "title": "How to balance between what we learn in the university & the Deen? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Firstly, Sheikh, I'd like to thank you on behalf of some of the youth from a local university, University of Nairobi here, for the talk that you've given us. It's covered a lot of aspects that we definitely can apply in our lives. Shukran for that. And on to my question, Sheikh. I'd like to hear your views and your advice to university students, in terms of how can we balance our faith and keeping our Iman with some of the things we are taught in the university. I'm happy you touched on atheism as well, because some of the debates we have, obviously, touch on these specific aspects. And being a law student as well, there's other things that touch on that may not necessarily be relevant in Islam. Some of them being Riba, for example, and some of the things we learn in criminal law, for example. So I'd like to hear what is your advice and your take on this. Okay. Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem. Alhamdulillah wa salatu wa salamu ala rasoolillah wa ala alihi wa sahbihi wa man ahtadha bihudahu amma ba'du. Now, when we address such problems, we have to adhere to the fact that we do not live in a bubble. Unfortunately, we do not live in utopia. The time of the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam and the companions is not existing at the moment. This is what we're striving to reach. And we're doing our level best to come as close as possible, but it is not applicable at this moment. So maybe we can achieve 40%, 70%. If we can reach 100%, then this is, inshallah, the optimum. But realistically speaking, let's come down to earth. This is not the fact. So we cannot say to people, okay, what you're studying in university is wrong. Leave. Okay, I have to work. Oh, there is free mixing. Leave. I'll be a janitor. Oh, you have to clean beer bottles and whiskey. Leave. What should I do? I don't know. No, this is not realistic. We have to look and assess the issue and do our level best in means that would please Allah. So if I'm studying law, now we know that Muslims must not implement and apply man-made laws, because as per ayah 44, 45, and 47 in surah al-ma'idah, So I cannot legislate anything that goes against the sharia. This is kufr. But what should I do? The Muslims need lawyers to take their rights from companies that have corrupted their businesses, stolen their money, cheated on them. Victims need advocates to call the courts to their cases and get their justice done. So as long as you are working within the parameters of sharia, to the best of your ability, you're in good hands. The moment you start to defend criminals, you know he's a criminal, but you know there are loopholes in the system. I can fix it. You have to pay a little bit more. You are a criminal as well. The moment you implement or legislate like a lawyer or a judge or a legislator, haram law. When they come and say, okay, we have this law that selling alcohol is permitted for those who are above 18 years of age. So okay, what do you mean okay? Even if it is above 60 years of age, it is not permissible for you even to vote on such a legislation unless you can make a difference of banning it according to Islam. So this is what you should do. Likewise, when you study biology and they teach you about Darwinism and evolution, I know this is kufr, but I have to be smart. I need to do this course in order to become a biology teacher or to be a scientist. I cannot say haram, haram, haram and leave and let everything go to the disbelievers and to those who are not as efficient and as sincere as I am. So you have to look within the boundaries. Now, alhamdulillah, you have scholars that you can come to and consult in your country and they would, inshallah, guide you more. I don't know if this answers your question or not."
