  "transcript": "Khurram from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh how are you feeling today? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah, Sheikh you answered a part of this question before but not the part I'm about to ask I just want to know whether the scholar who gave the fatwa or the doctor who gave this advice be responsible for the sin if a person with chronic OCD but not insane who has been labeled exempted from Salah by the doctor and a scholar stops offering Salah He is of course indeed sinful for giving such an open check for someone who is not insane to leave Salat no one can do this and that chronic patient is also sinful is not exempted because this is a pillar of Islam no one can come and say well I have a fatwa that says I don't have to pay Zakat yes I'm a millionaire but I have my reasons or someone coming and say Alhamdulillah I can fast I have no chronic illness and I'm not a traveler but I have a fatwa no Islam doesn't work like this each and every individual is accountable for his actions even if the whole world gives him a fatwa it doesn't change the verdict Ibrahim peace be upon him was the only Muslim on earth at the time and everybody else was worshipping the stars and the idols he did not take their fatwa and said well if you can't beat them join them no he held his ground and remained steadfast and continued to call for the truth and this is what we all should do and Allah knows best Thank you."
