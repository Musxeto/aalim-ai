  "transcript": "said said please talk about the danger of speaking about allah's deen without or with little knowledge this is a problem nowadays with the social media everybody wants to be famous and it is unfortunate when someone wants to become famous on the account of islam and therefore you find people who do not possess knowledge they don't have knowledge of the quran and the sunnah yes they heard the fatwa from here and there but this doesn't make them students of knowledge or researchers or scholars and yet they want to be famous well-known prominent you end up finding them sitting in a masjid giving a speech and if a person only talks about the things he knows that's great but the problem is when you speak without knowledge allah azzawajal mentioned in chapter 7 number 33 and let me read the translation because i do not know the translation quran dot com so it is 7 33 i have the i in arabic but failed to find it in english which is okay okay now we have it so allah says in this beautiful ayah the four categories of things that are haram so allah says say my lord has only forbidden open and secret indecency sinfulness unjust aggression thirdly associating others with allah in worship a practice has never been authorized and fourthly attributing to allah what you do not know attributing to allah what you do not know speaking on allah's religion without knowledge i think that this issue is haram no i think this is okay who are you to think i remember 36 years ago i used to call sheikh membas those were the four known scholars at my time at the time i used to call them every single day with a a pad with questions that i write throughout the day when i read books and i asked him so i remember once i asked sheikh hassan may allah have mercy on his soul about the ruling on making diamonds prohibited for men according to the analogy that gold is forbidden for men to wear so diamonds are more expensive and more feminine so i said can we make it haram as well and the guy bursted in my face saying who are you to say can we make diamonds haram as well who are you to have a we to say we do nothing you're not anything analogy christ has men scholars who take care of it who looks into it who study and research not people randomly coming and speaking in the religion of allah without knowledge that was an eye-opener for me it was like cold water being poured over my body thinking that he's right we don't have the authority to speak out of our own whims and desires because we do not possess the necessary tools that makes that make us scholars if we don't know arabic classical arabic with the sciences of it you cannot be called be called a scholar if you don't know the seed of the quran if you don't know usually if you don't know the according to the four schools of thought and how to compare them if you don't know the hadith of the prophet and which is weak and which is authentic and how to authenticate it and you don't know the meaning of the hadith according to the interpreters of the hadith among the scholars in the different books if you don't or if you had not spent long years studying with scholars from their knowledge and from their etiquette and their behavior you cannot be a scholar so definitely speaking about islam with minimal knowledge is fatal i see some of the brothers either so open to speak without knowledge that they are on social media now known as diaries and in contrast there are students of knowledge who are well based and educated refusing to appear or to teach saying that no no we still have more to learn we want to do and they are almost scholars this is how shaytaan mess up with their minds both sides if you don't have if you have knowledge perfect knowledge in what you know yes go ahead and teach it but if you don't have knowledge that is strong in what you know then you should avoid trying to be publicized or to be famous because this is a death trap this is a killer when all what you care about is how many followers do i have how many views did i get how many platforms recognize me or invite me for conferences and and you think at the end of the day that i am you never quote a sheikh or a scholar or an imam all what you say is from your own pocket so that you are not labeled but talking about the religion of allah is a serious thing and by allah if i'm talking about myself if i was not pushed to teach and address such issues i would not have done that believe me there's nothing better than being unknown being idle worshipping allah on your own staying with your family having quality time do whatever you want instead of this but unfortunately we are forced and pushed to do this which we hope and and pray to allah that we're sincere in what we're doing and that we only seek allah's face by it but at the end of the day a person who does not have sufficient knowledge should not place himself as a bridge between the edges of hellfire where people cross over his body they ask you they come and ask me what's the ruling of this what's the ruling on that if you don't know just simply say i don't know no harm done but to feel embarrassed that no i have to give a fatwa i have to give an answer when you're not qualified maybe most of the times you're right but there are times that you're wrong and you have no justification for being wrong except that you were forced to speak no nobody forces you to speak therefore be careful from this may allah make me and you among those who listen to the good speech and fair speech and follow the best of it"
