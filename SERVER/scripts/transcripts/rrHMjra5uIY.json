  "transcript": "Zacky says can we apply perfume that has alcohol in it and can we also pray in it okay what is the issue of alcohol a lot of the people have concerns regarding the alcohol that is applied on the body and under clothes it's not pure alcohol it is perfume mixed with alcohol so they say can we pray is it neji's where does the root of the problem comes from come from first of all scholars differed long ago and it's there in the in their books whether intoxicants and generally speaking they refer to it as wine whether wine is physically impure or it's only spiritually impure now they have different opinions some say it is physically impure so if I have a drop of wine on my clothes then I cannot pray because my clothes is considered and rendered as neji's impure so they considered wine as an impurity and they have a lot of evidences to back them up but these evidences are not clear they're a bit ambiguous and can have double meaning the verse in Surat al-ma'idah in the mohamed elmeshad ensemble as written minimally Shaitaan that verily in talk wine gambling the idols and the lots that they draw to decide where to do what to and where to go our wrists so ridges one of its meaning is an impurity something that is filthy and one of its meaning as well it can also refer to sinful something that is bad and it's from the actions of Shaitaan refrain from it so those who say that wine is neji's is impure they refer to this ayah however scholars that say it is pure though it's prohibited but it is pure it doesn't affect your purity they've argued that Allah Azza WA JAL stated that wine and gambling so is gambling neji's an impurity the answer is no when we play poker or blackjack or whatever this is gambling this is Haram when I buy a lottery ticket this is gambling it's Haram but do I have to wash my hands do I have to perform model no scholar says that you do therefore they say that it's a clear indication that it is not physically impure now putting this aside when we come to alcohol alcohol is not wine but because it is a component of wine and it is the main reason for people to get wasted and intoxicated the later scholars considered it to have the same ruling as wine and hence once you mix it up with perfume is it not just now or not let's go back to the books of the old scholars to see whether wine is impure or pure but realistically alcohol is not wine if you drink a glass of pure alcohol you'll die even before you get intoxicated you simply die so coming to the other side when the scholars stated that it is pure they have back their opinion with a number of different evidences one of them the hadith of anis may Allah be pleased with him and that is when the final ayah was revealed in prohibiting wine totally because we know that there were three stages for wine prohibition the first one they ask you about wine and gambling or may sell and say that there is benefits and there is great sense in it and the sin far exceeds the benefits so this is prohibition number one it's not prohibited but you should not do it then stage two when Allah so as well stated that you must not pray in a state of intoxication until you realize and understand until you are conscience of what you are saying so this limits the time for you to get wasted but there's no prohibition yet thirdly it is when Allah said refrain from it calles it's over so the scholars use this as an evidence because an assembly Malik said when this ayah was revealed immediately all the Companions poured out spilled out the wine they had in the skin bags and the streets of Medina was were flooded with wine that ran like rivers everybody got rid of their what whatever they had in their cellars it's over it's done so the Prophet did not tell them to wash it the Prophet did not tell them to take their shoes off when they entered the message because they walked on these muddy saturated grounds with wine which indicates that it is pure and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars that alcohol wine wine is Haram it's totally prohibited to make to buy to carry to serve let alone to drink now wine and alcohol are not impure they are pure in the sense that if you have a drop if you touch it you don't have to perform model or to wash your self or to wash your hands having said that it is totally permissible to wear and to put on perfume that is alcohol-based and to pray in it without any problem whether you are a man or a woman now for women there is a disclaimer which most of you know but that's it's a reminder that a Muslim woman is not allowed to wear perfume and pass by men who would find her scent and smell the Prophet cetera so Sam whoever goes out of her home wearing perfume and passes by men who would smell her fragrance then she is like a fornicator like an adulteress which is a major sin why is that simply because men are easily affected by whatever a woman puts on"
