  "title": "Can an agreement be changed by both parties or is this breaking a promise (oath)?",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing uh rafi from the us all right um my question is about uh an agreement like say if one makes an agreement with his father can that agreement be changed with the consent of both parties like for example if my dad said he would not let me eat food from like the store for a month and then a few days later i can ask him if i can go to the store does this constitute us breaking a promise as long as this was not a vow or an oath so neither one of you took the name of allah he did not say wallahi you will not eat from that particular store or you said you did not say i will never eat from that particular store within the month period which you designated you did not take the name of allah and what is what it was just agreement you just he just told you i don't want you to eat from that store and he said okay and a week later maybe or a day later or even an hour later you went and and begged them said dad i'm hungry please can i just for one last time i promise you i will not do that particular thing again and he says okay go ahead this is consensual both of you agree and there is nothing wrong even if it was a commercial agreement between you and another party or between you and your partner as long as it's consensual and both agree there's no problem in that inshallah you"
