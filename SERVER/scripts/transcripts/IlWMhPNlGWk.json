  "title": "Qunoot in witr: Can we recite our own duas in our own language?",
  "transcript": "Ayisha sent a question she says how to make pollute in Witter and can we recite our own doors in our own language as Connaught or any other drugs from the Quran the scholars generally speaking say that who note in Witter is a place and a location for DRA and other scholars may expand a little bit so they say that in Recor it's a place of door between the two edge there is a place of dry the most authentic opinion is that Institute is the best place for you to make duaa or before concluding your salat with salam after the salutation of the Prophet that is awesome until the actual conclusion of your prayer this is a gap or a time or a place where it is highly recommended for you to make duaa what about Knut Knut in Whittier this was reported by Al Hasan of nur Ali may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he was a child of seven or eight years of age he came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and imagined this child of six seven or eight years of age coming to his grandfather and saying to him o prophet of allah teach me a dua i should recite in Knut so the Prophet taught him a lease or some ilaha medina femen had eight a short draw we know of so the scholars say that this is appropriate for you to do in whitter there's no problem in that because hadith is authentic yet other scholars have expanded a bit so some said that you can say other draw as well and these are the majority of the scholars say you can add good-doers with good meanings which means that if a person states or says Dora from the Quran Rob bana a TNF in dunya has a novel no Kannada but not as good if someone says do as from the Sunnah Allah Holman L do become in happier has an ideal Castle this is great if someone has other types of dua and he makes it and forms it there is no problem in that none whatsoever but to say it in other languages it's an issue of dispute among scholars it seems to me that if a person does not know how to make the draw in Arabic there's no problem in saying it in his native language so you want to ask Allah for forgivness everyone knows how to say Allah mother fiddly but you want to ask a lot there was L to grant your child recovery from its illness whoa this is too much I don't know how to say that in Arabic say it in your own language no problem do I say it in Knut it's an issue of dispute I personally prefer that you restrict your dua to what is known in the Knut of Whittier and preferably to make it as short as possible well we see in Ramadan people and Imams doing it for like half an hour or 45 minutes this is too much this is more closer to a clear innovation than a preferred time for draw what are you looking for you want a lot to respond to you do it in your sujood and allah azza wajal knows best"
