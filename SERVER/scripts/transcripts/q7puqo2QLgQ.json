  "transcript": "his second question sajid from bangladesh says that my roommate is a blind follower of a medhab how can i make dawah to him you can lead a horse to water you cannot force the horse to drink yes the horse would come with you all the way to the river but you can't put the horse's head in the water and force it to drink so the best way of convincing such blind followers is to study the quran into the sunnah that's it quran is there for everyone to see and read and the sunnah of authentics muslim and all the four books of the sunnah etc they're all there let's study them if you're a true muslim if he declines like some of the people say that no no no difference of opinions and studying makes people dispute and fills their heart with enmity and grudges against one another this is ignorance this is total ignorance allah ordered us in the quran if you still believe in the quran that if you have a dispute among one another refer it back to allah and to the messenger of pro of allah meaning refer it back to the quran and to the sunnah so whenever we have a dispute about an issue in fuk we have to go back to the quran the sunnah but if your roommate is a blind follower he doesn't care what the quran says he doesn't care what the prophet says as well all what he cares about is what imam ahmed or what imam shafir wrote or what imam alex say this is it he doesn't care this is bad news this person is bad news you don't talk to such people who are blind followers refusing to implement the shahadah muhammadan they're refusing to implement it in their lives and they say no no no this is said aside despite our conviction in it or not what we believe in is our school of thought this is what we will follow till the end of times so yadi you have to weigh the pros and cons and see what you can do"
