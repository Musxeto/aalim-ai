  "title": "Is praying Taraweeh mandatory? What is it's reward? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "taraweeh is not mandatory so when you say is it a must no it's not must it's highly recommended you do it you get big amount of reward you don't do it you're not sinful if you offer the taraweeh and Witter with the Imam in the Masjid Allah would give you the reward as if you have prayed the whole night one says okay then why do we pray the head judge before fetcher simply because you want more reward so one night is not enough you'd like to get 1.5 night or maybe more especially in the last 10 nights of ramadan therefore it is highly recommended to offer tahajud prayer but it is not mandatory whether in the first 20 days of Ramadan or in the last 10 nights of Ramadan it is not mandated but it's highly recommended it's like telling you would you like me to give you a gift of a thousand reals or 1 million Riel anyone who would say a thousand Riel would do would be crazy and likewise in this season of good deeds anyone who says I'll just suffice it will suffice me to pray taraweeh and I don't want the Hajj I don't want p.m. he would be like that and Allah knows best"
