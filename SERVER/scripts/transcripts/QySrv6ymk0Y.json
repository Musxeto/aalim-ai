  "title": "Feeling ashamed to lower the gaze because it makes women feel uneasy | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "navamsa if we go to a hospital or a hotel or any place where there are female receptionists how do we communicate with them while allah has ordered us to lower our gaze it's very simple never you look downwards you look sideways you do not look them in the eyes and communicate with them as if lowering the gaze is not mandatory you are allowed to communicate in necessities in times of necessity but you do not look at them you do not smile you do not crack jokes you do not socialize you do not like nice earrings we didn't get them from you do not flirt because a Muslim does not do these things so you must lower your gaze and subhanAllah so many brothers come to me and say sure we feel ashamed lowering our gaze because we look weird and the people in front of us would not feel easy and we would like to represent Islam in a nice way these are all traps and steps of Shaitaan who cares if they're uneasy if I do not look at them I'm communicating with them what else do they want so you don't know you have to have eye contact chair and ok ok can we have something else a little bit more advanced then shaking hands would be ok yeah that's nice if you're in Spain a kiss on the cheek would be a little bit moderate and respectful well is this going to end what defines how I deal with others what sets the parameters is it culture is it logic or is it my religion see a lot of the Muslims have lost their compass and they are lost they're like changing their colors every now and then well they should remain steadfast this is my religion if someone wants to prosecute me for my views don't prosecute me prosecute Islam when I say that this thing is Haram I didn't say it from my own pocket it's the Prophet who said la is a lot of Salaam it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah on the day of judgment to travel without a maja so it's not permissible I wasn't the one who said it it's a prophet as soon you want to prosecute someone I'm not anyone I'm just the messenger don't kill the messenger likewise when it comes to different areas of our religion why don't you have free mixing why do you degrade women and not look at them well I'm not degrading them I'm respecting them when I do not look at someone who has a high status in Islam when I do not look at a ruler or a CEO out of respect when I do not look eye to eye with my father because I respect him I'm not degrading him and this is what we're supposed to do in Islam to respect unlike what's happening with those who do not abide by the Islamic rulings so you really have to be proud of a religion and remain steadfast and not care about what people say if it's going to affect the way I practice my Islam and I hope this answers your question you"
