  "title": "Sinful for disobeying Traffic Rules? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh our first caller is hamza from bosnia uh i've got a question about disrespecting traffic rules so i heard that following traffic rules is mandatory as long as it doesn't go against the quran and sunnah and as long as it's benefiting people which supposedly means that we are simple for over speeding or not stopping at the stop traffic sign even if there is no traffic around us so shay if this is true could you please say what is the evidence for this i don't know what the evidence is other than as muslims we are obliged to obey the rules of the country we live in so if i go to england for example i apply for a visa and in the visa i sign that i will abide by the laws of this country which means that whenever i'm driving although they drive weirdly on the wrong side of the road but whenever i'm driving if there is a a crossing for pedestrians it's mandatory for me to totally stop unlike in the arab world it's your fault if you cross and i hit you no it this is respectful for the pedestrians so they walk without even looking because they know that you wouldn't dare cross that and and harm them so yes i signed a paper declaring that i'll abide i should abide if i don't i'm sinful now coming to the point which you introduce your question saying that you have to obey it as long as it doesn't defy the quran the sunnah i don't see in the quran in the sunnah anywhere that says you shouldn't go faster than 80 kilometers in a specific road so this is not in the quran the sunnah but this is common sense so if there is a stop sign and there is no one around you and you don't stop and there are no cameras and you're 110 certain that the whole road is open to you and there's nobody in nobody tells you that oh if you don't stop you're sinful there's no sin in that what's the worst thing that could happen that cameras would catch you and you will get a fine pay the fine and leave but yes crossing a red traffic a light or exceeding the speed limit when it's dangerous when it may cause harm to yourself or to others this becomes sinful and you're breaking the law so i hope this answers your question you"
