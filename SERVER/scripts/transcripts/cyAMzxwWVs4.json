  "transcript": "hamza from bosnia so sheikh if a person's iman is not that high so he doesn't pray that many voluntary prayers at home but when the person is at his workplace his job description is such that he has lots of free time and he offers voluntary prayers there more than he does when he is at home so my question is would this be something to worry about and is this a sign of hypocrisy okay hamza's question is very clear would offering voluntary prayer at work when i have a lot of free time be a sign of hypocrisy because when i'm at home i have a lot of free time i don't offer such voluntary prayers here you can only answer this if you pray noticeably at work when there is no actual work but others are watching you while when you pray home when there are no one watching you you skip voluntary praise and you don't offer any prayers this is a clear indication that your intention is not for the sake of allah but if there is no one at work and no one is watching you and no one is going to praise you and you actually don't have anything to do so you read the quran or you engage in zikr or you stand to pray two raka's of doha for example nobody knows about it this is not a sign of hypocrisy because you're doing it for the sake of allah so you are the judge whether you're doing it for the sake and praise of others or you're doing it for the sake of allah you"
