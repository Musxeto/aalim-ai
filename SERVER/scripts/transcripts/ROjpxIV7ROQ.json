  "transcript": "we have a CD from Germany um unfortunately there are so many brothers and sisters who doesn't know Arabic and because they don't know Arabic there's a like a high chance that they make grammatical error in the prayer in Afghan Etc and they don't like follow Quran because they don't know Arabic in in if they don't read the translation so in order to avoid errors and to uh follow the following the Quran without the translation is Arabic mandatory no Arabic is not mandatory and whatever mistakes they fall into unintentionally and and unwillingly This falls under the last Ayah of Surat al-baqarah where Allah says oh Allah don't hold us accountable if we were to forget or to make an error so making a mistake or an error unwillingly unintentionally this is not sinful and we cannot obligate people to learn Arabic which is not mandatory upon them yes it's highly recommended are they rewarded definitely big time and I tell this to everyone who does not know Arabic strive to learn Arabic to the best of your ability because this is the best way to get closer to Allah when you read the Quran and know what you're reading without having to go to translation and when you read the Hadith and can be able to understand what the prophet said Allah commanded without having to refer to me or to someone else to translate it to you you can take it straight from the Hadith itself and it's like the difference between the heavens and the Earth between someone who does not know Arabic and someone who does and Allah Knows Best"
