  "transcript": "Romar says my question is I'm reading my intention Nia in my mind before takbeer to a harem of my salat is this the right way to make intention the answer is no when you visualize your nia in your head and you say okay I intend but you don't speak it out I intend to pray the for raka however not kabah etc this is an innovation no one does this I want to check if I have any important whatsapp messages from the admin and the phone is in front of me so I just simply do this I do not say in my mind okay now you're gonna reach out to the mobile with your right hand not your left and you're gonna press the start button with your fingerprint and check the messages nobody does this when you want to go and relieve yourself in the bathroom you don't say I intend to go to make number two in the bathroom next to my bedroom and it will take me about five minutes nobody this is insane intention is zero in your heart you want to make what oh go ahead Mikado don't think I want to do this because this is how Shaitaan enters to your mind and Allah knows best"
