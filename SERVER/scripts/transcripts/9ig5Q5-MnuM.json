  "title": "Is it permissible to make Takfeer on those who do not pray? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now what is the ruling on those who do not pray I don't know if we're going to talk to this to talk about this later on but if you look at the verses of the Koran such as that ensure that Toba or in certain wood death there or elsewhere and combine to it the different narrations of the prophet a prophetic Sunnah of the Prophet Aristotle you will find that we have a theoretical and a practical ruling so the theoretical ruling is anyone who does not pray is a kafir and this is established through the Quran as well as the Sunnah the theoretical ruling means that I do not implement it on an individual what does that mean I do not come to a person and I say do you pray he says no I don't pray so I say okay one plus one equals two a person who doesn't pray is a kafir and this individual does not pray is but that this individual does not pray then just equals he is a kafir this is totally wrong because in order to implement this practically there are conditions to be fulfilled and there are obstacles to be eliminated without implementing this we cannot say that an individual is a kafir and this is why a lot of the sisters come to me and say share my husband abuses me he battles me he insults me he doesn't provide for me and I say you have to weigh the consequences weigh the pros and cons because I don't want you to become angry or regretful after asking divorce you have to be patient give him that way so she because she wants out of the marriage she says and he doesn't trick so when I hear this and say what do you mean by d-doesn't pray he doesn't pray at all she wants me to conclude that oh if it doesn't pray that he's a kafir then your marriage is void by default people come to me and say my father he doesn't pray not a single prayer and I follow the opinion that whoever does not raise a kafir so he died what should I do with the wealth he left because I will not inherit him all of this is strong the default that that individual is a Muslim he claims to be a Muslim he says he's a Muslim all those around him acknowledge that he's a Muslim the problem is if you want to get him out of the fold of Islam this is not for you and you you have to fulfill the conditions that he is willing that is knowledgeable that he is not misinterpreting that is not confused of the ruling because that is not forced for example all of these conditions and obstacles must be eliminated and fulfilled at the same time for the conditions and eliminated for the obstacles and this is usually done by a panel of judges who would sit with the individual si ahi you don't pray see ya don't straight I believe it's melted by the don't pray no you have to pray because this is mandated Allah oblige you to pray bla bla bla he says I understand but I'm not gonna pray now you're talking to a panel of judges they say put him in jail for three days so every day come and pray no I believe in the obligation of prayer but I don't want to pray for three days he's given a chance to show remorse and pray yet he's arrogant and he is insisting not to pray scholars say such an individual is not a Muslim anymore and he is to be executed and his execution is not a prescribed punishment rather it is for his apostasy and his treatise as in a post an apostate and he does not receive the funeral rites of a Muslim he is not washed shrouded buried in a Muslim Cemetery at all so this is something that we have to acknowledge and understand before going into what as they say shooting from the hip anyone that doesn't pray we just simply say Hamas is a kafir and we take him out of the millah of Islam we will go into details of course about salat etc but Yanni inshallah this is just a preview the third pillar of Islam is as the cat as the cat is mostly associated with prayer in the verses of the Quran a farm of salata were artists the cat always you find them combined or joined usually and the cat is defined linguistically and technically like most of the forms of worship and salat for example linguistically it is dua and technically it it is specific movements and rhetorics at specific times inaugurated by takbir at all harm and concluded by as-salaam so when we come to the cart it's the same thing the cat linguistically is growth and increase and it also relates to purity and cleansing and good behavior now paying the cat without a doubt cleanses your rook record book from since it erases it not only that it cleanses your soul and this is why Allah ordered Mohammed alehissalaam saw our prophet to take the cat from them to take charity to purify them with it so when you give it purifies is your soul when you give the poor in the needy it purifies is your soul and it also provides is you from different types of sins and zakat is defined technically as a duty paid by certain individuals over a specific amount which is the threshold on specific categories such as gold silver cash things that grow up from the earth crops that is cattle livestock and merchandise that is for sale providing that the time circulation has taken place which is known as allowed and we will come to talked about this insha'Allah in the future if Allah is willing now this is a cat is not given randomly it must be given to a specific category one out of eight mentioned in ayah number sixty in Chapter number nine surah at-taubah these eight categories are the only recipients of zakat money the cat is a laws right in our wealth so when salat is required to be performed by an individual who is saying who's reached the age of puberty who's accountable zakat is unlike that even if an individual is insane or we have an orphan six years old five years old who has inherited a million we must take the cat from this wealth though the owner is not accountable and this is the most authentic opinion because it is ullas right in that wealth and there are so many any other rulings on that the fourth pillar of Islam is fasting in Arabic fasting is to refrain so you can refrain from speaking you can refrain from major sins you can refrain from eating and drinking this is all linguistically called fasting in the technical term fasting is to abstain to the frame from anything that nullifies your fasting of the things that we will come to list in sha allah from dawn till sunset with the intention of worshipping allah and this is a very important addition because you can refrain from eating and drinking from the break of dawn till sunset because you are dieting because you are testing yourself because you don't feel like eating but this is not to say that to be islamic fasting Islamic fasting has to be accompanied by the intention which is to worship Allah the all-mighty now fasting the days of the month of Ramadan is the pillar we're talking about so when we say about the fourth pillar of Islam is fasting we don't mean fasting Mondays and Thursdays this is emphatic Sunnah we don't refer to fasting the three white days or Arafah or most delica these are all voluntary fasting we only mean about fasting the month of Ramadan this is what the Prophet said that is salatu was-salam to one of his companions who came and asked him about it he said to fast the month of Ramadan and the Companions wanted emphasis and to be sure and he said nothing else and the Prophet says well nothing else except if you want to volunteer so this is what is a pillar of Islam the cat which was previously mentioned is different than charity you are obliged to give 2.5 percent of your savings of cash gold or silver if they reach the threshold and a holy lunar year passes but you can give more as charity not as the cat and the sky is the limit so no one talks about charity and says that this is mandated know what is mandatory what is a pillar is a cat the percentage two point five percent can be five percent can be ten percent depending on the thing that we are giving the cat over and we will come to discuss this insha'Allah later on so the fasting of Ramadan is one of the pillars of Islam you miss it because you're sick or because you're traveling or a woman has a monthly period or you are old and unable all of this would be looked into insha'Allah later on the final pillar is hatch which is known as pilgrimage and linguistically pilgrimage is in Arabic Allah Sandow which is setting off for a definite destination technically it is traveling to Mecca to perform this ritual according to the particular manner at a specific time and under specific conditions and hatch is mandated once in a lifetime so every Muslim who's capable physically and financially and has no barriers to prevent him from performing Hajj must perform it once in a lifetime and there are conditions and there are ways and there are things that are related to this a woman without a Muharram cannot perform Hajj and it's not mandated upon her until she is able to find a Muharram Allah says pilgrimage to his house is a duty owed to Allah by all people who are able to undertake it so it is a an obligation upon people and also the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam in the hadith of even Omar may Allah be pleased with him and his father Islam has been built on five pillars one testifying that there is no deity worthy of being worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger al Assad Salam to performing the prayers three praying the zakat for making the pilgrimage to the house five and fasting in Ramadan and this was narrated by Bihari and reported by Bukhari and Muslim therefore these are the five pillars of Islam which each and every Muslim on earth most likely know them by heart and most likely try their level best to abide by them as they are the basics of Islam then we elevate to the higher level which is Eman and it's six pillars then we elevate to a lesson but the bare minimum that would help us identify an individual as a Muslim is to commit to these five pillars"
