  "transcript": "yes uh on one of the uh youtube videos chef assume mentioned that making dua after every prayer is the innovation uh recently i was reading a book the disease and the curve by ibrahim in in his book he mentioned the six prescribed times of response of and one of them he mentioned this complication immediately upon completion of five obligatory players uh uh i think the brother is confused regarding uh after the salah or after you complete that the opinion of it okay yeah please if you kind of certify that yeah brother abu yusuf from saint louis missouri was asking about the issue that many muslims ask about there is an authentic hadith in imam muslim that the most heard responded and answered are the ones in the middle of the night and at the end of the fall prayers the translations that all the people have is after the far prayers and in the arabic word is now and the scholars like imitating said that a thing is from it not after it so dab is from the dabba itself from the animal self therefore the translation is the cause of confusion now never ever we had an incident where the companion said that the prophet salam after every false allah used to raise his hands and say the dua and as many of us do wipe the his face and wipe his body where are you guys getting this from not only that the prophet himself advised us if you guys want allah to answer your dua don't you of course why are we making dua after salah so allah would answer us so i'll give you what the prophet told us the prophet told us number one if you pray in your if you make dua in your sujud you're as closest as you can be to allah azzawajal and it is going to be answered box one check he said after offering salutation at the end of this of the last raka choose whatever dua you want this is before salaam check box 2 this case this is where you get your answer now tell me what is the reason for making dua after salat wallahi most likely so that i would not have to pay expiation wallahi most likely you are making dua because it's a cultural thing because everybody does it so what the heck am i more the roman than the romans let's go with the flow but if you want to follow the sunnah do it in your sujud or do it before your salaam after salam it's a place for vicar and some of the thicker may contain dua but it's prescribed by the prophet salam not like we do allah knows well you know they categorized it no"
