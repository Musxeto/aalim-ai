  "title": "Should I go to a Masjid that has images & has a TV room where they watch haram things",
  "transcript": "government from Sweden so I've gone straight to the point there's this mosque in my neighborhood but the mosque has images there is photographs of the previous leaders that organized the mosque that may or may not be edited on our wall thankfully but this images is outside the Masjid but the message Masjid has a painting of the Kaaba with people doing tawaf around it but these people they don't have facial features but it is understood they are human and they are worshipers also the Masjid has a bookshelf which contains books that contain images of the authors of these books on the backside also the mask is sometimes used to watch football and TV that crane that contain Haram stuff that is but it is outside the Masjid in a Gathering Room so and also some my question is is should I go to this Masjid if this is the only Masjid that with is within your vicinity and it's the easiest for you to go all of the things that you've mentioned do not make the Salat unaccepted the Salat is accepted inshallah there is no shirk yes it is illogical to have these things in there a a room within the message boundaries to watch football what kind of a mess it is what kind of a ma'am and a board that governs this Masjid definitely these guys are twisted but unfortunately you live in a kaffir country there is notorious to um the way they deal with Islam though they're sugar coated but we know their intentions so at the end of the day this is the best of your ability if there is another message that is salafi that is following the Sunnah that is a little bit further but you can go there you should but if most likely this is the only message within the vicinity go try to get acquainted to the management to the Imam and little by little don't expose yourself and put your cards on the table so that they won't label you'd rather try level by your uh uh best of ability to show them the evidences from the Quran from the Sunnah issue by issue maybe Allah would guide them on your hands"
