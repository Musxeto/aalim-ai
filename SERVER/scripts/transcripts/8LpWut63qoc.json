  "transcript": "dr.mohammed says I'm keeping a beard and lately have started increasing its length it's curly and my father says that I should trim it slightly so that it appears nice and not haphazard I'm worried please guide it is not permissible dr.mohammed to trim the beard according to the most authentic opinion there are two authentic or strong opinions one stating that it is prohibited and the other stating that it is permissible providing that you grab a fist and cut what exceeds of it so this is the limit not the other way around the people do this and they cut on top no it's from the bottom and I support the opinion that says that one should not trim it or take anything of it now in your case you can put softeners you can put relaxers or whatever they call them on your beard so that it would not become curly it would be straight providing that it's not harmful for you and there's nothing wrong in taking care of it coming it brushing it shampooing it even putting conditioner on it there is no problem none whatsoever in that shower"
