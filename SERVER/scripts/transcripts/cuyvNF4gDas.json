  "title": "A man ate pork & then drank from my glass, how far does the impurity spread? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Younus from Germany, Assalamu Alaikum, there came a man to our house and he said that he ate pork and then he drank from a glass of water, so some of his spit came on there, okay, and he ate pork like a few hours ago, so I know there was Neshasa on that glass and that glass was wiped with a sponge and this sponge came on many other things and I know you are sometimes hesitant to answer such questions, but give me an idea how far does it spread, is it ten plates, is it one touch, is it twenty plates, is not the whole kitchen Neshasa, must I burn the house, just tell me a rough idea how far does it spread, one spread, two spread? Ya Younus, Ya Younus, this is not good, why? Because what you're doing is cascading things, it is a ripple effect that shaitan is throwing in your head, this is exaggeration and overthinking, now he ate pork and dead meat and living monkeys and dogs and whatever, definitely 100% najis, he is not najis, his sweat is not najis and his saliva is not najis, because when I describe what is on the glass, I say a man's saliva, I wouldn't say it's pork, I wouldn't say it's rotten dogs, it's saliva, now when someone drinks from a glass and there is a saliva, I don't take it to the lab and ask them please can you check what he had for dinner and lunch the past 12 hours, just to know whether it's najis or not, so you don't have to burn the house, you don't have to check, you don't have to wash your hands after shaking hands with him, because there is no pork on my hand, there is no pork on the glass, so don't let shaitan exaggerate things in your head that has no basis, ask yourself two questions, number one, is Islam a religion of ease and simplicity or number two, is Islam a religion of hardship and difficulty, of course you're going to say number one, Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity, ask yourself a second question, what are you practicing in your daily life, ease and simplicity or hardship and difficulty, you're going to say definitely hardship and difficulty, in this case you are not practicing Islam, maybe Buddhism, maybe Hinduism, maybe I don't know what religion you're following, because my religion is not what you're practicing, and I hope this makes sense."
