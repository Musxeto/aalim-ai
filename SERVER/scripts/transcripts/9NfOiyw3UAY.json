  "title": "He sat for Tashahhud in his 1st rakat thinking it was his 2nd, what to do? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Hamis from the UAE So I have a question, if I'm in Sujood and then I say Allahu Akbar, but then I have the intention to stand for the second rak'ah, no the Tashahud, but then I then remember, no I have to do the second rak'ah. So while I'm in Tashahud, do I stand up again or if I didn't do Tashahud, do I do Sujood? So are you telling me that while you are in the second Sujood, you say Allahu Akbar and sit for Tashahud in your first rak'ah, thinking that this is your second rak'ah? Yes, so no, in the first I was doing Sujood and then I said... Which rak'ah? No, no, the first rak'ah, but then I wanted to, I thought it was my second rak'ah. Okay, this is my question, okay, if this is the case and you sit for Tashahud in your first rak'ah and you discover that no this is my first rak'ah, you have to immediately stand up to your second rak'ah without saying Allahu Akbar, because you have already said Allahu Akbar and sat down. So the Takbeer of rising from the Sujood was already said. If you discover that this is the wrong sitting and you want to stand up, you just simply stand up to the second rak'ah and you offer Sujood As-Sahu after the Salam, you offer two prostrations of Sujood As-Sahu and then you offer another Salam. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it Insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
