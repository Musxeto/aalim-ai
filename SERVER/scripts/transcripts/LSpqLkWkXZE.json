  "transcript": "Mu'izz from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Wa Barakatuhu I want to ask you regarding living with a person who has doubts in Islam due to lack of knowledge. Now I'm saying in a non-Muslim country after graduation for a short while you can experience before I move back. I have one more flatmate living in the room next to me within the same apartment and there is contract renewal approaching soon. Initially when choosing the flatmate he told me that he is a Muslim and he still calls himself a Muslim. But as time passed by I can recognize that he has some doubts in Islam and our creator as well. So considering that he respects with the new knowledge he receives of Islam and seems to have potential of coming closer to Islam and I can give tawa while being steadfast as well. I want to respectfully ask you if I can continue with this contract with him. No problem. No problem Alhamdulillah. As long as he does not cast any doubts to you against Islam and you're not threatened by his way of thinking and you're giving him da'wah, that's a win-win Inshallah. Alhamdulillah."
