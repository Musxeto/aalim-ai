  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Qatar I get scared and \noverwhelmingly anxious When approaching   people of knowledge of graduates of Islamic \nuniversities and this makes me stop wanting   to ask them questions so can you please advise \nme on how I can overcome this problem of mine   people's phobia differ there are people who are \nscared of Dark Places there are people who are   scared of closed areas there are people who \nare scared of clowns and your phobia is the   first that I encounter [Questioner] and excuse \nme I'm not making fun of it but it's illogical   the students of the Islamic University of Medina \nthey're like any other students the graduates   of Medina University are not all students of \nknowledge are not all Scholars of Islam some   of them are even deviants depending on their \ninclination and how they proceeded afterwards   yes to get a degree from the Islamic \nUniversity or from the University of   Muhammad the University of Imam whether in \nMedina whether in Riyadh or 'Unayza or elsewhere   to get a degree from um university in Mecca \nthis is these are all prestigious universities   and most likely graduate graduates would be \ndecorated students of knowledge but not always   some of them graduate with a degree maybe in \nMasters or so and they end up driving Uber   or working in a restaurant they don't pursue \nwhat they've learned and they don't share it   with the Muslims and they don't teach and \nresearch and do what they're supposed to do   number one number two your phobia and fear of \nasking them questions is generated by shaytan   the salaf the righteous predecessors \namong the scholars used to say knowledge   is not attained by someone who's arrogant or shy \nan arrogant person says I'm not going to learn   from him what does he know what degree does he \nhold who is he he's just a celebrity he's just   a famous person I'm don't care about him or where \nhe got his knowledge I'm not going to listen to   him this arrogant person will never learn he \nwill always you know be a an ignorant imbecile   a shy person would never learn why because this \nshy person comes to a Circle of Knowledge he gets   a question in his head he wants to ask the \nSheikh because Allah says ask the people of   knowledge if you don't know but then he says Ah \nwhat will the Sheikh say he would probably say   that you're ignorant that you don't know maybe \nhe's going to make fun of me I'm not gonna ask   so he refrains from learning his religion due to \nhis shyness and he would never learn and he would   remain to be an ignorant imbecile as well so you \nhave to cross this line you have to remove this   thin veil of intimidation or fear and ask you \ngo to the greatest Scholars of Islam and don't   be shy ask them whatever you want even if you \nthink it's silly you will never learn you will   never progress and become a better person until \nyou start asking questions and Allah Knows Best"
