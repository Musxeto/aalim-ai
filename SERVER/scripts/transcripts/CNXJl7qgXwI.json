  "title": "Last time to perform Ghusl for Friday prayer? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "f says what is the last time to perform russell for a friday first of all friday russell is an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that it's not mandatory it's highly recommended but the last time to perform it is definitely before going to friday what's the point of not performing russell and going to friday prayers and then coming back and perform russell this has no value it's like going to pray without wudu and then coming back home and performing buddha the russell is related to the prayer itself and this is why it starts from fajr of a friday and it should end by the friday itself because if you attended the prayer without russell then there is no use of it"
