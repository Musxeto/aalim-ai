  "title": "Can a Sales Rep talk to women to convince them to buy the product or is this free mixing",
  "transcript": "Mert from Germany I work at a company where I go to doors and to women sometimes they open the door to sell them something at the example to lower the electricity bills and these things. So Sheikh I speak with them I talk I say it and sometimes they say very fastly no I'm not interested. So this is because they don't have much knowledge they are like they don't trust or skeptic you know. So what they do is sometimes I repeat myself or sometimes I say yes of course you have no interest because if you had interest you would do it yourself you will lower your electricity prices. So I'm here explaining it to you. So as I said like I'm maybe repeating myself two times or three times explain it to her more so that she understands it and then if she after maybe second or third time doesn't want it I say okay goodbye and then I leave. So she has a permissible to speak like this or say it more that she understands it. There is no problem in that as long as you're respectful and not socializing and not chit-chatting or flirting."
