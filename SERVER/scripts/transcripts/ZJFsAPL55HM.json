  "transcript": "mm-hmm [Music] I mean dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamualaikum and welcome to Mercy to Mankind last time we met we talked about the re-digging of zamzam well and one would ask what is the importance of them well what's so special about zamzam that people are making so much fuzz about and wanting to control it and to have the honor of giving access to it to the people zamzam is a sacred water it is sacred water in the sense that the blessing of Allah he's in zamzam our Prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam told us a lot about zamzam and we believe in this holy water in the sense that it has uh characteristics that other water does not have there was a Hadith in Muslim and this Hadith was narrated by abuzar and they used to loot people and hijack things and they were without any objective they just lived the day without knowing what to do tells us about himself as being worshiping Allah azzawajal praying to Allah three years before the prophet salallahu was sent to mankind and those who asked him how did you pray who did you pray to I prayed to Allah I knew that there was a Creator to this universe so what did you do he said I just prayed to whatever Direction I can face I just prayed to Allah to guide me Abu dhar his mother and his brother Anis traveled after a problem took place between them and their uncle and they left and Anis the brother of Abu dhar went to Mecca and came back telling his brother that I heard of a man and I that worships the same God you worship so he told him what was it he told him they say that he is asabi he is an unbeliever of the idols they call him asabe and this was a capital crime that needed punishment so abudhar went to Mecca and he went in secrecy he did not want to announce his presence to the people as he was investigating this so-called prophet and the minute he went into the Masjid to the Haram he saw a man and he went and whispered in his ear and he told him uh what's the news about this Sabe this man who abandoned worshiping the idols this is the only thing he said so it was not very uh obvious he's just asking he's a stranger and the minute this man heard this he shouted in the whole Masjid this is looking for the Sabe this one is looking for the Sabbath which means that he's a follower and immediately everyone picked whatever they could bones or stones and they threw him and beat the hell out of him until he fainted and he was covered with blood and an hour or two later he was left to die because he's a stranger they they had no problem in killing people they had no problem in attacking others especially strangers who had no support or backup or any uh family to protect them so he woke up three or four hours later he went to the will of zamzam and he washed the blood off and he took hiding for a whole month he just he he hided in the Kaaba and in the surrounding area for a whole month he says about himself that I did not have anything to eat for a whole month except the water of zamzam now this is incredible because one would say you cannot live on water alone we say yes but James is not water alone and this is why I mentioned this story to tell you that zamzam water is a sacred water Prophet salallahu told us that the water of zamzam is food to whomever feeds on it and it's secure to whomever seeks cure in it and this has been practiced alhamdulillah by most Muslims by myself by everybody else we find it to be cured to a lot of the diseases if you have an infection if you have problems you just take water of zamzam and drink as much as possible and you will be cured especially in uh protecting our children and curing those who have bad spells Magic on them uh evil eye Envy whatever we tell them bring the water of zamzam recite the fact that blow in it the the last chapters of the Quran three chapters of the Quran either cursive and then drink of it and watch the area that hurts and you suffer of and insha Allah you will find that The Cure in the water of Samson okay but the most important to believe in Allah who kills this this is by default because what made you go to zamzam definitely it's the Sunnah yes and the Sunnah comes from Allah and by no doubt everything a Muslim does is in in accordance to it his belief that Allah is the one that cures yes and for example as Muslims we believe that honey is a form of medicine and researchers are revealing to us that it is indeed one of the greatest cures of of of of of diseases yet if someone takes honey believing that honey by itself cures but it's not Allah this is shirk this is associating someone else with Allah no you have to take honey and you have to believe that Allah is the one that hears you have to get married in order to have children but you have to believe that it is Allah the almighty that grants you and gives you these children to our story again already was given the control over zamzam water but after what after they almost died and perished in the desert after he was overwhelmed by the other families he felt weak and vulnerable so he made an oath to Allah azzawajal did he see a dream like Ishmael like Abrahim or a dream regarding did he know about the story about Abrahim and Ishmael of course everyone knew about this story but he made this oath in order for him to get what he wants it his main objective was to get those strong men his sons beside him to protect him and defend him so he was willing to have nine to sacrifice the tenth so he had he had uh the intention to do this but he was not doing this as a form of worship he just wanted to get the nine uh sons of his he made this oath but he did not forget about it and Allah azzawajal gave him the ten strong healthy sons of his own and when the tenth was born and reaching the age of puberty and they all became strong men beside him he told them that now is the time and I have to fulfill my oath to my Lord the people the family of quresh came to him and said come on you cannot do this all of you your children are wise and strong men we respect them we are willing to do whatever you want but don't do this they are begging him not to kill one of his children though they are not related to him but they respect Abdullah they honor him and at the same time they do not want to see one of his children killed Abdullah did not retreat he said I made an oath and I have to protect my word to my Lord one of them has to die so the people of quresh said no way you cannot do this and they wanted to prevent him even by force so as a compromise they told him let us go to a priest again to a fortune teller again and seek her assistance the solution for all problems at the time yes it was indeed the solution of all problems and unfortunately even nowadays we have presidents that have fortune tellers telling them what to do whether to go into war or not we have uh influential people rich people seeking their knowledge and they don't have any knowledge it's just that man by Nature wants to be led wants someone to give him the direction so that he would relieve himself from responsibility so if you come to me and say do this though I am not determined and I don't want to do it but I'm willing to do it so if it fails I'm gonna blame you for that and if it goes through well I'm going to take all the credit for it so they went to this fortune teller and this fortune teller told him that there is a solution out and that is that we should draw the Lots and see whether it says kill one of your children or a a give 10 camels as sacrifice but before that took place and I forgot to mention this drew the lots to select which one of his children to kill and it was Abdullah the father of our Prophet Muhammad who was chosen to be sacrificed and he was the most beloved Son to his father Abdullah so now the problem is is doubled because it's not one of his sons only but one of the most beloved Sons to himself so they went to this fortune teller and this fortune teller told them you have to draw the lots to know which one to choose and so they did it's a kind of false towards it's a kind of pulse or uh it's the kind of straws it's some of it has or or arrows that says you do this or you do that it's just to choose from it what uh the the decision was to be made Allah and welcome back just before the break we uh discussed how Abdullah and the people of Makkah were in dispute regarding sacrificing one of his sons and the chosen one was Abdullah the father of our messenger Muhammad and when they went to this priest or fortune teller they were told that there is a way out and that is that you choose ask the gods to choose between slaughtering Abdullah or uh 10 camels as sacrifice instead so they drew the Lots and it was said sacrifice Abdullah so they added another 10. and again sacrifice Abdullah and another 10 and another ten another until they reached 100 camels and that was indeed a fortune and when they reached number 100 then the Lord told them that okay sacrifice the camels and Abdullah was spared and he did so why camels specially camels to the Arabs are the most valuable animal around at the time and in the Holy Quran Allah tells us to look at how great and Magnificent the camels are how were they were created and I believe that though we are living in the age of airplanes uh fast trains and transportation and mobiles and so on computer internet yet we did not do the camels uh it's Justice because Allah did not mention the camel in the Quran without any legitimate reason if researchers looked into how the camels are created into their characteristics and Specialties I believe that they will find wonders and wonders of Allah otherwise Allah would not have told us to look into how the camels were created among all animals he only specif specifically chose the camel for us to observe and to research so I believe that we did not do the camel it's Justice by not looking into it but I believe that there will come people and scientists to look into this uh problems it is called the the ship of the desert or whatever because it can live and travel in the desert like no other animal can and it's equipped with so many things in indeed it's a four-wheel drive animal you know it has it's it Provisions in it it has it's it's water and and food and it can go on for seven or ten days without feeding and and subhanallah there are so many things in Camus so Abdullah was spared and the camels were sacrificed to their idols and claiming to be to Allah the almighty and why was that that was to prove to the people of Mecca that Allah has spared Abdullah in order for something that is so high and important and that is to be able uh for Muhammad sallallahu to be born from the offsprings of Abdullah marrying the mother of the Prophet sallam Amina then it's called the behind the son of the two still that is exactly uh precisely how he is called he the prophet sallam said about himself that I I am the son of the two slaughtered ones though they were not slaughtered the first one was Ishmael when in an earlier program Allah has instructed him revealed to him that he must Slaughter his son Ishmael and just as he was about to do that Allah gave him this huge RAM the slaughter and said and this is what all the Muslims do every single year in the festival or in the Eid of and had they sacrifice a sheep a Ram or a cow or a camel this is is also acceptable sacrificing a a camel or a cow suffice seven people but sacrificing one ship is enough for one person and his family those who whom he support and we do this and it's it's very strange you you have people defending the animal animal rights associations you have BB coming every uh now and then saying that Muslims are uh barbaric they're killing animals slaughtering animals and no one defends the humans themselves we have humans being sacrificed like sheep and chechnya and and in Palestine and here and there and nobody stands up and say this is against human rights but when you Slaughter sheep and you feed on these sheep people come and say Islam is a barbaric religion it should a light and it does this and it does that this is the Sunnah and we may never divert from it Eternal Muslims also uh slaughtered animals to eat to feed some of them yes they eat animals but unfortunately the majority do not Slaughter they eat either kill the Animal by hitting it on the head with a hammer or by stinging it or by injecting it or by electrifying it and all of these these forms of of killing makes the animal unlawful for us to kill as Muslims we can only eat the meat of an animal that was slaughtered by a Muslim a Jew or a Christian if these two conditions were not fulfilled then we may not eat this animal and this leads us to another problem which is not within this era that one should be careful of the meat he eats especially if he's not living in Muslim countries it's not enough for you to go and to a restaurant in a country where you know that it the rules and regulations of that country that you may not Slaughter there are countries in Europe that forbids slaughtering animals they say you have to kill the animal first by hitting it with a hammer on the head smashing its skull once it's dead then you may start cutting the meat now this is called meta dead animal we're not allowed to eat from it but we sacrifice animals every year in Hajj because this is the doing of Abraham of Ishmael of our Prophet Muhammad and this is the least painful uh uh procedure to be followed with animals and this is what the the I don't know the uh it's not the Physicians uh it's a the doctors responsible of animals they have a word for that veterinians or something like this yeah the Vets uh so they say by slaughtering an animal though it is shaking and trembling it does not feel anything because you have cut the spinal cord and they are senseless they don't have any sense this is the easiest way the most humane way to kill an animal not like hitting it on the head or electrifying it where it's in pain and misery all the time and again diverting from our main topic uh uh Islam is the most Humane religion and practice to with animals the prophet salallahu tells us that whenever you want to slaughter an animal you have to sharpen your knife it is a sin to slaughter your animal with a Dull Knife though you're gonna kill it eventually but the pain the torture is forbidden and again the prophet tells us that he once saw a man and he the man was slaughtering a sheep and uh at the range while the other sheep were watching in front of other sheep so the prophet was Furious and angry with him and he told him do you want to kill the Sheep twice don't you fear Allah azzawajal whenever you want to slaughter a sheep Slaughter it in isolation from the others so that they do not feel the pain they are animals this is what we think these sheep are animals yet the prophet told us that they have feelings and you may not do this with the animal in front of the others and a religion like this does it promote slaughtering captives does it promote kidnapping and killing people indiscriminately does it promote bombing terrorist attacks no definitely not so who's ever doing this definitely does not know our Prophet does not know our religion and definitely is not a proper Muslim he's really Mercy too mankind that is our Prophet Allah he is the Mercy to Mankind and we will get to this is later on but just as an example the prophet saws once saw a camel and the camel was weeping and The Prophet sallam by Allah azzawajal empowering him got to understand what the camel was saying and he was Furious and he said who's the owner of this camel the man says I'm the owner of the camel o prophet of Allah why aren't you feeding him why are why are you carrying so much on him fear Allah azzawajal be aware that Allah will punish you as you punish this camel this is the mercy not to mankind not to the Jinn he is the mercy to Allah who was sent to All Mankind and to the Jinn and to everyone on this planet so coming back to our uh uh uh uh zamzam uh he Abdullah the father of prophet sallam was spared because of the sacrifice of this 100 camels and nowadays the blood Money you know what the blood money is if someone kills someone by mistake or kills him deliberately then those the the family of the victim have the right either to ask for blood money or to ask for execution the blood money is estimated in 100 camels the value of 100 camels I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time"
