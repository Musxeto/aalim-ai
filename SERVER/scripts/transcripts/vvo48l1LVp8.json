  "title": "My wife took a student loan in the UK & has no plan on paying it off, what to do",
  "transcript": "here from Saudi actually my question is uh you know I'm actually from the UK not from Saudi Arabia but um uh my wife in the UK many years ago uh she went to University and she took a student loan and um like we got married shortly after and um she you know she's she's been a mother ever since and she has no intention or desire or any aim to work so how do we go about paying the car and also related to that are the implications of Hutch whilst having a loan having a debt rather so could you explain this please what are we supposed to do okay first of all student loans are prohibited because they are interest-based loans now to my knowledge in the UK I think they give you 9 000 pounds per year and they set up a condition saying that if you were to earn less than 20 000 pounds a year you don't pay the loan back but if you earn more than that you're forced to pay the loan back in addition to interest and if you happen to die or not earn more than twenty thousand pounds you are forgiven by the government you're Exempted so taking such alone is Haram unfortunately unfortunately a lot of the Muslims had fallen into this major sin unknowingly most likely or thinking that this is a form of a grant from the government like the normal benefits they receive having said that if your wife is not earning and she's not going to work and they she has the concession from the government not to pay it if she doesn't work she is not obliged to pay it off and Allah Knows Best"
