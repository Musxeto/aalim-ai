  "transcript": "Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I hope you are doing well Sheikh Alhamdulillah, thank you for asking Jazak Allah Khair. Sheikh, so my question is if a person who did a lot of major sins and he turned back to Allah like sincerely once and then he continued repenting and he feels the remorse every single day and he continues repenting, can he become a very close slave of Allah and become beloved to Allah at some point in his life if he does a lot of good deeds hoping that Allah will bring him close to Him? Jazak Allah Khair Wa Jazakum If you watch my playlist on YouTube which I did in this blessed channel about three years ago, it was about the beautiful names of Allah and one of Allah's beautiful names is the most forgiving, the most merciful, the one who accepts those who repent to Him Ar-Rahman, Ar-Raheem, At-Tawwab and Al-Ghafoor, the one who forgives So if you acknowledge and know the meaning of Allah's beautiful names and you worship Him and you express your remorse and you do good deeds, Allah's gates of repentance are open for you, anyone who comes and Allah extends His hand to those who sinned in the evening when they repent in the morning and those who sinned in the morning or the daytime when they repent at night time. So don't ever feel despair, yes you can attain the highest levels of Jannah if you work hard for it and Allah would help you in the process May Allah make all of us steadfast on Islam www.mooji.org"
