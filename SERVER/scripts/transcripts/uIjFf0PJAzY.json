  "title": "Refusing Legislation in The Quran Kufr?",
  "transcript": "another form of abandoning the quran is a more serious one is when you refuse to accept the quran to be the ultimate source of legislation in your life and you think that the verses are not certain they are probable and that the wordings do not confirm what is meant and that it might be ambiguous in a way which leads you to refusing making it the main source of legislation and something that you go and seek guidance from in the main principles of islam and also in the minor principles of islam you tell me how many quote unquote muslims people with the name of muhammad or ahmed or abdullah who reject the quran totally or partially the muslims so many don't be deceived by their names or by their nationality or by their languages they claim to be muslims but they're not they reject quran as a whole or portions of it because it does not go side by side with their democracy it does not go side by side with human rights or with their sick minds so"
