  "transcript": "So of course in the interview since I I'm a D I wanted my wife to be a D so that my children can be D. I wanted a wife mainly in dinen. You can't get a a woman in din. Where can you get beauty and wealth and everything but alhamdulillah Allah gave me a life partner who was a dai. She was the president of one of the local organizations in Punea. Alhamdulillah, she's very beautiful also. I'm happy. And the first girl married. Here starts the planning of the children. And after we got married, I'm just cutting the story short. We traveled a lot for giving lectures. I used to give lectures, she used to give lecture. We traveled in many countries all over the world. After we got married for the next six, seven years we traveled a lot to America, to South Africa, then to Australia, to Gulf countries, many countries. And while we were traveling for Dava, we did a little bit of tourism also. We saw to it that we visited the Islamic schools available at that time. I'm talking about the mid '90s and the late '9s. That is about 35 to 40 years before. 40 years before. And when we visited the schools, we saw that in the school their main purpose was we want to see to it that the girls that come to study, they should be allowed to wear hijab. The children that study in the school, they should be able to offer salah during the school timing when and we went into the school it's mentioned as the objective went to Australia what is the objective an environment in which there is no alcohol an environment which is drug-free and I traveled to across to various schools and I thought if this is the main purpose what they're calling Islamic school that can wear hijab, they can pray, no alcohol, no drug. In India where I come from, this is common. Every Muslim man is school, a Muslim is allowed to pray. The girl is allowed to wear hijab. Of course, there's no alcohol. Of course, there is no drug. So, I called the schools as Muslim manage school. Alhamdulillah, living in Australia and America, having such an environment is good. So I'm not criticizing them that way. But this is not what I wanted in Islamic school. Good what they having. Alhamdulillah. May Allah reward them. At least they're giving this sort of atmosphere in a non-Muslim environment. Good. But in India it's common. India because there's a Muslim person in law though it's a non-Muslim country. At the time Muslims ruled India. India is one of the few non-Muslim countries where a person can practice his full Sharia. Mashallah. So it was nothing unique for me. Most of the Muslim managed schools in India were like that. So what is unique for them? Okay, it may be unique. So when I say an Islamic school, I mean education for both the worlds and some of the schools we went to the best of schools in South Africa. I'm talking all this in the late '90s. Now the whole scenario has changed. Now in the last 25 years or 30 years the things have changed. At that time I went to the best school in South Africa. I won't take the name. And I spoke to the principal he said you know what the other private schools charge we charge half. I said why? Otherwise Muslims don't come to our school. So to attract the Muslim they kept the fees half of the private schools. Then the principal was telling that though we are supposed to be the best school in the country I won't take the name of that school. Once on a Saturday night I go to a fista hotel and I'm shocked to see the girls of my school in the ninth standard 10th standard 14 years old 15 years old. They are wearing many skirts and going in the dance club. Imagine studying in Islamic school 14 year old girl 15 year old girl in the ninth in the eth standard wearing miniskirts and going in a nuns club when the school starts after a couple of days on Monday the principal calls the parent and tells I saw your daughter so the parent says so what's the problem so what is the problem if you saw and they started threatening that if you don't like it we'll remove your child we'll remove our child from the school that means the management is at the mercy of the parents the situation is so bad that the management is at the mercy of the parents and this was the situation of the best Islamic schools at That time."
