  "title": "Does the dead body feel or hear anything right before he is buried? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sheikh bilal says after a person dies and before he's buried of course we take him to his house we strip him of his clothes we wash him we clean him we shroud him then we take him to the Masjid then we carry him to the Graveyard through this process does he feel so he knows that we're stripping him off that we're washing him the water is whoa cold his heart does he hear what we say when he Stroud him we have no evidence to prove that on the contrary the evidences that we have state that a deceased or a corpse does not hear a thing after it dies until those who took it to its burial place leave the cemetery so the moment they put him in his grave and they put the soil on top of his grave he hears the flip-flop of those mourners who came and buried him as they're walking out this is when he regains consciousness this is only evidence we have in Allah knows best"
