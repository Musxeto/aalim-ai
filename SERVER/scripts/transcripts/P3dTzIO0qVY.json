  "transcript": "Abid from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, how are you? Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I'd like to know, for a layman, if he only follows one Sheikh who is trustworthy, will he be sufficeable for every of his ibadah? For example, I follow you because I trust you, will I be exempted from everything if I follow you? If you follow someone who you trust in his knowledge, in his moral conduct, in his righteousness and piety, believing that he would be your imam, and you as you've described, you are a layman who does not have the means and tools to differentiate between what's right and wrong, between Qur'an and Sunnah, between things that are according to the Sunnah or not. If you follow such a person, you will be saved on the day of judgment because Allah Azza Wa Jal ordered you in the Qur'an twice to ask the people of knowledge of dhikr, فَاسْأَلُوا أَهْلَ الذِّكْرِ إِن كُنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ And when people don't know, they need people of guidance to guide them. So if you follow the right one whom you think and believe to the best of your ability that they are qualified to do this, Allah Azza Wa Jal would not hold you accountable in all things insha'Allah."
