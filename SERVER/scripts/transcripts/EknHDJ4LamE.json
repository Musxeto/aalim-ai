  "transcript": "ashra from India Alum can you hear me yeah barely yes okay so in India there are many dgas and my family practices dgas frequently so sometimes they force me to come along with them and sometimes they also force me to do this mean the DGA practices and the Imam also supports the DGA practice of my local area so what should I do should I practice with them or should I argue and not what is meant by D ashra Dara means like a human grave it's like a grave okay what do the people do in this grave they just go and like put their heads on the grave and like the peacock feathers they just rub it on their head and stuff so is this considered to be shik or not sir I exactly don't know but how don't you know how do do you not know when they go to a grave and place their head on the grave and send their messages and write uh requests and ask for forgiveness or ask for a child for those who don't have children or ask for protection from the uh debtors and and the likes what can be more shik than this when they sacrifice and offer to this DGA or send flowers or light candles this is plain shik so the they are practicing shik going with them would be something that nullifies your Islam"
