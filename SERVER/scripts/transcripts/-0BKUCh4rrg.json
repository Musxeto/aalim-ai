  "transcript": "We have Affan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, I have a question. It is like if we eat garlic or raw onions, does it break wudu? Okay. First of all, eating garlic and onions is permissible in Islam. It is something that Allah made halal for us to consume. It has many benefits. The only thing we have to pay attention we are prohibited from attending the prayer in the masjid. This is the only thing that is related to garlics and onions and the likes. are identified in the books of fiqh and are probably limited to five things. And this is the most authentic. Whether you pass wind, urine, or defecate, or you sleep, or eat camel's meat, these are the things that break your wudu. And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
