  "title": "Dealing with an Apostate Teacher & I have to be nice to him?",
  "transcript": "Malik from the U.S. Malik. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. So, I have a teacher. He's an apostate. He left Islam and he's trying to build this relationship with me. It's kind of friend-like and I know that we're supposed to avoid confrontation with apostates. What do you advise me to do to avoid talking to him? And he's your teacher at school? Yes, he is. Okay, he's your teacher at school and it's inevitable for you to communicate with him or he will flunk you. So, we have a saying in Arabic, if you have something you need from a dog, you say to that dog, yes master. Of course, the dog is relating to the animal, not what you guys say in America, he's my dog. No, no, the actual dog. So, this shows that at times of necessity and need, there's nothing you can do. He's your teacher. You have to be diplomatic, though you resent and hate whatever he does because of his kufr and apostasy. So, try to be diplomatic, keep your distance, but don't shun him off completely until you pass his subject and then wash him down the drain if you wish. Thank you."
