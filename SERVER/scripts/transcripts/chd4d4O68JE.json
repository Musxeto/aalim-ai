  "transcript": "Abduh from the U.S. Sorry Sheikh to go back on the original topic. Because I heard in the Quran I think Allah says when you like hear those who like mock the verses of Allah, like not say with them because that would make you like them. So like I was just wondering would that make us like, would that be like a state of kuffar? This ayah is ayah number 140, chapter 4, Surah An-Nisa. And the tafseer of the ayah, the most authentic opinion is that it does not make a person a kafir. It makes him as sinful as they are. Innakum idhan mithluhum in their sin. Not in their disbelief. Not in leaving the fold of Islam unless you believe in it. And this is very important because it opens the door for wiswas and OCD in your own Islam. So the most authentic opinion is that innakum idhan mithluhum you are then like them in their sin not in their kuffar. So I hope this answers your question. you"
