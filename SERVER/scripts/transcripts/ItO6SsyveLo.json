  "transcript": "Can I have two more questions? Sure. Because this is a very global question. No problem. Sheikh, people say, I mean the non-Muslims say, Islam spread by the sword. Tell us Sheikh. So what? And show me one country, one nation, whether the Romans, the Byzantines, the Persians, the Greek, anyone who came peacefully, knocked on people's doors and gave them flowers. Everywhere in the whole world, they've been fighting and engaging in wars. But look at the wars that the Muslim had with other countries, with other nations, and the prosperity they gave to these people. Look at the amount of people coming willingly, without a sword, without any compulsion, accepting Islam, and compare this to any other religion, to any other denomination, to any other nation on earth, and you will find that this is not entirely true. Were there wars? Of course. Islam had to have offensive war and defensive war. Defensive when they attacked us, but offensive when they prevented the religion from spreading, and we gave them the choices between accepting Islam, or paying taxation, or facing the possibility of going to war. But to say, no, no, no, no, Islam was not spread by the sword, this is not true. And to say, no, Islam is a violent religion, it was forcing people to come to Islam, this is a lie. No one on earth is forced to accept Islam. Even when we conquer your country, you want to accept Islam? No. Okay, remain on your religion. We don't kill you. We don't have to do things to you that would force you to accept Islam. You have the freedom of religion. Sheikh, if they say Islam spread by the sword, how come in the Quran there is no word sword? Is that true? No, it's not true. The word sword, it is mentioned, but at the same time, what is meant by it is mentioned, which is to fight. To fight the people until they accept the religion, or to pay taxation, and this is clearly mentioned in chapter 9. So you have to fight them until they give the taxation. Okay. Now, having said that, it is important to know and to acknowledge that the issue of fighting is everywhere. Okay. Not only in Islam. Yes. In all religions. Look what America did in Iraq and Afghanistan. Did they give them roses? No. They gave them guns. Yes, they gave them chocolates. And then, that's why we have guns and roses. Yes, guns and roses. They kept the roses and they gave them the guns. And they've killed millions. Yes. So this is recently. Where is democracy? Where is peace? Nobody looks or talks about it. Just they turn a blind eye. Oh, they had weapons of mass destruction. And after 20 years, oops, sorry, we were wrong. But after what? In Islam, when we conquer a country, of course, there's nothing peaceful about it. But look at the amount of Muslims coming in to Islam. They are in the thousands, in the hundreds of thousands, in the millions. Who's forcing them? Look at Indonesia, for example. Show me one single bullet that was fired or one single sword that was raised. None. 250 million Muslims. How? By voodoo, by magic, by black sorcery, or by intellect. People with intellect looked into the religion and found that this is the right religion and accepted Islam. Yes. Alhamdulillah."
