  "transcript": "what is the role of remorse in accept accepting the repentance it is a major role without remorse your repentance is not accepted so if a person apostatized and he went or came back to islam he doesn't require remorse because he was a kafir all what he requires is to embrace islam and start fresh and all these years that have passed him without the remorse they are not counted but if he committed a sin he's been fornicating for a couple of years and now he repented and now he's married and he's happily married he goes to work but he doesn't find the remorse over the two years of fornication his repentance is not accepted in the sense that he will be held accountable for it until he gets this burning feeling in his heart the fear of allah and of his torment over that heinous sins that he had committed if he cannot find it i feel sorry for him and he'll feel sorry later on down the line he has to plant it he has to fake it until it becomes real and allah azza knows best"
