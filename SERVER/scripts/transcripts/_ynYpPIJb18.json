  "title": "What does Islam say about FORCING Women to Wear Hijab or Niqab? Isn’t it shirk?",
  "transcript": ".says, can a husband or a Muslim \nruler force women to wear hijab   or burqa or (niqāb)? Isn't this shirk if she \nwears it for them and not for Allah Azza wa Jal?  This question often arises because \nof the whispers of Shayṭān.   Whenever there's something good, Shayṭān tries \nto block it, in our minds, in our communities.   Now, the things that a husband, who is a \nperson of authority over his wife and children,   whether they like it or not, this is Islām, \nthis is sharī'ah law. You cannot fight this.   You cannot simply say 'Oh, we will not implement \nthis anymore'. This is religion. This is part of   our conviction and belief. You can not just - \nwith a pen - scratch it off and say 'No more'.   It is mentioned in the Qur'ān. الرِّجَالُ \nقَوَّامُونَ [An-Nisa 4:34] Men are guardian   and responsible and have authority over women. And \nthe Muslim ruler has authority over his subjects.  And Allah ordered us to obey Allah and to obey \nthe Prophet ﷺ and those of authority among us.  أَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ \nوَأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ [An-Nisa 4:59].   So, now when we come to a man and his \nwife. If the wife is ordered by her husband   to change things that her conviction \nis mandatory to do, or prohibited   to do, in her conviction, she must not obey \nher husband. So it's an issue of dispute.  If the woman says 'I believe that it is mandatory \nupon me to give zakāt on my gold and silver   jewelleries. And the husbands conviction is that \n'No, as long as you wear it, it's not mandatory',   as a lot of the schools of thought say. So he \nprohibits his wife from giving zakāt on her   own jewelry. In this case we say, 'You must not \nobey him. You must disobey him', because you're   obeying Allah Azza wa Jal. And this is none of \nhis rights to intervene in. This is your wealth,   this is your money, if you want to invest it, he \nhas no right to stop you because it's your wealth.  So in such cases for example, if you believe that \nyou have to put the right over the left on your   chest and he says 'No, you have to put them \non your side', or '-below your belly button',   '-below your navel'. You are not obliged to obey \nhim. Because this is not related to his rights.  So whatever is related to his rights \nyou have to obey him. Such as,   he orders you not to go and visit your sick \nmother. It is his God-given right not to   leave the house without his permission. He's \nsinful, he's wrong, Allah will punish him, but   obeying him is mandatory - visiting your \nsick mother is not. So try to be kind and   nice to him and try to be diplomatic and get \nhim to approve. Otherwise, you must not go.  Likewise, if he prohibits you from \nfasting voluntarily Mondays and Thursdays,   the Prophet ﷺ told us that this is his right. It \nis related to his (husbands) rights. So you have   to obey him and not fast voluntary fasting without \nhis permission. Likewise, if a woman wants to go   to make 'Umrah which is voluntary, or perform Hajj \nwhich is voluntary, it is prohibited for her to   do so without his permission. This is related to \nhis rights. Now when we come to niqāb, or hijāb,   or burqa it's the same thing. Even if she doesn't \nbelieve that covering the face is mandatory,  no scholar on earth says that covering it is \nprohibited. They all say it's recommended,   or permissible. The least.\nNo one says it's prohibited. So because it is not   a prohibited thing, or he's not ordering you to \ndo an innovation. Rather, it saves his own honor   and reputation. Because without any doubt, when a \nman's wife goes uncovered he is ashamed of that.   So it is a must upon a woman to obey her husband \nif he tells her to cover her face. Even if   she does not believe it's mandatory, yet it is \nobligatory upon her to obey him. And likewise,   it's the duty of the Muslim ruler to enforce \nsharī'ah, to implement sharī'ah because Allah Azza   wa Jal put him in that position to do so. To rule \nwith what Allah has revealed in the Qur'ān and the   Prophet taught us, 'aleyhi salatu wa salam. To \nrefrain from doing this and allow people to do   whatever they want and allow sins to be widely \nspread, he is accountable and sinful for that."
