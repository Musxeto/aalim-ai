  "transcript": "sua from the ukam Alum so oh I know that um women when they are on their mes they're not supposed to go to the m um but what if um the m has a school side and they teach children there they have classrooms but the Masid and the school is in like in one building and then but then sometimes inter for example when the M this fool in the prayer Halls they open the School site and some people pray there so can a woman work in the school side full time even when she's on her menis whatever is considered to be part of the Masjid a woman must not enter it while she's in her mensis however we know that the Masjid of Medina was surrounded by the house of the Prophet so he had nine homes adjacent and attached to the Masjid but it was not part of the Masjid though it was in the same construction so if this school is segregated from the Masjid in the sense that people go in and out as a school as in some masjids you would have the house of the IM and of the muin on top of the Masjid or adjacent to it and that would not be considered part of the Masjid so if this school is segregated from the Masjid where people go in and out and treat it as a Masjid there's no problem inshallah even when the Masjid is to completely full and they open this school so that people would have space to pray in it this doesn't make it part of the Masjid as in the case when we pray on the streets outside of the Masjid when the Masjid is totally full this doesn't make the streets part of the Masjid so I hope yeah this is permissible and Allah Knows Best"
