  "transcript": "Azad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I remembered that I had stolen a candy from a grocery store more than a decade ago when I was like six or seven years old and the owner to this day doesn't know about it and the store and the owner is still present till today. If I give the money back to the cash register saying that we'll get an x amount from me as it's common for me to have deals with them and they gladly receives it without knowing that I'm returning the lost item in cash equal to the item that I've stolen. Also making sure the owner doesn't know about this to conceal my sin. Will this suffice it while also repenting to Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala? JazakAllahu Khairan. Yes, the answer is that would suffice. If you return the value of the stolen item to the lawful owner without telling them, this is sufficient inshaAllah."
