  "title": "Sheikh goes OFF on Anime Watchers!!!",
  "transcript": "I don't know what animes you watch. Shake I don't watch enemies. Come on. You said that that video that went viral. You talking about it? You spoke like you've watched a lot of anime in your life. Never in my life. What? You know you're talking about that viral without you. Naruto nar. No. No. What are you talking about? Anime a bunch of crap. It's all the same thing. It was so funny. It makes a good point, man. Anime for anime for that clip. I said I said I said that clip to all my brothers. I'm a person. And I don't watch these stuff. I don't watch any of that. But but when I talk, I try my little best to make people feel what I'm talking about. And that I have some idea. So, are you tired of pretending that anime matters? That you care? I like anime. I love anime. I'm not going to lie. Well, that you said it made me laugh. I'm not going to lie. How long you been Muslim? My whole life. Okay. So what's your take on Islam? It's a beautiful religion. Okay. The truth. What is it? The truth. It's truth. So if you don't walk the talk, what good the truth is to you. So the borderline is if you praying to in the masid and you get whispers that, oh they're looking at me. I'm praying so that I can get their praise and compliment. You have two choices on the table. Either to break a prayer or to continue. Logical. Is there a third option? No. You tell me. Not that I don't know. Okay. If you break your prayer, Shayan, Satan, Lucifer, El is pleased because you obeyed him. Correct. Yeah. But Allah is angry because you broke your prayer. But if you continue to pray, shanan is pissed because you disobeyed him and his strategy did not work. Allah is pleased because you worshiping him. It boils down to two things. Either you obey Allah or obey Shaitan. Now you tell me watching anime. Okay. You tell me. Sne anime too. I don't know. I hate anime. I'm so glad I got to meet a guy here. Judgment, you're going to stand alone. But Naruto, Naruto, he's inspiring. Honestly, I did not ask you about him. I don't not ask you about his seven lives or or or the demons he's into. I'm just asking you, does it please Allah or please shar? Simple as that. Very simple question. Don't beat around the bush. He's not going to save you in your grave. I'm not going to do anything to you on the day of judgment. I'm going to bail out for myself, man. It's my skin. So, this is how we roll in Islam. It's not what the people say. It's not what my followers dictate that I should do."
