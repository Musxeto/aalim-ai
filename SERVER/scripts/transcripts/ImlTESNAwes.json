  "transcript": "Isma from France. Hello. Hello. Yes. Do you hear me? I don't understand what you're saying Isma. Do you hear me? Do I see you? Can you hear me Sheikh? Oh no, I cannot hear you. I can hear you but I cannot see you. What's your question? I have a problem with incontinence and basically yesterday it didn't stop or it was irregular and I didn't know when to pray so I prayed when I wanted. But the thing is that before the end of prayer it's been like 10 minutes and it seems to stop. So my question is do I have to repeat my prayer or not? Okay, first of all, wind incontinence is of two types. Either the type that is continuous and it's causing a lot of hardship for you to perform wudu and then break, perform wudu and pray and break because of it being continuous. In this case, you have to perform wudu only after the time of the prayer is due and while doing wudu if something comes out, while praying if something comes out, this has no impact on your wudu or your prayer till the end of time. The second type of wind incontinence is the type that comes at a specific time but then you know for certain that there would be a time where there would be enough gap for you to perform wudu and pray without anything coming out. In this case, you have to wait. The problem is that if you are in between, you don't know. This is something between you and Allah. If you are always considered to have this coming to you and you have a lot of hardship because it doesn't usually stop and you prayed at the beginning of the time and it so happens that at the end of the time, it stopped. Not as usual. This is irregular. Usually it doesn't stop, then your prayer is valid inshaAllah without a problem. You're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
