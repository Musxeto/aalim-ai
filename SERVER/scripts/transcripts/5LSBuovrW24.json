  "title": "Timings for Suhoor and Iftar differ for Umm Al Qura & Masjid Athaan, what should I follow, app or ma",
  "transcript": "when i see them using uml core timings what if the timings of the local masjid are like one or two or five or ten minutes earlier or later than the uml quran timing what should i follow okay i will answer in charlotte paisan from india he says we know that you always promote um calculation for determining the prayer times globally and you say that it is the most accurate calculations with the exception of isha prayer because this was a mistake a huge mistake and it has to be changed but who's listening to fix risha to be one hour and a half throughout the whole year after sunset is definitely wrong and there's no excuse for it none whatsoever especially when lots of the women would delay their maghrib thinking that it's still time because aisha did not was not called for yet there's an hour and a half not knowing that the redness in the twilight disappears after maybe 65 70 minutes not 90 minutes which means that they will be praying maghrib after the time was over so um faizan says what happens when in fajr or in maghrib sunset the because we live in bangladesh or in india so we can hear the adhan from the masjid what happens if it's earlier or later than um by few minutes has ordered you as an individual not to break your fast until the sun sets and not to refrain from eating and drink drinking until the true dawn breaks if you are unable to see this personally in this case in islam you're instructed depend to depend on the then not on your muslim app or finder islam finder whatever they call them or on the calendar you depend on the fin and he takes the blame for being late or being early so this is what you're supposed to follow you"
