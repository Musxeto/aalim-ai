  "title": "Went to Saudi Arabia with intention to work from Philippines , is my Hajj or Umrah invalid?",
  "transcript": "Sada from the Philippines. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah. And you are? I am Sada from the Philippines. What can I do for you? My question Sheikh is regarding hajj. Like for example, if one is working in Saudi, let's say she or he flies from the Philippines going to Saudi with intention to work and then he or she gets the opportunity to perform the hajj within the work contract. Sheikh, some people here in my country say that such hajj is not valid because initially the intention is to work and not to perform the hajj. I would like to ask if such opinion is valid? Thank you. What the people say is totally bogus and without knowledge. Allah Azza Wa Jal gave the permission to the companions to trade while they are away for hajj. When he said, laisa alaykum junahun an tabataghu fadlan min rabbikum. There is no burden upon you for you if you were to seek Allah's favours while performing hajj. Meaning that some of the companions felt like the ignorant people in your country who are saying that you can't go to work on a visa to work and at the same time make a condition to perform hajj. No, you can't. It's not valid. No, no. Some companions felt this. So Allah relieved them from such a burden and said there's no problem at all. So there is no problem in performing hajj if it's in your contract and the conditions are fulfilled. It's a valid hajj. May Allah accept."
