  "title": "Does a low bun count as camel hump hijab? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "amina says do low buns also count as camel humps because women with long hair find it more convenient to tie up their hair under the hijab in a low bun rather than let it in a long braid it's best to be braided because this conceals your head and no one knows how long your hair is nevertheless a camel's hump is when you have it on top of your head but to have it at the back of the head on your uh neck inshallah this is not the camel's hump but again people would know how long your head is by the size so i would not recommend this but i would not even go to the extent to say that this is a camel's hump description which is prohibited you"
