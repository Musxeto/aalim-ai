  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Singapore This time around my question will be with \nregards to crying is prayer see if I'm I   I'm performing my my Maghreb in uh in the in \nmy last rakaa in my last sujood I poured all   my feelings to Allah and I cried so thereafter \nis my wudu still valid uh for my for my Isha   okay I will answer you inshallah \nas for Aisha's question in a nutshell crying in prayer or outside \nthe prayer has no impact on your wudu at all   I don't know where you got the idea that it \nimpacts your wudu so you're asking whether my   ishaa is valid if I pray with the same wudu \nthe things that nullify wudu are limited   we can't bring things and add to \nthem so you pass wind you urinate   you defecate and whatever comes from \nyour private part nullifies your wudu   sleeping nullify your wudu and eating camel's \nmeat nullifies your wudu are the most authentic   nullifiers of your ablution your wudu so you \ncan't pray afterwards you have to renew your wudu   now smoking looking at the opposite gender \nlustfully crying and looking at yourself naked   in the mirror as so many people think all \nof these things have no impact on your Wudu"
