  "transcript": "um tamu says that in the uk it's rare that you would find a place in the open to conduct it's a lot so if there aren't any open plazas for us or it was raining or it was anything of the sort and there is only the masjid to perform it can we perform it in the masjid the answer is yes there is nothing wrong in that it's against the sunnah but the prayer is valid inshallah and it's better than not praying"
