  "transcript": "Adeeb from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, born in a Muslim family and now kind of agnostic theist who believes in a God but not sure whether Allah is that God or not. He studies about Islam and other religions for many many years, offers Salah five times in a day and fasting and other good deeds, knowing that all these are rewardless but hoping that Allah might not seal but open his heart. Is there any other things he can do to ask Allah for Hidayah? This person needs counselling. He needs to sit with a Muslim psychiatrist who knows Islam or with a Muslim counsellor who would sit and open his eyes to the truth because it is not possible for someone to be agnostic and praise five times a day and read the Qur'an and fearful of Allah that he would throw him in hell and still is on shaky grounds. This is not logical. Either he is a full-fledged hypocrite, deceiving people and himself and pretending to be a Muslim, which is a little bit difficult, or his head is messed up big time by shaitan, trying to infiltrate it, trying to insert these whispers convincing him that no no no you're not convinced, maybe there is another religion, maybe there's another god. And this or these are whispers of shaitan he must ignore, avoid and in my opinion he has to cement his Iman. And how to do this? It is by going through Allah's beautiful names and attributes, studying them and enforcing and cementing the belief in Allah Azza wa Jal, reading about the Day of Judgment, reading about the messengers, trying to build up his Iman, so that it would counter such whispers with the grace of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala."
