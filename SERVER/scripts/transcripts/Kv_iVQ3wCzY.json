  "transcript": "tahit is divided into three types the heed of lordship meaning who's the lord of the universe it is allah azzawajal what do we mean by him being the lord it means that he creates no one other than him creates he gives life and death he gives sustenance he provides for us he runs everything with his command and no one else can does this he has sovereignty over the whole universe he owns everything this is worshipping allah azzawajal through his actions subhanallah allah says in the quran say who provides for you from the sky and from the earth even the disbelievers the idol worshipers would say allah no one says buddha or my cow they would all say allah or who owns hearing and sight and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living and who disposes the affairs they will say allah say will you not then be afraid of allah's punishment this tawheed even the idol worshipers did not differ in they acknowledged this they acknowledge that it's only allah that gives life and death everybody acknowledges this and knows that allah is the creator the sustainer the provider the one who makes the rainfall the one who grows the plants and give sustenance to everything the one who runs everything everybody knows this what about atheist sheikh even atheists allah says in the quran that they may reject it but deep down they know it and they know it even the atheist when their plane is about to crash they would shout oh allah help us if it lands safely no i would i it wasn't me someone else said that they reject this but they know when they're sick about to die they know when in danger when in need they know and if they come to know and don't want to confess boom they just commit suicide and they'll go to hell straightforward no other way this is the hedo ar the head of lordship the heat of worship is known as and this is what the messengers were sent for this is where the beef between the believers and the disbelievers lie why or of worship is to worship only allah to devote all of our forms of worship specifically and to limit it to allah azza such as things that are done by the heart the fear the love the hope the dependence the uh and and the rest of that things that are done physically as prayer fasting sacrifice performing hajj and umrah etc things are done by the tongue saying vicar always remembering allah azzawajal saying oaths by allah this is meaning that i devote all of my forms of worship only and solely to allah the almighty this is where the dispute took place between the messengers and their people their people said whoa wait wait wait hold your horses do you want us only to invoke one god do you want us only to worship one god what about these gods we have no this is something that we cannot accept allah says in the quran and we did not send any messenger before you o muhammad but we inspired him saying none has the right to be worshipped but i allah so worship me alone and none else this is what the prophet was sent and all messengers were sent with it's the same identical message there is no one worthy of being worshipped except allah no holy spirit no messenger no angel no statue no rock no tree no building no sun no planet nothing the only one where we devote our worship to is allah the almighty subhanahu azzawajal the third type of tawheed is the the beautiful names and attributes of allah and this we will hopefully postpone till tomorrow alongside with the importance of tahiti in our lives and we shall discuss that and elaborate upon isha allah"
