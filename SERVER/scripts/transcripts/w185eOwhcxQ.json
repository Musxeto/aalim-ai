  "title": "Why do we do the Qunoot AFTER rising from Ruku? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Our man from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I had a question about Qunoot in Wittur. So you say we have to do it after the Rukuh and it is fine if we do it before too, but in Sahih Al-Bukhari I read a hadith where Anas Ibn Malik said that it should be before and not after. So why do we do it after the Rukuh? Because it was reported that it was done after the Rukuh. What's the problem in that? Anas Ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, if this hadith, as you've reported, is regarding the Qunoot, which is the Du'a, it did not say that it can't be after the Rukuh. As in the hadith of Hasan Ibn Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, when he came to his grandfather ï·º and asked him about the Du'a in Qunoot, he told him to say, and the vast majority of scholars say that this is after the Rukuh. The Qunoot is also referring to the length of standing and reciting the Qur'an. So this may be also understood from the hadith of Anas, that before the Rukuh, the sunnah is to prolong your standing in reciting the Qur'an, especially in Fajr, because this is a blessed time and this is part of the sunnah, and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
