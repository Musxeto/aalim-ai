  "transcript": "sharen from India Shireen shum uh my father is looking for a spouse for me and we have faced so many rejections in the past two years recently there came a person with all the qualities we look for and from a good family he seemed to be the person to whom I prayed for and then it was actually easy for me to lower my case and limiting my interactions with non Maham but everything suddenly got vanished I don't know what went wrong I don't understand I thought Allah was answering my Dua but now it's it went back I don't know whether it is a test or anything wrong from our side have we missed the person that Allah gave us I'm so confused how old are you I'm 23 you're still a kid you're still at the marrying age and if Allah took this sutor away from you maybe you were not suitable for him and maybe there are things in him that you don't see that Allah has protected you from by making this U uh proposal break down so always think positive think positively and accept with content whatever Allah has decreed upon you this man is not the last man on Earth and alhamdulillah you're still 23 years of age you're still young and there will come better proposals for you inshallah that would make you forget everything that went by and Allah Knows Best"
