  "transcript": "brother Hamza from Bosnia my question is about wiping over socks we know that a resident can wipe for 24 hours so sometimes it happens that I'm about to take Pudu and I have no clue when my first wiping was let's say for example it is Isha time right now and I'm taking Voodoo and I can't remember whether my first wiping was in Maghrib or Isha time yesterday what should I do in this case would it be allowed to wipe over my socks one more time because I have no evidence that I exceeded 24 hours or do I have to take off my socks and wash my feet normally to play safe barakala figures it is as mentioned in the Hadith wiping for a resident for a whole day and a whole night which is 24 hours which means that if you're not certain because this is not the default wiping is an exemption or is a concession let's say from Allah azzawajal therefore it's not the default so if your doubtful whether it's Asia time take your socks off and wash your feet because you cannot exceed the time limit set by the prophet Allah which is for 24 hours hence if you're doubtful whether it's 24 or more no you have to take it off and wash your feet and Allah Knows Best foreign"
