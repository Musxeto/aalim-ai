  "title": "Fasting the 9th of Dhul Hijjah (Arafah): Follow Saudi Arabia or Local Moon Sighting? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "like people who are not residing in saudi arabia do they have to pass on the ninth of the uh of saudi arabia okay because like you know they just want to know uh whether we will leave yeah we will miss the virtues of fasting on the day of arafah what is the ruling actually i just wanted okay now the confusion lies because the day of arafah is associated with hajj so the season of hajj does not happen in america or in japan it happens only in one specific area and on that area the ninth of the hijra is friday for example so what to do to the people in the u.s and to the people of japan when they want to fast the ninth of the hija i don't understand you see the ninth of the hija in mecca in arafat is on a friday but according to the moon sighting in these countries the u.s or in japan their ninth of hija according to their moon sighting according to their hijra calendar might be on a thursday or on a saturday other than the day in arafat actually so which day should they fast they must not abide by friday which is in makkah region they must abide by their hijri calendar because their ninth of the hija is on a thursday or on a saturday according to their moon sighting and if they fast their night of ninth of the hija they will attain the expiation and the forgiveness and the erasing of the sins of two years but if they don't fast the eighth of the hijab for example if friday coincides with them to be eat so what is it they're going to do change the whole calendar no they have to abide by their moon sighting and i hope this answers your question you"
