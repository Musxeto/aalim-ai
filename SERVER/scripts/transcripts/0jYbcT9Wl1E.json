  "title": "If I get a job with a false certificate are my earnings be haram? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "is a question from sister Samira she says if I get a job with false certificate will my salary be Haram first of all we have to know that Islam totally prohibits cheating and lying and these are major sins they're not something to be taken lightly especially when it comes to such issues such as applying for a job or proposing to a woman for marriage and you lie or you cheat or you pretend something that you're not all of these are major sins and prohibited now when it comes to applying for a job there is a difference between a person who had cheated in a subject or two and a person who forged a certificate or a degree in the latter case if a person has a forged false certificate or degree all of his income is totally prohibited in Haarlem and he must quit the job he must look for a job with his actual and true qualification so if he forged a BS or a BA in whatever he has to apply with his high-school certificate because his university degree is invalid it is forged it is a lie then what about if someone cheated in one of the subjects which is part of his certificate part of his degree this as the scholars say is considered to be a sin a major sin but it does not affect the job and it does not affect the whole of the certificate because the vast majority of the subjects were passed legitimately yet one or two subject he fell weak and cheated in them what counts when applying for a job is whether you fit the job description and you're qualified to take the tasks given to you and the vast majority of people would probably have cheated a little bit here or there or helped in a subject here or there so to come and say all of you your income is Haram and you have to quit the job this would be too difficult for the vast majority of Muslims unlike those who forged their degree this is totally baseless for them and this is a pre-requisite of the job that you have this certificate which is forged and not real therefore if you have a false certificate that is totally forged that is made-up then the income would be Haram"
