  "title": "Reminding others of One's Favors for them, are they Mannaan (those who will not enter Jannah)?",
  "transcript": "faizan from india uh so shift my question is some people say stuff like i did so much for you i did xyz for you and you don't even do this one thing for me does such statement come under the ruling of manan that the manan will not enter jannah now what is the terminology of al-mannan al-manan is one of allah's beautiful names and it has two meanings when it comes to allah's names one the one who gives because al-men is to give femnun awimsik either give or withhold so allah is the man he gives his creations their provisions the other meaning of him and nan is the one who reminds others of his gifts and both meanings in allah's side is names of majestic and praise and beauty because no one in this universe has the right to boast about what he gave to others except allah azza and he's worthy of that now in our case as humans the prophet said alas does not will not enter jannah the one who reminds others of what they had done for them and this happens a lot when we feel ingratitude coming to us so we tell people whom we've helped in the past didn't i lend you money didn't i help you find a job didn't i give you didn't i host you didn't i uh introduced you to your boss who gave you this and that and this attribute is a wicked attribute in a human being because you are peers you are alike so it is prohibited for you to do such a thing and yes it is a major sin you"
