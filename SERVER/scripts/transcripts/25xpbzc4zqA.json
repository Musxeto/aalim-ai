  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Attending the ceremony here brings out the third type of fear you mentioned just now by having a whip at the back So my question is are we allowed to lie about our good deeds or Ibadah in order to protect ourselves from being a Riyadh or something like this Because in the Riyadh Muslim, Ibn Shihab said he never witnessed Rasulullah allowed to lie other than the three situations Which is in war or to bring peace or between wife and husband So are we allowed to lie to someone saying no no no I'm not fasting today just I don't want to eat What opinion? Thank you Sheikh The Hadith is authentic but I don't know if it's by Ibn Shihab because I don't know who the narrator is The Hadith is authentic It is not permissible to lie except in three situations So these situations are in war, number two when reconciling between two fighting individuals or factions To reconcile between them Number three, a spouse lying to his or her spouse in things that would increase the love between them So your wife says am I beautiful? You get a smack on your face and you will not be able to see for five days until the swollen is gone I tried this so many times so don't try it at home She says am I beautiful? Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar I don't know when you ask me this question she comes to you in a dress Am I beautiful? The dress is almost going to break because of her overweight But you say Wallahi I don't know Is the dress making you beautiful or you're making the dress beautiful This would give you six months pass You can do whatever you want You can do whatever you want So this kind of lying is halal But when you expand it Then you say ok can I lie when my father says did you pray in the masjid When my father says did you do your homework And you didn't Now here lying is haram So what to do The prophet said In Arabic means to camouflage your answer Not to straightly answer Someone says sheikh do you smoke or did you smoke And you say and you did smoke For example And you say Who in his right mind would smoke Finished Did I lie? I didn't Likewise the prophet when was asked Which tribe are you from He said first of all tell us how many were the army of Quraysh And the man told him Then he said ok now you answer my question Which tribe from Quraysh He says from water Water is the name of well The well of Kuala Lumpur, the well of Perlis, the well of this Meaning it's a location But the prophet meant that we are from water Meaning semen Like all humans are born from water So the prophet did not lie And he left So whenever you are asked something that you cannot answer Dodge the question Some people come to me and say Sheikh I proposed to a woman last week And I asked her if she was a virgin or not Or did she have a relationship or not What kind of a man is he? And I say to sisters who ask me this question A proposal came and the man asked me this What should I do? So kick him out Or at least let your father kick him out No reputable woman would accept such a question Even if she had a relationship Any woman who had a relationship She should conceal it between her and Allah Allah is most forgiving and most merciful Someone asks you, you don't answer So what do I do? You kick him out He is not worthy, this guy is a nutcase In 3-4 months you are going to come to me in counseling I know, I am going to get rich I am going to pay the down payment of my boat inshallah So no, avoid this totally Inshallah So lying brother is haram Now there are cases that may not be mentioned in the three But logic indicates that they should fall I am in my house Someone is running away from a kafir who wants to kill him Or from an oppressor And I know this guy is innocent Or at least he is a passerby He comes and hides in my house And the killer comes and says Is so and so in your house? Allah I don't lie, look at him I am killing him No, you have to lie in this to save a soul So this is higher, it is greater than the three mentioned And you have to do the math and Allah knows best Alright, thank you Al Fatiha"
