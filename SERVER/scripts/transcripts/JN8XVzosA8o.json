  "title": "Should I study medicine or Islamic studies knowing studying Islamic studies will not pay the bills?",
  "transcript": "muhammad from the philippines he's 18 years old he wants to study he's at a a crossroad should he study engineering or medicine to become a doctor or an engineer and earn money or should he apply to islamic universities in saudi arabia come and study six years or seven years and become a graduate of an islamic university not knowing will that put food on the table or not if you have this concept at the back of your mind i would clearly say to you go and study medic medicine don't come and study islamic studies because if you don't have the drive that would make you tolerate hardship if you're the kind of person that needs a certain standard of living then studying and teaching and working in islamic education is not your cup of tea it doesn't pay it fulfills your iman it gets you closer to allah but it doesn't allow you to buy a new car every three four years it doesn't allow you to invest and have money and give right left and center like worldly education does so it all depends on your drive on your conviction on your amount of patience and tolerance for the dean if you don't have it in it in you don't have high aspirations thinking that oh i'm gonna be a scholar i'm gonna without knowing that it's a difficult road to cross nevertheless you can combine and have both at the same time so you can do your medicine and you can apply to online universities where you will learn a little bit about islam on your terms of course unlike the focused and concentrated education you would get in saudi universities but at least you can combine between both and make a win-win [Music] inshallah you"
