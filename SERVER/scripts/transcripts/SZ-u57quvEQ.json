  "title": "Should I make Dua outside the Graveyard & face the Qibla? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The next question is, when I visit my father's grave, his grave is in the middle of the cemetery. So while walking towards it, I pass by other graves and I make dua by facing Qibla. Should I go to the grave to make dua or can I do it outside? No, you can do dua for anyone who's engraved, who is buried, whether he's your father or anyone else, without the need to face the Qibla. There is no need to face the Qibla, but if you do face the Qibla, make the grave between you and the Qibla, and you can raise your hands and make dua. So why do you want to make it outside? You're not praying Salat. Salat is not permissible to be prayed in a cemetery, in a graveyard. Salat that includes bowing and prostration, ruku and sujood, this is totally prohibited. But to pray in the dua, to invoke Allah, Allah forgive them, Allah have mercy on them, Allah expand their graves, this is permissible to be done as you're walking, and this is the dua we say. And so forth, no problem."
