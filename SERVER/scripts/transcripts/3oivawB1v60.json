  "title": "Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah Pronunciation? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Our first questioner is Sadiqa from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, I saw a video, Sheikh is teaching the sentence, Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah, and he said that if you join the Hu with Liman, it changes the meaning of the word. So if someone say Sami Allah, then pause, then say Hu Liman Hamidah, it changes the meaning. And he suggests to say it like this, Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah. But I always say like this, Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah. Now I'm having doubts and hesitate while praying. So Sheikh, I want to know which one is more better, Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah, this or Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah? It's all the same. They're both the same, but the first one is the most best way of saying it. Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah, Allah Hu Liman Hamidah. What the Sheikh was referring to, if I'm thinking the way he's thinking, is to separate Allah and Hu, which is a pronoun meaning He. So it would be Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah, He is for whomever praises Him. And this definitely changes the meaning. Nobody pauses here, nobody says Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah. Hu Liman Hamidah is definitely distorting the meaning and the salat is invalid. But to say what you say, Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah, or Sami Allah Hu Liman Hamidah, it's all the same. There's no problem in that inshallah."
