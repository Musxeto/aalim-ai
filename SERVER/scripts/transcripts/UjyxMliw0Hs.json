  "title": "Can she use vitamin C serum to remove brown spots or lighten her skin for a Skin Disorder?",
  "transcript": "Umm Hala from the U.S so basically I've seen a \npatient who is a patient of melasma which is a   skin disorder which you can get by UVB rays when \nit affects your skin so this patient basically has   uh brown spots on her on the corners of her lips \nthe problem is she applied a bleaching agent and   um which affected her surrounding skin as well \nnow what I want to recommend her and direct her   as practitioners recommend is something called \nvitamin C vitamin C is will not lighten her skin   to a dramatic level like Michael Jackson but it \nmight make her a skin tone lighter because when   if she will stop using that bleaching agent now \nwhat will happen is that melasma would return   after five six or three months and will return \neven darker so right now the melasma is in control   so if I give her vitamin C if she applies vitamin \nC um her skin that melasma would be in control and   it probably won't come back darker and generally \nI can ask her to use it just on that area but the   problem is that her skin her surrounding skin \nmight get pigmented so practitioners generally   generally recommend to use it on the entire \nentire face so my question is is this permissible   well this is a little bit too technical for me \nand might be way above my pay grade I have to   seriously look into it and consider all aspects \nof it and maybe consult some of the major Scholars   for opinion the standard fatwa is if there is \nI don't know if the right word is pigmentation   difference of color you can restore whatever was \npreviously there with medical treatment or surgery   if using vitamin C would fix this this is \npermissible now what you're saying is that   you have to treat the whole face to become \nlighter in color fairer in color so it's a   form of bleaching as well but what you're saying \nto me that it is not intended for the sake of   bleaching rather to keep the tone the same so \nthat there would not be any difference of color   and I have to look into how the bleaching is done \nwhat degree how fair would she become and if there   are any other Alternatives and to contemplate \nupon it so I would highly recommend and ask   if it's possible to post this question to my \nwebsite so that I can think about it insha-Allah"
