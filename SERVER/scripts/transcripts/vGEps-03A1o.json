  "title": "Are we cursed by Angels throughout the entire day for not giving charity? (Hadith) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] could you please explain the hadith from bukhari and muslim where the messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said there is not a day upon which the servant servant awakens but that two angels descend one of them says oh allah repay one who spends in charity the other says allah gives destruction to the one who withholds charity so does this mean that we are cursed through throughout the entire day if we do not give charity at all during the day what he says there's an authentic hadith that states that no day the sun rises except an angel says allah and when it sets they say something similar to remind you of that the life is short and you're about to die so he's saying that when the angels make such dua does it mean if we don't give in the cause of allah they are cursing us the answer is no this is simply a recommendation you have to understand that this can be taken as a curse if you are negligent and not fulfilling your duties what are my duties zakat so someone who does not pay zakat on time or doesn't care about zakat then the curse and the dua of the angels to give him a did not translate it o allah they pray the two angels oh allah give those who spend in charity what substitutes for what they had spent so if you give 10 give them substitution ten twenty seventy seven thousand whatever and those who withhold and do not spend in the cause of allah give them destruction poverty deprive them from their wealth so this dua can fit as a glove with those who gives a cat on time and those who deprives the cat but it does not fall under the category of people who do not do not give charity my zakat is xyz and i give it every year do i give anything in addition as charity general charity generous no do i fall under this door the answer is no though it would be better if i do yet the mandatory thing i'm doing i'm doing as requested so they do not fall under this and alano's best you"
