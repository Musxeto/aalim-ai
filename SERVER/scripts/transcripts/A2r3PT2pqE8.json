  "title": "Can you combine intentions when fasting and praying & fast for Allah and to loose weight",
  "transcript": "Consider Subscribing!!! So we have hopefully Muhammad khan \nfrom the UK? [Questioner:] while I know   that combining um multiple intentions for one act \nwhere you know a few of the intentions are worldly   intentions and the others are intentions \nto gain reward from Allah Azza Wa Jal   this is not allowed for example in the case \nof fasting if you are you know um trying to   have an intention where you want to lose weight \nand gain reward this is not allowed but [Sheikh]   not true, not true [Questioner] okay uh okay \nmaybe it's my misconception but uh but my question   actually is Sheikh uh, can we combine multiple \nintentions where um all of our intentions uh are   aimed to gain reward for Allah, from Allah Azza \nWa Jal and it's only for one act? [Sheikh] okay   first of all your first assumption is \nwrong because Allah says (speaking Arabic) this was addressed to the pilgrims the companions, \nwho went with the Prophet ﷺ during hajj   and refrained from selling and buying and when \npeople said why don't you sell and buy you're   coming from medina to mecca, get some goods \nsome merchandise and sell it make profit,   they said no we are in hajj, so Allah told \nthem that there is no conflict of interest,   you can perform hajj and still sell and \nbuy. Likewise, if someone is fasting,   what's your intention for fasting? He says to \nlose weight. Okay this is not fasting for Allah   again what's your intention for fasting he says to \nplease Allah Azza Wa Jal this is why I'm fasting   Mondays and Thursdays and I discovered that it \nalso helps me to reduce my weight so it's two   birds with one stone but my initial intention \nis for Allah, this is valid no problem in that.   Thirdly if you want to combine multiple intentions \nin a form of worship that's permissible to do   such as praying to raka's with the intention \nof Sunnatul Wudu and Tahhiyatul masjid and   the sunnah before fajr prayer, all of this is \nvalid in these two raka's and Allah knows best. you"
