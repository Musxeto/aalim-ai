  "title": "Are those who do Ruqyah excluded from the 70,000 that will go to Jannah without Account?",
  "transcript": "so we have abdel mujeeb from nigeria yesterday that states that uh 70 000 people my followers will enter paradise without accounts and the adults would not practice rukia and do not see an evil woman in things now does this mean that anyone who has practiced rookia is automatically not among these seventy thousand people please uh verify what jesus uh so abdul mujeeb from nigeria he says the hadith of the seventy thousand that would enter jannah without accountability or any type of torment and the prophet mentioned alessan four characteristics one of them is that they do not ask others for rookia yes and this is one of the biggest problems of learning islam through translation now when you read a translated text you're actually depending entirely on the understanding of the translator and so many times maybe not mastering the language you're reading the translation in causes you to fail and understand what the prophet assad meant by that and always give this example to our brothers who are non-arabs so in an article i read written by an imam in the u.s he was explaining the hadith of seven martyrs who do not die on the battlefield one of them the hadith says has two meanings in arabic one a person who dies by the plague the other meaning is the one whose stabbed with a knife so this imam took the other meaning misunderstood what was meant did not read the other hadiths that explained that the plague itself is a form of martyrdom and thought that this was referring to being stabbed with a knife of course this shifts the whole meaning 180 degrees so if someone mugs you with a knife asking for your wallet you remember the hadith and you remember this translation said no just go ahead and stab me i'll die as a martyr i don't want to fight and this is not what was intended so it is totally prohibited for non-arabs to give fatwas to elaborate on their own understanding without depending on scholars who preceded them in what they're saying and without arabic you cannot manage to do this the same thing with abdul mujeeb's understanding the hadith clearly states and if you look at all the other types of hadiths you will find that the prophet islam gave rookie to others mother aisha gave her to the prophet and this did not exclude them from the 70 000 simply because the hadith indicates that you must not ask people to do rookie for you if i'm sick lying on my bed someone comes in recites the fatih and recites the dura and should i stop him no let him do it may allah put the cure in that what is exempting you what is excluding you from the 70 000 is when someone comes and says oh i have this pain in me come on come give me is it haram no it's not haram but you lose the first class and go to economy you go to coach why because you've left the higher level and degree of having tawakkula and allah azza and now you're a little bit distracted and asking this brother or this sister to offer you rookia this is what will exclude you from the 70 000. so a word of advice learn arabic and if you don't know arabic follow a trusted sheikh imam school of thought an entity that has a good apida known for their character and moral conduct and religious conduct and they will lead you inshaallah to the right path and allah knows best"
