  "transcript": "The question, if a sister had a disease, like cancer, and she is now cured, does she have to inform her to-be husband about it? Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim. The deficiencies or the illnesses that deprive the husband from having a perfect marital life, they must be told to the husband in advance. And those illnesses or deficiencies that do not affect the husband, they are not to be told. And I'll give you an example. If a wife has a deficiency or an illness that prevents the husband from fully enjoying her. So she has a problem in her private parts, for example. Or she has, as in the case of breast cancer, she had one of her breasts surgically removed. May Allah cure all those who have this illness and prevent those who do not have it from having it. So a man proposes and we say, no, we are not going to tell him that she has only one breast. Is this permissible? No. He has to be informed because this affects how he is enjoying her. But if she has, for example, a birthmark on her back of shoulder, it's a big birthmark. Does she have to tell him? It has nothing to do with enjoying her. If she has an illness in her skin that is making her skin not acceptable or maybe it repels people if they see it. Yes, we have to tell him. If she has an illness that gives her mouth a very bad breath. We have dentists here. There are some illnesses that are not easily removed and they're permanent. And in Arabic fiqh, we call it abkhar. He's smelling and it is one of the excuses that permits a person from not attending salah. It's like onion and garlic. No, this is worse. So bad smell. If the woman has this, she has to be cleared. It has to be cleared to the husband. But if it's normal, no. Normal things. Imam Al Shaabi, he was one of the scholars of Islam and he had a lot of sense of humor in him. A man came to him and said, Sheikh, I married a woman and only discovered afterwards that she limps. So shall I return her back to her family? Because this is a defect. He says, yes, if you want to race with her, yes. Limping is not something that affects the marriage. So if she limps, I'm not going to race with her. She's not a horse. So this is not something that usually would affect the marriage. Allah Allah."
