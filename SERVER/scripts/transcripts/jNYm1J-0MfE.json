  "transcript": "aDNA says can we carry the koran in our luggage when traveling by air for example this seems to be permissible as long as the Koran is surrounded by clean pure clothes not with your shoes for example so if it's wrapped and in your clothes and you put it in the luggage that is that is totally permissible it is best that what I would do to have it on your carry-on bag so that it would be with you all the time"
