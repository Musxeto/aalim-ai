  "title": "Is it possible to transfer or donate good deeds to deceased? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "me with a wish second question he says it's possible to transfer good deeds to do dead people isn't there his app or accountability over when they die I'm not talking about the ongoing charity I am talking about if people cook food and want to reward or want the reward to go to the dead is this in the sooner I have always abstained from doing this we've talked about this a number of times and we said that the scholars had different point of view some of them opened it altogether and said whatever you do of good deeds you have the permissibility you have the approval to transfer it to anyone you want it's like a check that you write and you give it away so you recite surah al-fatiha said oh Allah I give the reward to my dead uncle you pray toric has a little message and I give this to my cousin late cousin and so on on the far extreme some scholars said no nothing what you do would help the deceased because Allah says what a lazily in sunny in La Mesa that man is rewarded only by what he had presented and done and this is not of his own doing and the middle path say that all good deeds that the Sun had come with are transferable so it has to be limited by the deeds that the Prophet has some told us about so hajj bdellium brutal battle this is acceptable whether it's done by a relative or it's done by a total stranger if he says that this hatch or this rumor is on the dead person's behalf it is accepted likewise charity whatever charity you do you give money to the pool you feed them you do this you do that it's all valid and it will be accepted in sha allah azza wajal but to pray on their behalf is not permissible to recite the quran and give them its reward it's not part of the sunnah and so on also we have fasting but there is a technical issue whether any fasting or only obligatory fasting and those who said obligatory fasting they are divided whether it's only the nether the devout fasting or the fasting in general that is mandatory and it's an issue of dispute and illogical knows best"
