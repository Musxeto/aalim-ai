  "title": "I try my best but Husband gets angry at small mishaps, it hurts, what should I do?",
  "transcript": "The next question is that I am a housewife and I do everything to keep my house 100% organized. But there are times when it is all kind of organized and my husband becomes very angry at me. It hurts me a lot. My husband is always busy with Islamic activities and his work. And I just ask him for one day to spend the day with me. But he usually tries to make it up but sometimes he doesn't. And I feel that I am being ungrateful to him. What shall I do? The husband raise his hand please. Chicken. So this husband is an ignorant imbecile. Why? Ya Akhi, your wife does all what she can do to help you and to serve you and to keep your house clean. And the moment she makes a mistake or trip, you make her life hell? You're not a real man. Seriously. And I have no problem in calling a spade a spade. If you were a real man, you would not deal with your wife like this. Tomorrow you're going to have a daughter. How would you like your son-in-law to treat your daughter? You do have a sister. How do you like your brother-in-law to deal with your sister? This is unfortunately the trend in so many families. I will not say from which subcontinent. But you can imagine. This is a trend. Akhi, what kind of way you treat your daughter-in-law, your sister-in-law or even your wife? They're not slaves. They're human beings. And so many times sisters come to me and say, Sheikh, the Prophet said in an authentic hadith, Oh women folk, give charity. For I had seen you, the majority of the people of hellfire. The women said, Why? He said, Because you do kufr. And kufr means disbelief or ingratitude. It has both meanings in Arabic. So but the Prophet is not relating it to kufr disbelief, rather ingratitude. He says, If your man does well all year round and then trips, he does a mistake. You say, Wallahi, we have never seen anything good from you. All the men are saying, Oh yes, Sheikh, talk to me. Wallahi, this is exactly what's happening in my house. The sisters say, Sheikh, didn't the Prophet say something similar to the men? I said, No, because real men don't do this. Sheikh, my husband does this all the time. He makes life hell on earth. He says, You're not kind to my mother. Wallahi, I serve his mother more than I serve my mother. He says, You're not kind to my sisters. You do this, you do that. Unfortunately, there are men who needs scolding and admonishing and reprimanding. Because they're not real men. So this brother who spends all his day in da'wah, masha'Allah, and smiles with the brothers, and he has probably longer beard than mine. And when he sees his brothers, As-salamu alaykum, jazakallahu khayran, barakallahu fi, masha'Allah. When he goes to his wife, he's a monster. No, this is not a real Muslim. He doesn't walk the talk. This is not the way of our Prophet, a.s. Don't fool yourself. You can fool everybody else. You're not going to fool Allah, a.s. So be careful. Khayrukum, the best of you, are those the best to his community? No, the best to his wives. So you want to check on Sheikh Asim? Go and check with his family, with his wife. How is he? Please don't. No, seriously. You want to know someone? Go check his family. How is he? Go check his servants, his drivers, his maid, his subordinates, his neighbors. This, what gives you a real preview and 360, as we call it in XT profiling, to know whether he is as he claims or not. Oh, coming back to the question. Sister, you have to tolerate your husband. Again. Okay, I've bashed men on the head. But come on, give me a break. This man of yours, he's, mashallah, a complete evil? Of course not. He puts food on the table. He puts a roof on your head. He's kind to your family. He helped your mother so many times. He gave your brother a lot of money to start his business when he lost. So why aren't you appreciating? Why are you only highlighting the bad things about him? Fear Allah, you too. So I think I bashed them all. I don't have any friends anymore."
