  "title": "What is Tawheed of Asma wa Sifaat (The Basics 6)",
  "transcript": "we talked about two branches of tahit and that is the heed of lordship and of worship the third branch of tawheed is to heed of the beautiful names and attributes of allah azza wajal and this is where a believer worships allah azzawajal by calling him by acknowledging him through his beautiful names and attributes the prophet alaihis wasallam said allah has 99 names 100 minus 1. whoever calculates them will enter jannah calculating them means that you memorize them that you know them that you understand what they mean and that you implement them in your life so the core of this branch of tahit lies upon your belief that allah has no equivalent to him nothing is compared to him nothing is unlike to him like him subhanahu azzawajal in anything the core is to believe in allah's beautiful names so when you say ar-rahim when you say ar-razak when you call him by his name al-khafur or ar-rahman or al-latif all of these names have many profound and strong meanings and the more you know them the closer you get to allah and if you remember last ramadan allah has blessed me to introduce to you the beautiful names of allah it's found on zad's youtube channel on my youtube channel on my website i would highly advise you to go and study them because this lays the foundation and cements your iman and strengthens it beyond recognition so that it would be an astonishing event in your life when you introduce the beautiful names of allah to your life so how to believe in allah's beautiful names and attributes by only believing that we cannot know or understand the beautiful names and attributes of allah except through what allah has told us about himself and what the prophet told us about allah and we take these beautiful names and attributes as they are we understand them as they were revealed to us in the arabic language without any distortion so we do not play with words without any twisting or misinterpret is misinterpretation so we don't say that yeah this is the word but it means something else without denying the reality and without asking how these attributes are and if you look at all the deviant sects and cults who went astray like the jahmyah like the murtazilah and those who followed suit like the asha'ira and maturidiya you'll find that they have done one of these mistakes or more in the beautiful names of allah and his beautiful attributes by distortion by manipulating or misunderstanding by denying the meaning totally and all of this took them astray"
