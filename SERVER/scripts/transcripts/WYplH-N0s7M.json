  "transcript": "Nazim from France. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. I have a question for a Muslim friend who is an order baker. Who is doing what? Who is packing the orders from clients. Usually it's food and sometimes frozen items and sometimes he received to pack orders with pork meat. So my question was is this job allowed in Islam? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazak. Akhi, it's a rule of thumb to know whether your job is halal or haram. Anything that assists others on haram is haram. Period. So if you're packing groceries that contain pork or intoxicants is this halal to use? The answer is no. Then it's haram for you to pack. It's haram for you to sell. It's haram for you to carry from one place to the other. It's haram for you to put on the shelves and the likes. So he has to definitely avoid this and the rest is halal inshallah."
