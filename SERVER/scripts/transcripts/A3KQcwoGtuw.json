  "title": "Giving Dawah but unable to do it myself || assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Belly from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Every time I give dawah, like every time I tell people about some particular ibadah, I fail to do it afterwards. Like if I tell someone to do Qiyam ul layl, after that I fail to do qiyam al layl. It's not like I can blame Iblis because I'm already doing Ruqayyah for some health issues. So why does this happen to me? I'm really depressed, please help. There is nothing to do. When you give dawah to people, you should be the first one to benefit from it. But if you're unable to benefit from it, this should not stop you from giving dawah. You see, every individual is obliged to do four things. You're obliged to instruct people to go to do good things, like Qiyamul Layl, tahajjud. Secondly, you are instructed to do it yourself. Thirdly, you're instructed to forbid evil, such as smoking. Fourthly, you yourself must refrain from smoking. Now if one of these four items is not fulfilled, this does not mean that we have to cancel the others. So if I can order people to offer tahajjud, and advise them, and teach them, but me myself, I'm lazy, or I'm unable to do it, or I always wake up late after the Adhan of Fajr, I shouldn't allow shaitan to make me feel ashamed and embarrassed, and hence refrain from encouraging people to offer night prayer. Likewise, if I have the ability to order my children not to smoke, smoking is haram, smoking is bad for you, smoking is a waste of money, smoking makes you stink. But me myself, I'm unable to kick the habit. So just because I'm weak and I smoke, doesn't mean when I see my children smoke, I say to myself, hmm, if I can't stop it myself, I should let them be. No. So you do your level best in encouraging people to do good deeds, and you yourself try your level best to do it as well. But if you fail, but if you fail, you shouldn't stop encouraging people to do good deeds, and I hope this makes sense."
