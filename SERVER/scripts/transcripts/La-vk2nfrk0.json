  "transcript": "Affan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. I have a question about the Friday prayer. Okay. So my question is, like, in my country there are many people who pray four rakah Sunnah, after that four rakah Fard and after that two rakah of Sunnah. Okay. They pray like, after two Friday prayers they pray like four rakah and one more four rakah of Sunnah. Is this right or wrong? Okay. What the people are doing is not in accordance to the way of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. And we've stated this so many times. You can end up praying 20 rakahs, 100 rakahs. Good for you? No, it's not good for you. As long as you're not following the footsteps of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam, you're going astray. Why did Allah send the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam to us? To teach us, to be our role model. Who are you following? Oh, Mawlana said, okay, but the way of the Prophet is different than Mawlana. Well, I'd rather follow Mawlana. Okay, you'll end up with Mawlana, but not with the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam in Paradise. Because you chose other than the way of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. Allah says in Surah An-Nisa, Chapter 4, وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَىٰ And whoever goes astray against the way of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam, and follows other than the way of the believers, we will make him follow whoever he follows, and we will throw him in hellfire. Do you want to end up like this? Of course not. But I intended to do good. Well, your intention is not sufficient. It has to comply with the way of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. What is the way of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? He used to not pray any sunnah before Jumu'ah. And if he prayed in the masjid after the fard of Jumu'ah, he would pray four rak'ahs. But if he did not pray anything in front of the congregation after the salat, and went home, he would pray only two rak'ahs home. That's it. Now you come and say, well, in our country, Mawlana say, pray four rak'ah sunnah in the masjid. Good for you. After the fard. I agree. Then he says, pray four rak'ah fard. Whoa! Hold your horses. What are you praying? He says, these are four rak'ah fard. What fard? We just prayed Jumu'ah. Two rak'ahs. Some of them said, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, but this is not a valid Jumu'ah. That's why we're praying dhuhr, four rak'ah. Doesn't make any sense. Well, it doesn't have to make any sense. This is what Simon says, and Simon says, do. And then we pray another four rak'ah sunnah or nafl. Come on, give me a break. Is this part of Islam? No. So you choose what you want to follow."
