  "transcript": "Anas. Anas from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Nice to meet you Sheikh. Same here. What can I do for you? I don't know if someone has a muddy coming out, the sticky one, or urine, but it's not like continuous, and the spray time is about to end. Assalamu Alaikum. If you have emission of pre-cum or semen, or there is a prosthetic fluid, methy, and it is not continuous, you have to wash it off, wash your private part and testicles, and clean or sprinkle water on whatever may have been touched by such impurity, perform wudu, and pray when it has stopped. You cannot pray while it's being emitted, if you know that it is going to be emitted for maybe 5, 10, 15 minutes, and then it will stop. But if you know that it is continuous 24 hours, 7 days a week, in this case you're ma'zur, which means that the moment the Adhan is offered, whenever you want to go pray, you do the same procedure of cleaning and washing yourself, making wudu, and then you may pray regardless of whatever comes from you, because it's continuous and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
