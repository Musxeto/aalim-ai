  "transcript": "uh suhail's second question is if we have three stages this life the hereafter and in between there is al-barzah these are the three stages where we live in so how is it possible that the prophet saw alaihis people in paradise when he went in the miraculous night journey the scholars say that either allah azzawajal made him see this as a vision or as a dream and we know that the dream and vision of prophets are a revelation so before i continue it's also known to you insha'allah through watching ask zad or ask or our programs that the night journey took place physically and spiritually once but there were many night journeys that took place spiritually only where the prophet was to see things and this was with his soul not with his body so many of the scholars say that this can be a vision where he saw for example a maid or a concubine by a palace and when he asked who was it for they told him that this was for romer or when he heard the flip-flops of bilal in front of him in jannah though bilal was in his home in mecca so they say that this was a vision allah showed him what will happen in the future as a vision some scholars said that this was also part of the unseen that was revealed to the prophet salallahu salaam but we know for certain that the people of jannah would not enter jannah until they are held accountable on the day of judgement so they might be in their own spot or garden of paradise in their graves not in the jannah that we will enter in sha after the day of judgment and allah azza knows best"
