  "title": "Made a vow to Allah not to like anyone & thinks she is impure or did Shirk if she breaks vow",
  "transcript": "Lamia from Bangladesh. Sheikh, last time I told you about my question, but I guess I was not able to understand you. So, my question is, my sister promised Allah that she will not love anyone from the opposite gender. But like she broke her promise and for that boy's satisfaction, she first she committed shirk, like she was touching a thing and feeling it as if she was touching Allah. So, she committed shirk and how to be a Muslim again and will that thing she touched as if she was feeling Allah, will that thing and she become impure and how to be a Muslim again? Okay, I will answer you, Inshallah. Lamia from Bangladesh, she said I did not understand her question. I did understand her question. There is no kufr, there is no shirk, unless she is worshipping that boy and thinking that he is Allah who makes things halal and haram, who gives life and death, etc. This is not logical. Nobody does this at all. So, let this out of your mind."
