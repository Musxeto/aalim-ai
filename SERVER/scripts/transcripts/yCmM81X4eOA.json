  "transcript": "so about the man from the UK had two questions the first question about the ruling on using morphine which is a painkiller as a drug so is this permissible or not the permanent committee of IFTA had headed by chef bimba's may allah have mercy on his soul had a fatwa stating that if there is no other alternative to it and the doctors who are trustworthy stated that this helps and there are no side effects in this case it is halal insha allah when used for an appropriate purpose and a legitimate reason likewise a lot of the brothers and sisters asked about using marijuana as a form of treatment and we know that it is legal now in some states in the u.s. though there is a very long battle legally because it goes against the federal law of prohibiting the sell selling of drugs either for entertainment or for medical reasons unless it is approved by the FDA in long story so what's the ruling on using marijuana scholars again stated that if it is a necessity it's not for fun it's not for entertainment and there is no other halal alternative because it intoxicates it makes you high it makes you stoned and the one who prescribed it is trustworthy doctor and there are no side effects such as addiction a person and be addicted to it and finally fifthly it is used only as needed meaning that you don't need to smoke a joint and you take like a half a bag and you say well I it's for medical reasons no you have to limit it to the prescribed amount and not exceed that these five conditions if applicable in this case it becomes hella inshallah"
