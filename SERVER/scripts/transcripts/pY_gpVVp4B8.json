  "transcript": "Nazrin from Bangladesh. Sheikh, I have asked about the issue on your website without enough details, so I am asking it here again. I have cleaned blood of lenses from my mattress incorrectly. I just rubbed only and removed the blood with wet cloth, wet tissue and a soap. When the impure mattress was still moist and damp, I kept my pillows for one minute or less and also checked with my hand couple of times that it had dried or not, thinking the area to be correctly purified. Now I have forgotten and I am not sure that my hands and pillows then got the wetness of impurity on them or not. But when I touched the mattress, I felt the coldness of the wet mattress on my hand. Now sometimes I am inclined to the thought that my pillows did not get the wetness, but my hand got the wetness and sometimes I am inclined to the thought that maybe both got the wetness and also sometimes I have the thought that none of them got wetness. I have touched many things afterwards, so what can be the solution, Sheikh? How would I know? Come on, give me a break. When you make a Bollywood movie out of so trivial things, this is not logical. You make a mistake and you cascade this mistake intentionally by doing... Who would put pillows on an area that he is not certain whether it's pure or not, and then he touches the area with his hands and then it's soiled or not, and he touches the pillow. You are making a movie out of this and this is not Islam. Whenever you try to complicate things, whenever you try to make life hard upon yourself, believe me, Allah will make it harder. You're challenging Allah Azza wa Jal when you do these things. Of course now here is a reverse mechanism or the defense. So, oh no, no, I'm just afraid of impurity transferring elsewhere. If you were truly afraid, you would not have done all of this. You would have taken the appropriate measurement to avoid such impurities from transferring. But you are recklessly behaving and making a long plot and a scenario, and then coming and asking questions. Sometimes people come and ask me about soiling the whole house from a small drop of urine that came into their hand. They neglected it. They touched the tap and the faucets and the doorknob and the light switch and they touched their feet and they walked with their feet on the carpet to the living room, to the bedroom, and then they climbed over their bed and they touched the pillow and they touched the pillow from a single drop of urine, they've managed to contaminate the whole house. This is not urine, this is acid. Even if it's acid, it wouldn't last that long. It would have burnt a few places and that's it. But look what shaitan is doing to you. And at the end of the day, you should say, oh sheikh, I have so much whispers, what can I do? The whole house is soiled. Sheikh, can I burn it? This is the end? You want to burn the whole house to purify it? What is this? So again, we have rules and regulations in Islam that covers things. Certainty is not affected by doubt. If you've noticed in your question, you've used the word, I feel, I maybe, perhaps, I think. All of these are phrases used in doubt. Just put them in the dustbin and move on with your life."
