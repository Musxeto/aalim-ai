  "transcript": "Saliheen from Canada. He says, we know that \nremorse is repentance, as in the hadith states,   meaning that the biggest pillar of repentance is \nto be remorseful. Without it, your repentance is   not accepted. How can we attain true remorse? \nAnd this question I've been getting frequently.   Remorse is not wandering in the streets at night, \nslapping your face, and blaming yourself for what   had happened. This is not Islamic remorse. \nRemorse is a burning feeling in your heart.   It's the regret. It's the fear that Allah may \nnot accept your repentance. It's the fear that   Allah would throw you in hell because of that \nparticular sin. This is remorse. That drives you   firmly not to do it again. But when a \nperson does a sin, a particular sin,   and every time he sits with the boys, is 'Whoa \nman, that night was one heck of a night. Yeah we   did bad things, we were bad boys but, it was fun. \nI wish we can do it again. Where's the remorse? If   you talk to him, he says yea yea 'Alhamdulillah, \nI've repented, I intend not to do it again,   I acquitted it and I ask Allah for forgiveness.' \nYeah, but where is the remorse? 'I'm,   yeah, I'm not, I'm not remorseful. To tell you the \ntruth, I'm not remorseful.' Your repentance is not   accepted. 'Wow, though I'm not doing anymore?' \nYes. You have to have this remorse in your heart   because, if you don't, this means that \nyou didn't do it for the sake of Allah.   And you are almost certain that Allah will \nforgive you and put you in Paradise before   everyone else. And this is a complete disaster. \nYou must have this remorse in your heart.   People coming and saying, 'Sheikh, I \ndon't watch any movies anymore but,   that particular movie, I wish I could watch \npart two of it.' Where is the remorse?   It's not existing. This doesn't mean that you \ndon't like, or you did not like such a sin. Yeah,   there are sins that are lucrative and nice and \nbeautiful but you still feel remorse for doing   them. You're ashamed from exposing yourself in \nfront of others because of being shameful of such   a sin. This is the burning feeling. How to get \nit? Is to read more about Allah's beautiful Names   and Attributes. Learn more about Allah. The more \nAllah Azza wa Jal knowledge fills your heart,   the greater remorse you would have over \nyour previous sins. And Allah knows best."
