  "transcript": "from bangladesh the shaytan twists his mind in regards of some of the verses of the quran some of the names of allah to change the meaning into bad words and bad meanings in his language so is he sinful for that no you're not sinful such intrusive thoughts from shaytan allah has forgiven for the sake of the prophet haslam providing you don't speak about it and you don't act upon it so as long as it's in your mind and you're blocking it and you're thinking of something else or saying for allah there's no problem in that"
