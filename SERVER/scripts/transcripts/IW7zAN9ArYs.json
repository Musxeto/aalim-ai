  "transcript": "Irfan from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh saw him in my high school. They do Hindu prayers every morning. It is like for one minute or two minutes. Can I stay there for that time? If you can leave them and go to your classroom without being reprimanded or punished for that, yes you have to leave them. You cannot join the disbelievers in such gathering when they do their Kafir Hindu prayers. But if you know that they are going to sack you or to prevent you from things that are yours or they may reprimand you or even beat you, in this case just stand with them and recite Ayatul Kursi and the Shahada and whatever you want, pretending that you're with them but you're actually giving them Tawheed and Allah knows best."
