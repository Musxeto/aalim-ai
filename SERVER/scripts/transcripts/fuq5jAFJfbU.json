  "title": "Should I pray alone or in congregation if I arrived late to the masjid?",
  "transcript": "Mashhad says when I reached the Masjid the congregational prayer was over is it better for me to wait for someone to come so I can pray Jamar or prayer alone which is best we all know that the Prophet alehissalaam had told us that the prayer in congregation is better than 25 and another narration 27 times than the prayer of an individual so if you come to the Masjid and you find that the congregation was over it is best for you to wait for a few minutes if you're hoping that someone as late as you would come and join you in praying congregation and it is not true what some Muslims believe that only the first congregation is allowed and anything afterwards is void you should pray alone and not pray a second or a third jamar or a third congregation this is not true because the prophet alayhi salatu salam once concluded Fechter prayer and after he finished the salat one of his companions came late so the prophet alayhi Salam addressed his congregation who had prayed Fajr and who know that praying voluntary prayer after fajar is not permissible because this is the time of restriction and prohibition yet the Prophet Allah so salam told them who among you would go and give charity to this late comer meaning who among you would pray with him so that they both would be praying congregation and it would be charity from him upon his brother so this is an a seal of approval from the prophet alayhi salatu salam for forming a second congregation not that it is recommended or something to be praised but rather it is to encompass people's needs and necessities people have needs maybe they were late for a legitimate reason why deprive them from the reward of a congregational prayer so this is permissible for you to wait if you hope that someone will come and join you in sha Allah"
