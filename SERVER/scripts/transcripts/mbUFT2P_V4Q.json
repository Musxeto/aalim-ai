  "transcript": "uh i have question i'm working in a real estate company and we are giving services to the people okay so once example the flat is vacant the tenant is due to clean the apartment or property and he have to make it so the new tenant will move in in the contract it's mentioned the tenant have to do it in the time period of his tenancy contract now once they vacate the apartment we have our own people from other maintenance company we have contact with them and we are making the maintainers on their behalf so can we take our profit from it is it any example the market rate is one thousand for uh maintenance and from my uh contact people we are giving him 500 and the remaining 500 which is the balance can we keep it is it first of all is this by agreement with the previous tenant uh i don't understand meaning my uh lease ends in two weeks time so in these two weeks time i'm obliged to clean and paint and fix everything in my flat before vacating it correct yes so instead of me doing it personally i approach you and i say can you do this for me and you say okay we will charge you a thousand dirham if i say okay i'm fine with that and you get subcontractors for 500 and keep 500 for yourself this is totally halal no but the thing is that the tenant they just vacate the apartment and they don't do the maintenance who's paying for the this are you charging it from their uh deposit deposit yes if you're charging it from their deposit and you contact them and they refuse to do it themselves then you can do this and take 500 your profit because this is not your job and you are entitled to charge them whatever suits you within reason inshallah but it is mentioned in the contract that once they hand over the key so that real state will take care of it we cannot return back the key to them okay but what about the deposit yeah from the deposit only the deposit we are taking for that reason only yeah yeah it seems no problem inshallah because who whose responsibility is it in the contract to fix it as it was received in the beginning yes within this is tenant responsibility but it is mentioned that within the contract period they have to do it and once their contract ends they have to make maintenance and hand over the key to us and if they fail to do this then your responsibility is to do it and charge it to their deposit yeah no problem inshallah i see no problem in that you"
