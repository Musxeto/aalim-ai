  "title": "Is it ok to rely only on the Quran and not the Hadith or Sunnah ? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother asif salah here asks about a very common question that unfortunately only those who are ignorant who do not know about the islamic sciences come and put forward and the question is we are confident that the quran is the word of allah azza wajal and that it is 100% authentic no one can tamper or play with it what we are not as confident when it comes to the prophetic Sunnah the hadith of the Prophet Ali salatu salam due to the fact that Buhari may allah be pleased with him and have mercy on his soul came so many years after the Prophet ala so solemn and so the other hadith or Mahad Athene and some of them say that this hadith is authentic and this one is weak and this one is fabricated etc so what to say to them first of all we say to them that you tell me what do you think is appropriate way of handling this he will tell you hmm after I didn't think of that I was waiting for you to lecture me but now you've turning the tables and asking me what do I think I think that we should ignore the hadith said okay hamdulillah we ignore the hadith what are the consequences of that the consequences are that people would turn to the Quran but the Quran doesn't give them all the answers they have for the questions it doesn't give them enough information because Allah Azza WA JAL detailed the answers and the information in there sooner so if you say that because I'm not so comfortable with the hadith you say I will rely only on the Quran and okay what about the prayers how many prayers per day and night so at five why do you know their five said people are praying like this so how do you know that people are right how many rock has integer how many records in Maghreb how many records in awesome how many sister per each rocker how many rocker or rock or in each unit what to say when to decide the fatty Hawaii recite the fatty hell out or not silent all of this is from the Sunna and you can build thousands literally thousands of similar questions when it comes to fasting to zakat to Hajj when it comes to transactions when it comes to prescribed punishments when it comes to rulings when it comes to marriage divorce or it when it comes to robe are so many things and the sky is the limit without the sooner you cannot understand the quran' so now they are stuck between a rock and a hard place they say yes but then they don't want the sunnah why don't you want the sooner because the sunnah governs their lives and makes those who want to pursue the desires and lusts make their lives difficult when it's with the quran yes i think okay wine is haram it's mentioned in the quran but if i drink a glass of vodka or a tequila then okay it's not wine wine is from greats this is the Arabic language look what's it mentioned the Quran so they find their way out through only focusing on the Quran and misinterpreting the verses because they're not doing it through the proper channel which is the Sunnah of the Prophet SM that clarifies what is ambiguous to us and this is why Allah sent us the Prophet as a cinema now second of all they have failed miserably when they say we're comfortable the Quran if you receive if you recite and read and you will find it in black and white that the Prophet said that Allah Azrael said that whatever the Prophet brings you you have to obey and whatever he prohibits you you have to refrain and Allah tells us obey the Prophet erase a lot of sinner and the illogical mentions al-hikmah which is the prophetic saying the wisdom that is mentioned in the houses of the prophets wives sallallaahu reall be pleased with him so many verses of the Quran telling you to follow the Prophet and to make him your judge how is this possible if it were not to be referred to the Sunnah of the Prophet Alex awesome so this is a crystal-clear point my friend Asif and I hope this answers your question"
