  "transcript": "[Music] and we have abu hamza from egypt i have a question about the wisdom of repenting you see we know from sharia that repenting people return to a life without right so if someone commits fornication for instance uh he returns like he didn't do this sin or god has mercy on him or his sin so how is it or where is the wisdom when these people are being seen as equals to people who haven't done this thing like if someone fornicates he has received the pleasure he has done something other people haven't done so why is he equal to someone who hasn't done this sin i will answer inshallah from egypt he says i don't understand the wisdom of repentance and that when you repent from a sin as if you did not commit the sin because this seems unfair if we have two people one of them did not ever commit a sin in his life and the other one for example fornicated and then repented the other one had the pleasure of halal illicit relationships and had the fun of it and then repented so how can they be exactly the same well actually they can't first of all they're not because no way allah azzawajal would honor someone who sinned and repented to make him in the same level of someone who did never sin allah's justice and fairness would not be as such but it's like we mentioned before when it comes to the concept of al jazeera when you recite the three times this is equivalent to reciting the full quran once would that person who recited three times in less than a minute be rewarded in the same reward that a person took a whole day to recite the quran from cover to cover assuming that this is permissible if not in three days that would not be logical but the reward is different than what is actually recorded so allah can give you one reward for a good deed while the other would multiply it to 700 folds likewise someone who did not sin at all in his life would be rewarded plenty though the one who had sinned and repented would be forgiven as if he did not have a sin but he won't be in the same category what is most important than all of this abu hamsa is the notion the idea that you allow yourself to question the fairness of a ruling this is dangerous if you open the pandora box satan would mess up with your head big time so i urge you to reconsider that whenever you get these intrusive thoughts to suppress them and believe in what allah has to believe in what allah is rather than question and why is this why is that this doesn't make any sense because this is a very dangerous venue you"
