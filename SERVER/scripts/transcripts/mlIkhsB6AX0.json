  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ grief over martyrdom of his companions assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "This is not to you, leave it as it is. He grieved over the martyrdom of three of his beloved companions in the Battle of Mu'tah, where three thousand Muslims went to fight over a hundred thousand troops of the Byzantines. Three thousand against a hundred thousand and some say more than that. So the three leaders of the army in succession were martyred. Zayd ibn Harithah, the son of the Prophet ﷺ in adoption before it was abolished, he was martyred. Then his cousin appointed after him to be the leader, if anything would happen to Zayd, Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, the Prophet's cousin and the brother of Ali. And he was martyred after two of his arms were amputated during battle. And this is why he's seen in paradise having two wings flying wherever he wants as a martyr. After that, the third in succession was Abdullah ibn Rawaha, the poet of the Prophet ﷺ. They were all martyred and the companions felt that they will be defeated until Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, took the flag, led the army and managed to retreat by defeating the army of the enemy, thinking that they had reinforcement. The Prophet was with his companions when all of a sudden his face changed. And mother Aisha said, I could see from the crack of the door when the Prophet was with his companions, signs of grief and sorrow over his face, over the demise of his three beloved companions. And this hadith shows that showing and expressing your grief, if a calamity befalls upon you, does not take you out of those who trust and rely on Allah as long as there is content in your heart."
