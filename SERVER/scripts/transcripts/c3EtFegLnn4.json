  "title": "Husband sends me to my parents house for a year, does not provide, or call, sinful if I donâ€™t call?",
  "transcript": "from the emirates sorry i'm a little bit nervous and i've been married for 16 years and i have three kids so in my life whenever there is a problem my husband will not solve the issue instead he will just send me my home and will not call me he will not take the expenses for one year or more than that and he will come back after one year after that he will come back and we will return like to the normal life this already happened three times in my life and i felt more worthless and i don't want to be burdened for my family so i went with him and right now i'm in the same situation and i'm in uae and he's in india now and for five months he's not calling me yeah he's not taking uh he's not taking the expense or nothing like that as we are having a rental agreement for before two months he just did that and i have got a courage to do the online classes and i'm a little bit earning for my ourself for me and my children and for to for two months i'm taking the complete expenses of my family and this time i didn't made any any attempt to call him yet to convince him so everyone are blaming me like i'm not taking the responsibility like i'm not calling him or i'm not convincing his family so it i like it is like a mental torture for me and i want to know that i'm a sinful sheikh yeah for not calling him yeah i'm afraid that if it happens against yeah if i call him that i'm afraid that it will happen again so usher can you give me any advice that what should i do okay first of all such issues are not solved in a q a on tv and this is why we have counseling sessions but in counseling sessions i can listen to more details i can ask you more questions and maybe we have to sit and talk to the husband himself this is not possible here so i'll give you the sequence this usually works number one you've been married for 16 years with three kids and he has done this three times possibilities for me as a counselor number one is that he is an evil person he doesn't fear allah maybe he's a mummy's boy so his mom says to him send her home and he does that and there are lots especially from the subcontinent unfortunately who are not real men they don't have a spine so whatever mama says to them or baba says to them they will do it immediately in this case this is a different scenario number two maybe he did this because as a victim you come on live tv you talk to me and the sheikh is soft-hearted and he cries with you and you say the poor thing not knowing that she's the villain and the poor victim is the man when you speak to the man and this is what i usually do and the man says things that whoa see when you listen to one party you make a mistake so i listen to you and i say well your husband needs to be hanged but when i listen to him and he refutes what you said and explains his position with evidences i said your wife should stand in front of a firing squad and when they both sit together and i listen to him and to her at the same time while there exposing each one's reality 50 of what he said goes down the drain 50 percent or more of what she said goes down the drain because now there's someone to rectify or to to say or falsify what the other party is saying so i have to listen to his side of the story let us assume because this is not a counseling chess session let us assume everything you said was right that he's a mummy's boy he doesn't fear allah he doesn't provide for you or your children he sends you to your parents house for six months and sometimes for a year until you beg and patch things up this is not a real man him not providing for you and for your children is a legitimate reason to go for divorce but would we encourage women to go for divorce sometimes he's the best of the two evils not the worst so if she were to be divorced she would not have anyone to provide for her which is the case at the moment or she would not have a shelter or a house to take her in with her children so she would be forced to do heinous things so some women we say it's like cancer you have to live with it until he dies then you will inherit him inshallah other than that i cannot help you because his parents are as evil as he is and this guy as i said he's spineless so this is your test from allah sometimes a woman is no capable and financially independent why would you stay with such a wimp someone who treats you like trash if what you're saying is true see all of these things are a cocktail depending on the situation which i'm unable to determine at the moment so this is your choice this is your life now am i sinful for not calling him if you're not the oppressor if you're not the wrong doer why would i call him if he treats me like this i'm giving him an alibi i'm giving him an excuse to repeat and do this every time he doesn't feel good or he doesn't like what i do so is this a kind of a life is this a marriage no it's not and believe me allah would not leave him alone if you're listening to me i doubt you listen to some sheikh from saudi arabia like myself especially the one who insults men when they're wrong doing but if you were listening to me wallahi allah will not leave you alone you can do whatever you want to this woman and to your children you can oppress them like hell no no problem in that go ahead don't ever think for a moment that allah is going to leave you alone it's coming if it did not come yet wait for it wait for it and it's come but when the wrath of allah comes you would have wished that you would not have ever done such a thing to your wife and your children so may allah make things easy for you you"
