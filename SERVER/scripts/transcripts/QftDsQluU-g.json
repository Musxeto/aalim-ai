  "transcript": "uh chef my question is regarding my uh current profession uh you know i am engaged in uh group uh treasury where we make borrowings from banks uh you know and other financial transactions so uh we have a mix of you know islamic and uh as you can say non-islamic yeah right interest in transactions and transactions like muraba and wakalas etc so uh at this point uh what would you advise me because uh you know there's a mix there's a you know if you take most of our transactions uh you know uh uh sharia compatible and there are certain transactions uh that we do which are you know we we borrow on od interest so what would uh be your advice okay i will answer insha allah from sri lanka says i work in a mixed bank that has um islamic windows and none and conventional transactions which is ribba-based so what do you advise me if you work for both then you have to leave the job if you're working in a department that only deals with halal transactions has nothing to do with the ribba-based transactions as in the case of a bank trying to separate and split their transactions to be islamic and non-islamic and a number of banks are doing so to the extent that even if they have their offices in the building of the conventional bank that they belong to they pay rent annually to the conventional banks so that their income would be totally separated and segregated from the income and transactions of the bank if this is the case and you are aiming to establish an islamic transaction department or bank or branch then this is permissible but if you are doing both jobs so someone comes to you said i need to do muraba so okay here's the form and you help him through and someone else says i need a hundred thousand dollars um loan how much interest are you going to charge me for i said okay we're going to charge you this and that no this is totally prohibited and you have to quit"
