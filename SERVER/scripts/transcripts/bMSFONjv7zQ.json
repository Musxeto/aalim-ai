  "transcript": "Sayyid from Singapore Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Salam to Allah Ah yeah okay so my question for today is that recently I encountered a pushy professional beggar at a hawker center recently and they are known for their aggressive sales tactics. Majority of them are foreigners hired by a syndicate and they are here on a on a tourist visa where they are not supposed to work with such a visa and they can't and they don't take no for an answer and can become physically and verbally abusive. If I call the police they can't intervene only suggesting a costly complaint. I know honesty is crucial in Islam but in this situation is it acceptable for me to say that I can't afford to give them money from bothering me further? If I understood your question correctly, if these professional beggars are illegal in your country and they're physically and verbally abusive and they don't take no for an answer and they keep on insisting on you, yeah you call the police let them take them and extradite him or throw them in prison. This is not your problem inshallah and there's nothing wrong in that and Allah azza wa jalla knows best. This is all"
