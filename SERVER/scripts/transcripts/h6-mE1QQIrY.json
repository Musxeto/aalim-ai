  "transcript": "Juwayria from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh I have a problem concerning my elder brother in back in our hometown he's 30 years old and he's not working he's normal but not fully he doesn't have a mental illness but if you talk to you will see that he's not that mature a few weeks ago he started selling awful services through his whatsapp stages he posted pictures strange pictures like eggs with arabic writings on them black cows drawing of dolls as men and women bad luck etc and he captions those photos like i quote this is to block or to control someone's lives but perform seher on someone send jeans and so on he says he works with jeans and also the quran he mentions a lot in what he said and misguide people he's not ignorant at all about islam initially i didn't believe it until he posted a video of himself moving objects with his hand and i come to the conclusion that he's learning black magic so i i would like to know what approach i should take regarding this should i tell my parents uh knowing that we just received the news that my mom has intestine cancer and has just undergone surgery and also he's really stubborn and doesn't like remarks so what should i do should i just pray for him or just mind my own business okay first of all you have to inform your father because your father is his father and he's the one who is the head of the family and has control over him and can do something about it secondly if he is in a country that adheres to islamic law you should give him sincere advice that what he's doing takes him out of the fold of islam and it's one of the major sins and of the seven major sins of islam if he doesn't stop then you should inform the authorities so that they could do what is necessary to block him from harming people with his kufr and with his evil acts and of course thirdly you have to make dua that allah guides him back to islam and allah knows best"
