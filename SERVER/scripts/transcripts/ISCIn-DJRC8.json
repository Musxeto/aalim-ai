  "transcript": "abdulaziz from Sri Lanka ABD how are you doing alhamdulillah I can't hear you properly Abdul aiz yeah she can you hear me now yes uh she my question is if someone looked into another person's house without their permission a house which is across the road and which has like no blankets no cing just like the windows are just open there and someone looked into the house and uh I know that it's a sin so for that should the person go across the road and uh ask forgiveness from that stranger or is it sufficient he repents to Allah and asks for forgiveness for that if you don't if you don't mind a black eye or a broken nose no problem nobody goes and knock on people people's doors and say sheh listen forgive me I was crossing the street and I saw your windows without any uh um uh drapes or curtains and I looked into it and I saw your wife I saw your daughter Nobody Does this whenever you walk it's his mistake not having a curtain but if you see something Haram you immediately lower your gaze but nobody goes and knocks on people doors and ask them for forgiveness unless as I said you don't mind a black eye or a broken nose"
