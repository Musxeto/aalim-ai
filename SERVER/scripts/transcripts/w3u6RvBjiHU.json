  "transcript": "As-Salamu Alaikum. Rajdul from India. Sheikh, my question is, is it permissible to apply perfumes that contains alcohol and will our prayers be valid if we pray after applying it? Jazak Allah. Wa Jazakum. So basically speaking, we've answered this before, perfumes that have alcohol are totally prohibited to drink. Because this intoxicates you. Duh! Sheikh, who would drink it? You tell me. Applying it externally is totally permissible. Oh, but it contains alcohol. So what? I'm not drinking it. Don't I use sanitizers? Before I take my shot, don't I use alcohol swaps, I think they call it, or whaps or whatever? There's nothing wrong in using alcohol externally. Whether in perfume or in your clothes or in your body, there's no problem in that, none whatsoever, but don't drink it. This is all the time we have until we meet same time tomorrow. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
