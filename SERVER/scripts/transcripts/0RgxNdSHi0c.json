  "transcript": "Consider Subscribing ğŸ˜„ Sheikh uh [name] from Bangladesh Jazakum Allahu Khairan for giving me the chance,Â \nmy question is sheik,h if I miss any rukonÂ Â  in a salah, is my whole salah invalid or thatÂ \nparticular raka or in the end in in case ofÂ Â  congregation, after completing my salah withÂ \nthe congregation, as I have missed a rukon,Â Â  and I have to fill the rukun, do I haveÂ \nto again do Sujood As Sahu? [Sheikh]Â Â  Okay so we are talking about a follower,Â \nma'mum who's praying in jamaa in congregation,Â Â  and he missed, one of the pillars ofÂ \nsalat, now he's following an imam,Â Â  so let's assume it's dhur prayer he didÂ \nnot recite the Fatiha in the first rakaÂ Â  and he realized this afterwards, after the secondÂ \nraka, third raka, or whatever. After the imamÂ Â  concludes the prayer with salaam, this particularÂ \nindividual's first rakah was invalid, which makesÂ Â  his second third and fourth raka with the imam,Â \nto be actually his first second and third,Â Â  therefore after the imam concludes the prayer,Â \nhe stands up and prays his fourth rakah,Â Â  and before concluding the prayer or afterwards heÂ \nhas to offer to sujud of asahu, preferably afterÂ Â  the salaam because he added something that wasÂ \nnot supposed to be added which is the correctionÂ Â  of his missed invalid first rakah which isÂ \nactually the fifth rakah and Allah knows best"
