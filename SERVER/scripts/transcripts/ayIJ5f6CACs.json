  "title": "I put a najis Finger in my oily EAR, how to clean? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Afzan from India Assalamu Alaikum Wassalamu Alaikum So I got impurity on my hand and I did not wash it immediately and I unintentionally touched my inner part of my ear with impure hands and the inner part of my ear was all oily so while I was washing my ear from impurity some of the water goes inside my ear so how can I wash it? This is overthinking Akhi and this is thinking of najasa and impurity as if it's the plague or a coronavirus it doesn't work like this everything is pure until proven otherwise and certainty is not affected by doubt these are the two golden rules write them down and highlight them and put them wherever you can see if you had impurity on your hands and you touch your ears then you're assuming that the impurity was transferred into your ear if you wash it the amount of impurity is so negligible that the water you used would overwhelm it and even if water entered your ear there's no problem in that it would have removed that impurity"
