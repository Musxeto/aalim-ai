  "title": "Healing or cure is in 3 assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "It is one of the means of healing. The Prophet ﷺ said healing or cure of illnesses is in three. One, a drink of honey. Two, a slash of a cupper. The man who does cupping to extract the rotten and spoiled or bad blood from the back of the neck or the shoulders. Thirdly, cauterization. So, this is not to limit means of healing, rather to state the foundations of healing, the principles of healing in these things. And the Prophet ﷺ did cauterize himself, some of his companions, when it's needed. So, what's not liked is when people do it without any need. The Arabs used to do this as a precaution. Though they're not sick, but they used to do this so that they would prevent any illness from coming in. And this is not recommended and this is what was hated by the Prophet ﷺ."
