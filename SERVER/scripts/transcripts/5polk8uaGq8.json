  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s there are programs in the west europe and america where they have an open day and allow people to come into the masjid and i've seen some of those on videos and it's shameful you see women coming in their shorts or in their uh blouses with their hair uncovered some of them even walk inside the masjid with shoes and masha'allah the uh 24 7 9 11 who are ready to give fatwas so yeah yeah we're walking with shoes on carpet is permissible the prophet prayed wearing his shoes and what about the women uh this is for the muslim the the the the advantage in the and the betterness of the muslims image so we have to compromise this is not permissible these are the houses of allah and they have to be respected if women were to come in to ask about islam to learn about islam they have to be modest they have to be totally covered like muslim women otherwise who cares about them let them out who needs them to know about islam we don't lower the bard we raise the bar and we raise the people to go up to that bar it's not the other way around islam has a standard we cannot go below that standard sharing platform on a conference or a lecture like we see in the west a sheikh is sitting next to a female woman and they're talking and they're giving and they're preaching this is not related to islam no matter how long your beard is would you allow your sister to sit with another man like this exposing her face laughing cracking jokes at least her face is visible to everybody this defies the core of the hijab the purpose of the hijab and coming from people of knowledge or so-called duat is even heinous if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen if you're unable to abide by islam wholeheartedly don't get involved in these devious things especially when people point fingers at you saying that you are our own model you are the one who we learn islam from so if you sit with women then we can sit with women and if you crack jokes with sisters we can crack jokes with sisters and if you go to a night club to give dawah in a discotheque might as well we should do that you are a role model whatever you do people would mimic that and imitate it and you will gain every single sin people caught up with because of you and allah knows best"
