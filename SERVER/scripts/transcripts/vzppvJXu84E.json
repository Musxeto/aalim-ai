  "title": "Should I still worry about the questioning of the grave if I give Zakat & Charity? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Nadeem says, I heard in grave we are accountable for every single penny we had. If I pay my zakat on time and spend in charity, also beside that I help the needy if anyone asks me, and my savings are meager just enough to survive few months without a job. Should I still worry about questioning in the grave, or by paying zakat and doing charity only, I'm safe regarding money? First of all, the issue of questioning is inevitable. Yet, there is a difference, as told to us by the Prophet ﷺ, whether this is a display of your good and bad deeds, or scrutinizing and checking every single point of them. So the general concept of displaying your good and bad deeds, this is nothing to be worried about. Because those who are scrutinized and checked thoroughly into their actions, these are the ones who have to fear and they would be punished afterwards. من نوقش الحساب عذب Therefore, if you do what you're supposed to do, and if you pay your zakat money, and if you give charity, then you are in the clear, you're not spending your money in haram, you're not wasting it in extravagance and things that anger Allah Azza wa Jal, you have nothing to fear. You will be held accountable for where you got the money from and where you had spent it in. But this doesn't mean that you will be punished for that as long as you did not commit anything haram. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me, and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days, and then I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
