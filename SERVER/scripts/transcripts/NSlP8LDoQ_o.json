  "transcript": "B from Pakistan previous support it will be really quick inshallah shik my Dad's friend my uncle lives in Japan I learned that he ran away from Pakistan and also went to jail in Japan perhaps due to Illegal immigration or maybe some other crimes when I stayed at his place in Japan with my daring sister at that time he was probably irregular or didn't use to pray at all shik I didn't observe hijab at that time and also had some Fran or friendly discussions with him and I cannot particularly specify whether me adoring myself at that time was merely to look good for validation or sexually attract opposite gender including my uncle so my question is if he listens to a certain problem of mine and agrees to give me some money as gift for a Halal purpose like paying any painting previous of my own or one of my parents is it the same as taking from someone one has committed Z with if the Bara be intact because what he is giving me because I have friendly association with him no problem in accepting gifts from your own uncle"
