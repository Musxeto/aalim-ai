  "transcript": "Yusuf from the UAE. Sheikh, is it mandatory for me to say, if I'm praising someone, is it mandatory for me to say, Wa laa zafiha wa laa wa laa haqeebu, and if I feel shy, if one feels shy of saying this, is he a kafir? Okay, first of all, is it mandatory? The answer is no. But it is highly recommended. Because this would prevent you from saying something without knowledge. And that's why you're relating this knowledge to Allah Azza Wa Jal. Allah is more knowledgeable of him. When I praise someone I say, brother so and so, he's an excellent brother, he's a trustworthy brother. I wouldn't give such a testimony without saying, Wallahu haseebu, wa laa uzakkihi ala Allah. Allah is his witness and I don't praise him over Allah in the sense that without relating this to Allah's knowledge. But if I did not say that, I wouldn't be sinful insha'Allah, but I would be doing something makrooh. Now if I'm shy of saying it, would that take me out of the fold of Islam? Of course not. Over and over again we say that Islam is not an easy thing that you can come in and come out of as simple as that. So many people are intimidated, are frightened by the concept that they might leave the fold of Islam. So whatever happens, they think, oh, did I say something that I became a kafir? Is this shirk? Is this kufr? And shaitan works them really bad. Such overthinking is one of the ways of shaitan of derailing us and diverting us from the straight path which we have to avoid and Allah azza wa jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
