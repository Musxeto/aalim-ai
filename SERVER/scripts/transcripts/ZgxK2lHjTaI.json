  "transcript": "now she mentions in her second question the hadith where the Prophet says Ali is so awesome I think she's referring to hadith Earthman even a fan when he performed a perfect woudl and then pray 2 rakaats and then he addressed his companions and he said I saw the Prophet as a Sam do the same performing a perfect little praying two Rakas and then he addressed us his companions by saying salallahu alaihe salam whoever does this and prays two rakahs without talking to himself meaning that he doesn't think about worldly issues he's concentrating fully on his prayer Allah would forgive his previous sins the vast majority of scholars conclude that this is referring to minor sins and not major sins even hedge would not erase major sins because major sins require repentance while minor sins do not require repentance though it is highly encouraged but if someone falls into minor sins such as maybe eating with the left hand maybe smoking in some cases may be watching Haram or listening to music all of these are minor sins not that they are all minor shares Alcala here I'm gonna subscribe in OSN no this is not the thing it is minor but don't look at the size of the sin look at who you are sinning against Subhanahu adds origin so these are minor sins if you pray from one prayer to the other this experience minor sins if you go from one humble trauma room experience from one Ramadan to Ramadan expiates major sins like backbiting like fornication like women going out without a job all of these are major sins so they are not forgiven by the previously mentioned good deeds you must repent have remorse quit that send intend not to do it and it's for the sake of allah azza wajal all of these must be included"
