  "transcript": "Adam from France Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu When I make a dua to pass my exams and to get my diploma from the future, I get whispers from Shaitan and I don't know if I'm doing it for Allah or for others. How can I protect myself from instantation? Please, Sheikh. I have no idea what you're talking about. When you're about to get a certificate or a diploma, what is the Shaitan telling you? You will change your social places. Your what? My social places, I don't know the word in English. I will get rich and et cetera. So what's the problem? If you move from this neighborhood to the Champs-Élysées and you go uphill or uptown, what's the problem? I don't know if my perception to others will change, et cetera. So if you have money and you want to buy a better car, you will not buy a better car because you will feel a bit posh and a better person for driving a Mercedes rather than driving a Corolla? No, this is ridiculous, Adam. This is something that you know Shaitan is throwing in your heart. So why do you listen to it? If your enemy comes to you and he says with an orange juice, your Zionist enemy comes to you and says, drink this my friend, this is a very good orange juice. Would you drink it? The answer is of course not. You know he's your enemy. He has killed hundreds of thousands of Muslims, of your brothers and sisters. You don't believe him because he's going to put poison in it. So when Shaitan does the same to you and puts these whispers in your head, is it logical that you listen and you pay attention and you become afraid? You're a person who fears Allah, who fears hellfire. This is why you're asking me, because you're afraid. A hypocrite is not afraid. A person who doesn't love Allah is not afraid. So ignore such whispers and move on with your life and go and get your certificate and buy a new Mercedes and may the things go your way according to what pleases you insha'Allah."
