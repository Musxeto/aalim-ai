  "transcript": "Duda from Tanzania So if you were not pure on the eighth day, what's the problem? But you weren't. No, you're not sinful. You are sinful if the blood stops and you know that you have no menses anymore, no colour discharge, and still you did not go to check whether you're pure or not to pray. But if the menses is on but you are hesitant, hmm, should I go and check or not? And the norm is that on the tenth day you are pure, you have no signs, no indications or evidences to hint that you have become pure. There is no sin at all in this."
