  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I am trying to make my recitation of the Quran much more beautiful So I try to imitate the famous reciters and sheikhs on the YouTube and try to recite the way they recited So most of the times if I am not able to recite a particular ayah I have to repeat it multiple times so that I could imitate it perfectly So I just wanted to know is this disrespectful to the Quran if I read a particular section of the ayah Or just a word multiple times so that I could make it match their way Because I feel it's disrespectful to say a particular word again and again just to make it beautiful So I didn't know about that, just help me with that, Jazakallah Khair There is a difference brother Ammar between repeating an ayah or a word simply because the word you mispronounced So you want to perfect how to pronounce it This is totally permissible and legit What isn't permissible or legit is when you repeat the verse or a phrase or a word just to keep the tone or the way of the imam And you do this so that you mimic his recitation and perfect it This is disrespectful Now it's like singing a song and trying to reach a pitch that you want and you repeat it and repeat it until you perfect it This is disrespectful for the Quran and Allah knows best"
