  "title": "Can a video editor make videos for clients if they add music to it afterwards? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mouhie from Djibouti So, I'm a video editor and I edit videos, YouTube videos for clients and it's about financing and business topics. So most of the clients require music background to be added for the videos. So my question is, if the client himself adds the music to the video after I've done it, I just edit the video without the music so I don't deal with it and then the client either he does it himself or so he hires someone else to add the music to the video. Will my payment for editing the video still be haram? Mouhie, if the content of the video is halal, so if it is dealing with halal stuff, there is no riba, there is nothing endorsing haram or promoting haram and all what you do is just edit it or put subtitles to it or thumbnails or the likes and you give the product back to the owner without collaborating with him or showing him or telling him that this is where you should put the music but I'm not going to put anything because it's haram. If you're not collaborating with him on anything that is haram, what he does with the end product that you've given him which is halal, this is his business and your income is halal insha'Allah."
