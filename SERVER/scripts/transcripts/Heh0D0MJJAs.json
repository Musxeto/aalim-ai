  "title": "People embracing Islam made the Prophet happy assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "There is a change that they can see. For example, when people embrace Islam, revert to Islam, especially when they are part of the elite or the dignitary of Quraysh, the Prophet would be happy because he knows that there will follow them a lot of the people and follow suit. Ikrima, may Allah be pleased with him, he is the son of Abu Jahl, the fierce enemy of the Prophet ﷺ and of Islam. He is the pharaoh of this Ummah. He tormented Muslims, killed them, plotted against Islam, did everything he could till his last breath. Such an enemy, you would hate everything that is related to them and you would have wanted to kill anyone related to them, even their dogs, not the Prophet ﷺ. Ikrima, when he heard of the conquest of Mecca, fled and travelled all the way to Yemen. And his wife travelled to him, trying to convince him to accept Islam and not to fear for his life because whoever comes to the Prophet ﷺ accepting Islam, the Prophet accepts that from him. So, he travelled back to the Prophet ﷺ and accepted and reverted Islam. The Prophet ﷺ was very happy and he jumped to him and gave him his cloak and took the Pledge of Allegiance from him when he came. And this appeared clearly on the Prophet's face. And this shows you that the Prophet ﷺ did not have any hidden agenda. If he were to hate someone, he would have hated the son of Abu Jahl for what he had done. Yet, he was happy for him accepting Islam. Likewise, he was happy when Adiyy ibn Hatim al-Ta'i came and accepted Islam. The Prophet ﷺ smiled in his face and his face was lit when he announced that he came as Muslim."
