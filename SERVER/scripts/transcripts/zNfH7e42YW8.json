  "transcript": "there is a girl she had she had a boyfriend okay and so her guardian her parents are dead her guardian the real uncle he wanted her to get married forcibly like she didn't want to marry that guy so the girl she ran away with the boyfriend and she got married without the real uncle's uh you know consent and then you know the real uncle and all the family members the elders they have said that we don't want to see her she she comes and she says sorry but they don't want to see her they say that you have committed dinner and you ha you know you have crossed the limits of allah so you are dead for us and so they severed the tide of kinship uh my question is that is it allowed even if she did dinner or even if she didn't we don't know because there isn't any like four witnesses to to see the dinner or whatever anyhow so is it allowed to um review the type of kinship uh if she did dinner or even if she didn't that's my question where was that yeah when was that where it was in pakistan okay i will answer inshallah she says that there is this girl in india whom her uncle tried to forcefully get her married and we all know that this is totally prohibited and the marriage is invalid the uncle has no power the brother has no power her son has no power in forcing her to get married to anyone so when everybody in the family stood against her she ran away with her ex-boyfriend or with her current boyfriend i don't know and they got married and now she was she's disowned by the whole family none of them want to see her they are accusing her of zina and um says are they allowed to accuse her of zina when they don't have any evidence first of all what she had done is wrong running away and marrying someone against the will of her family her guardian is definitely prohibited and the marriage is invalid but due to the fact that they are in india which is a predominantly hanafi school hanafi country the law there allows a woman to marry against or let me rephrase that it allows a woman to marry without a guardian and if she's a devout hanafi follower and her husband is a devout hanife follower and they were not involved in any pre-marital sexual intercourse and they got married in an islamic court or an islamic center then the marriage is valid secondly can they accuse her of zina the answer is no and accusing her of zina requires four male witnesses graphically describing what they had seen of a sexual intercourse taking place but if they accuse her of this on the account that they believed that the marriage contract was invalid so their marriage is invalid and they're living in a state of zina this might be a dubious area that each one has his own uh opinion and view of it she must try her level best to rectify this issue and try to explain to them if she can if she cannot then may allah make things easy for her you"
