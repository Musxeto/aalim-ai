  "transcript": "sadika from bangladesh um my question is about researching surah al-qahafi the friday i heard from a guy that the time of recite the time began of reciting surah al-kahf on trustee after the sun set and it ended on friday after the zuma prayer and somewhere else i read that the time end of uh on friday after the sunset now i want to know from when to when if i recite surat tahab it will count as i'm reciting at the friday and i will get the reward as the hadith say so this is an issue of dispute as you've mentioned and the most authentic opinion is that the time to recite suratul kaff is from the break of dawn of friday till the sunset of the same day of friday and not from the sunset of thursday though the sunset of thursday inaugurates the beginning of the day of friday however there is night time and daytime so the surah of surat al-qaf is recommended and we're instructed to recite it on the day of friday not on the night of friday so you you can begin reciting it from the break of dawn from fajr time of friday till the sunset of friday and allah knows best you"
