  "transcript": "Is a woman required to wear her pants above the ankles as well when at home or is she exempted? So the answer would be it is prohibited for men to wear their garments, their trousers, whatever they're wearing from waist downwards, so that it would exceed their ankles. This is prohibited, it's a major sin, it's punishable in hellfire. Whether it's your trousers, your waist wrapper, whether it's your thawb, whatever garment men wear. Because the Prophet ï·º said, whatever exceeds the ankles is in hellfire. So one would say, okay then, why are women exempted? Why aren't they included in this hadith? Because there's another hadith where the Prophet ï·º said to the companions that women must lower their garments by this much. So one said, maybe their feet would be exposed. So then he allowed it to be lowered and extended for a dhira, an arm fold. So this is for women and they're obliged to cover their feet. So they're exempted from the hadith of not exceeding the ankles. And this is the consensus as Imam Nawawi has reported it. May Allah be have mercy on him. He said they all agree they all agree that women are not included in this hadith and that they can lower their garments below the ankles and more.
