  "title": "How to purify items in house after touching a bowl that had Dog Saliva in it? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "fatima from the us um how do i go about cleaning myself and items in my house because i put my hand in a wet bowl that had dog saliva in it and so i proceeded to touch wet laundry took a bath and touched other things with my wet hands without washing them seven times with soil so you you placed your hand in a bowl that had saliva of a dog yes okay i will answer your shabbat u.s she says there was a plate that a dog licked in and she got her hands into it and then she took a shower she made wudo she touched everything so what's the ruling on that it's an issue of dispute between schools of thought i personally without going into details i'm inclined to the fact that only what the dog licked or ate from and form of utensils must be washed seven times with water and once with soil anything else does not require these eight washes it does not require soiling or using soil or or sand or dust or whatever why because the hadith directly addresses the issue of the dog licking in your plate or in your dish or your own or licking your utensils not anything else and the prophet islam at one stage of time his grandson had a puppy in the house and i've mentioned this before jibril refused to enter the house until the puppy was taken out so the prophet did not tell them to wash the whole house and the furniture the ground because there was a puppy which means that your wudu your russell touching things with wet hands afterwards has no impact on the purity of the house"
