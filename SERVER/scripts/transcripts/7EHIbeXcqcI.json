  "transcript": "Medina from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So in Germany there is this thing where we students give each other presents before Christmas and I didn't want to participate but my teacher told me that it is like a must, like I literally talk to her and so my friend told me about like an alternative where I asked the person I got if I could just give them something after this thing, I don't know so the thing is I got like a girl and she's like Christian and I believe she wouldn't accept it and agree to it so I thought about like changing and like just getting like a guy that I'm sure would say yes to like the offer but I'm not sure if that's even possible so Medina, Medina, Medina, if you don't give them a gift what will happen to you? They will kick you out of the school? No like my teacher like we had like a talk and she said like I have to, I don't know You tell me, you tell me, what is the worst that she could do? Put you in jail? No you have to, see we have to have dignity and pride in our religion, we have to draw the line not everything that these disbelievers tell us to do we say yes master and we do it so they say you have to exchange gifts, I don't want to, I don't have money, what are you going to do? Sue me? Kick me out of the school? No, they're going to be upset, the hell with them, let them be upset I have no problem with them being upset rather than upsetting Allah azza wa jal so don't try to bend the rules just to please them say yes and ignore it and don't do it and nothing would happen to you inshallah"
