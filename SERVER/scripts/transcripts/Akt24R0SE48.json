  "transcript": "Raqib from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Mashallah, all the callers are from Bangladesh I don't know, they're getting free calls or what? Huh, what can I do for you Raqib? Sheikh, a few months back I noticed that I'm not being able to work well Like, I was not being able to do anything I was getting tired and I was getting sick too often Depression and all the stuff So, I came to a conclusion that there is something wrong with me And it might be evil eye and be black magic and the likes So, I told you about my condition and you said that it's an evil eye I did Ruqyah and Alhamdulillah I feel much better than before now My question is, can I make Dua to Allah by saying Ya Allah, whatever happened with me, it's the result of someone's ill intention Or someone trying to harm me by doing, by envy, black magic and the likes So, then avenge that person and teach him or them a great lesson No problem in doing that, but to forgive and move on is better for you It's higher for your reward And, I don't know if I said this here or I made a Khutbah Jum'ah or somewhere I'm getting too old to remember There is a difference between envy, which is Al-Hasad, which is a genetic word And evil eye, which is Al-'Ayn Envy or Al-Hasad is usually done with the intent to harm people I see a beautiful card that you have, I envy you You don't deserve it, I wish you lose it, I wish you smash it and have an accident This is ill intent And it's not necessarily that I say this in front of you or to see it Maybe I can be in a different country and know about it and still have envy towards you And this is a major sin Evil eye is not necessarily done with ill intent In most cases, it's done accidentally, without an ill intent However, it is an impact of a person's personality through what he sees That it impacts what he looks at So, a father could give an evil eye to his own son Playing around, look at him, he's like a genie Look how he moves, whoa, he's so strong and boom The son is sick, it's your evil eye You did not say Allahumma Barik I didn't have any ill intent to my son, but it happens So, what you're suffering from, Akhi Raqib Most likely is an evil eye that took place without a person's intending it As long as Ruqya, Alhamdulillah, the grace of Allah alone Cured you, keep on doing the Ruqya And in a couple of weeks time, you'll be all clear And the man or the woman who gave it to you Will, inshallah, move on and hopefully that he would not do it again"
