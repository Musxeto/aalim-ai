  "transcript": "Showell says what are the things that we are allowed to do when visiting graves of relatives you're allowed to make dua for the deceased not for yourself you don't go say oh Allah pay off my debts and get me married soon and help my child pass the exams this is not a place of dua for yourself this is a place for benefiting the deceased in the graveyards and benefiting your heart from remembering that soon I'll be joining them and this means that it reminds you of death and it will make you improve your life insha'Allah"
