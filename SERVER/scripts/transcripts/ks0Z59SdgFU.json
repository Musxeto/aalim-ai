  "transcript": "Rabia from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum. I have a question about if you have any advice for sisters who recently put on Niqab but they are living with non-Mahrams and I accidentally get seen at times. And I was wondering if maybe I should do Turaqat before bed at the end of every day. You have to do what? I was wondering if I should maybe do Turaqat or Tawbah or something at the end of every day. Did you do it intentionally? No. Alhamdulillah, Allah Azza Wa Jal is the most forgiving, most merciful. Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear. So Alhamdulillah, there is no need to pray such Turaqat of Tawbah because you did not sin and Allah knows best. Alhamdulillah."
