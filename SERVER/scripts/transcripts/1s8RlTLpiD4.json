  "transcript": "muhammad from pakistan my father is right under the train and he crushed under the train and uh i am so much sad please pray for him and the question is is he is water or not may allah azzawajal shower his mercy abundantly upon your father and may allah azzawajal expand his grave to be a garden of paradise and may allah azzawajal have all of his sins erased by the calamity he underwent the question is is he considered to be a martyr this is an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars say that he is not because he's not mentioned in the categories where the prophet as assam said there are seven other than those who die on the battlefield that are considered to be martyrs in the cause of allah and he mentioned among them those who die in fire or drowning or collapse building or through a tumor in their stomach or with the uh illness of um the plague or of lung disease etc and a woman who dies well in labor etc so they said that this is not part of them other scholars say no they share the same calamity so a person in a house the house collapses on him he's helpless he cannot do anything he cannot escape and he dies patiently without objecting to allah's decree likewise a person who dies in a car accident or a person who dies under the wheels of a train is in the same category and i pray to allah that he is in the same category so inshallah he is considered to be a shaheed and allah is most merciful as you"
