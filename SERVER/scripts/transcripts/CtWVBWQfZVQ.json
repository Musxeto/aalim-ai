  "transcript": "Brother Aslan from Qatar. The question I have is that what is the ruling of Islam about working for a company that takes interest-based loans for financing of its projects but in a different department inside which is not dealing with such things unlike finance department that involves with bank loan interest? What is the line of this company, Akhi? What is the line of work? Well, it's a different business like utility company, something like that. Okay, I will answer you In Sha Allah. First of all, taking loans to finance your projects is a major sin in Islam. Now those business owners, CEOs, CFOs and those in charge of companies should fear Allah Azza Wa Jal. Getting richer and richer and more successful and focusing on the end of year's bonus and increment will not save you from hellfire. One of the major sins in Islam is dealing in Riba and don't be fooled by the amount of companies worldwide, even the Muslim world, that have no problem in borrowing in Riba and financing their projects in Riba. This is a major sin. So it's in your neck. You will not come on the Day of Judgment and explain yourself to Allah and say, Oh Allah, I was a CEO, the board of directors directed me to do this, I could not do anything else. Akhi, resign. Work as a janitor rather than accepting to facilitate and endorse interest-based Riba. Secondly, if the line of work of the companies, Halal, they work in construction, they work in services, they work in manufacturing Halal things, and it so happens that you work for that company in a Halal department, in the department of premises, in transportation, in procurement, in manufacturing, in operation, in human resources, but not in financing, because you don't do anything, you have nothing to do with Riba. If this is the case, then working for such a company is Halal, even if they finance their projects or deposit their savings in exchange for Riba. Why? Because the sin falls upon the one who's dealing in Riba. Your job, the line of work of the company is Halal. So whatever they're doing and financing their projects by, the sin is on them. Unlike if you're working in IT, or working in HR, or working in procurement for an interest-based bank, a conventional bank, though your job seems Halal, yet the line of work of the institution or the company itself is Haram. Therefore even their drivers and janitors, their earning is Haram, because they're collaborating with the whole system over Haram, which is based all in Riba, and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
