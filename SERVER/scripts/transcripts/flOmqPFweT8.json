  "transcript": "Bint Quraishi from Pakistan. Sheikh, I got a really quick question but I need to know this as I'm stuck here. It's very quick. If everyone has forgotten which year did this woman give some of her gold to her parents to be sold, okay, for the money to be paid to a needy sibling for his debt who was in another country and she intended that as Zikr. So can it be attributed to any previous year if she's completing her Zikr from past years already? JazakAllah. The answer is yes. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
