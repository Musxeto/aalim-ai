  "transcript": "Mir from Bangladesh assalamu alaykum alaykum Salam my academic books all of them contains many name of different persons and most of those name contains names of Allah and Prophets they are usually written in Bengali and if someone disrespects them like throwing them in the bin and knowing that it contains those names is it kufur no it's not kufur first of all because it is not in Arabic the only sacred thing is Allah's beautiful names in Arabic if it's written in other languages it's an issue of dispute it's best not to do that but I I'm inclined to say that there is no problem in that because it's not in Arabic as for the names of Messengers and Prophets and companions that do not have the name of Allah even if written in Arabic there is no problem in throwing that if there is a need to do that"
