  "title": "Sons give their abusive father money but father still says sons are greedy & Allah will punish them",
  "transcript": "yes a father who has oppressed his wife and children and tortured them beat them for nearly 20 years and despite all this their children now have a job and they give some of the money to their father and they keep something for themselves but the father is still angry at them saying that they were greedy they didn't ask for permission where or when they were spending the money and saying and cursing them that they will be held accountable on the day of judgment for not giving enough money and being greedy so my question is sir uh we if the sons tried to please their father and didn't intend to hurt him but the father still curses them are the sons the children really sinful okay first of all as i always say and everyone knows this everyone on earth is tested it so happens that allah is testing you with such a father with such a parent may allah make your test and ours easy now you are obliged to obey allah whether this father is a sweetheart or a villain it doesn't matter what matters is that you obey allah if he was a sweetheart there wouldn't be any test but because he's a villain or he's bad or he's evil or he's unappreciative this is where your test is at its best so you have to be dutiful to him respectful obedient when it comes to giving him money if he's poor and needy you must give him and your siblings combined to what makes him above poverty line to what suffices him not to make him live a lavish life or to live in a mansion or to buy sports cars no give him what is sufficient to maintain a dignified and honorable life you are not obliged to provide for his second family and his children you're only obliged to provide for your father if he's rich you don't have to give him a single penny if he's self-sufficient you don't have to give him a single penny if he makes dua from today till the day of judgment his dua is unheard because he's the oppressor he's the one who's transgressing in his demands regardless if he's evil or a sweetheart it doesn't make any difference so the problem is am i doing my due diligence am i doing my duty to him if he is not in need i don't have to give him anything even if he demands it and even if he curses me if i don't do it so remain with him being kind beautiful obedient and respectful and follow what i had told you it's only a few days and he will mate he will meet your maker his maker and you also will meet your maker but you have done everything that allah has ordered you to do in sharia without any problem in sha allah you"
