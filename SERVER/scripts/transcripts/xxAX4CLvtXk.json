  "title": "What can I do other than be a keyboard warrior for the G3n0side in Palestine? Will I be sinful?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, what is my responsibility as an ordinary Muslim who has no influence in society at hard times like this when there is genocide against the Muslims? Will I be punished on the day of judgment and what can I do to ease the pain or just be a keyboard warrior? What are your options when you have a question? The best way to solve problems is to examine and explore your options and put six or seven options on the table and then evaluate. The brother gave one option which is keyboard warrior and I used to call them keyboard knights with a cape. What are the keyboard knights? Someone who hides behind the screen and starts slaughtering people and these are cowards, these are traitors, the ruler of this country is this, they're being paid and they're all this and they're Jews and they're, who are you? Anonymous. Be brave and show us your face. Reveal your name. No, I'd rather fight from behind the lines. No, this is cowardice and this is not from Islam. We do not have many options because we are ordered to follow the Quran and the Sunnah and to obey our Muslim rulers. So what we have in our possession is quite limited. Number one, dua. Now seriously, seriously, seriously, those who always, yeah and excuse my French, bitch and whine about what's genocides happening. What amount of dua do they do per day? Seriously, a lot of the people I ask, they said, we don't. Yeah, you should devote your night prayer if you fear Allah and feel sorry for your brothers and sisters to make dua every single night before Fajr. Raise your hands in your sujood but if you don't and all what you want is fighting and blowing up people, no, this is not Islam. So dua is number one priority and Allah will eventually make a way out for them. The same genocides was in the 1990s. You remember those? Most of you don't. Yeah, only the old guys remember 1990s when Bosnia-Herzegovina was under attack by the Serbs and this was real genocides and slaughtering and we made dua day and night and Allah Azza wa Jal satisfied us to see them victorious and liberated and we anticipate the same to happen inshallah. Number two, financial aid. Alhamdulillah, here you're capable of donating and there are real sincere Muslims who will go an extra mile to deliver your donations to the needy and to those who are unprivileged. So Alhamdulillah, Allah gave you some, give. Number three, make their plight alive on social media to the best of your ability. Send messages within the Islamic parameters. Don't send shots of Muslim men, women, children being maimed, injured, suffering. This is not halal. How dare you send my picture when my guts are all out and I'm dying and you say, oh look at what they're doing to our Muslim Sheikh. This is not halal. I have my respect, I have my honor and dignity to be protected. Not just because they're being bombarded like this, you make it easy to send these pictures. No, make their plight alive. Show the atrocities. Nowadays, Alhamdulillah, there are so many people online. Some of them we do not approve of their Islamic way of refuting the Zionists. But they come, they make fun of them, they give facts, they show that these are terrorists and these are occupiers and they are inhumane. And they're famous on the web. They're intellectuals, lawyers or comedians, but they make a good point. So if it's Islamic, if it's halal, spread the word. Make the whole world notice so that Alhamdulillah, we gain momentum. And there are many, many ways you can help, but you have to be sincere and seek Allah's help and guidance and Allah will guide you."
