  "title": "If I Cheat in Exams & get a Job based on this degree, will my income be haram? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh samira says if i cheat in exams and pass and i get a job based on this degree will my earnings be haram this is a frequently asked question by a lot of the brothers and sisters and unfortunately it seems that there is a possibility of this becoming a trend where people find the audacity to cheat during exams without any problem and this is in islam problematic the prophet said whoever he cheats us is not from among us however the issue of earning is different than the issue of cheating on a certificate or in an exam so if you cheat in an exam or more and you get the degree based on such cheatings and you apply for a job they interview you they give you a couple of tests and you are awarded this position is your earning halal or haram this has nothing to do with your degree the sin you committed while having these exams is there now the the the job itself where you're getting this earning from is dependent on your job description and your evaluation and if you are fulfilling what you're supposed to do in such a position or not this is what you're getting paid for not on your degree so let us assume that you've been awarded a position as a secretary if you're doing the filing well the taking the appointments well you're writing in shorthand letters of your superiors or your boss and you're doing everything and exceeding what you're supposed to be doing and everybody is happy the earnings are halal but you're sinful for what you had cheated in during acquiring your degree this is different than forging a degree because it's a prerequisite that you have a degree in order to take the job so if you forge a degree you don't have a ba or a bs or a master's degree and you forge one you paid for it and you got it without any studying without any cheating without anything you bought it off the streets now this the earnings are haram even if you excel in your position because this is a prerequisite for your position on allah knows that"
