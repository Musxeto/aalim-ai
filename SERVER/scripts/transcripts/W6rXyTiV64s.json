  "transcript": "malika's second question what's the ruling on organ donations well first of all blood donation there's no problem in that it is prohibited to sell blood but to donate it whether to Muslims or non-muslims as long as they're not combatant you do not go to an a kafir or a non-muslim army and you do not donate blood to them there are enemies in their combatant against Islam so you don't do this now when it comes to organ donations while alive if donating this organ does not harm me and it can reproduce itself I think liver if you donate part of it it reproduces itself and there's no harm on your medical condition if you donate a kidney for example and you have two or three of them and it would not affect you the vast majority of scholars say that this is okay now talking about donation after death the scholars have disputed upon this a great portion of them say that this is permissible I personally say that or believe that the scholars who said it is prohibited or correct why because the corpse of a Muslim deceased has its honor and dignity and we must not violate this for donation said yeah but there are people who will die they will eventually die may Allah have mercy on them but I would not allow anyone to cut me open after my death to take my kidneys or liver or heart for other people because this goes against the teachings of Islam where the Prophet says are some the breaking of a deceased or a corpse bone is like breaking it when he's alive so it has his sanctuary it has its sacredness and it must not be violated and Allah knows best"
