  "title": "Is it permissible to get married to people from different nationality as long as they are Muslims?",
  "transcript": "Is it permissible for two people from different countries to get married if they are Muslims? And what is the ruling of the parents who don't agree? What do the parents say except for one person and that is the father of the girl. He's the guardian and his decision makes it or breaks it. So if everyone on earth agree that these two get married and the father of the girl says no, there is no marriage valid. Yes, I can take care of her. I don't need anyone's opinion. The marriage is valid."
