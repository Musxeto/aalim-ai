  "transcript": "[Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam the way of the prophet and the way of his companions may Allah be pleased with them all of how to rebuke mistakes and errors and sins how to fix them is a Cornerstone in our lives so that we could learn and adapt such methodologies when we tackle similar situations and scenarios because their way is the best way if not the only way now part of the tips and hints before fixing people's mistakes and errors that we have to acknowledge and know is that the intention of an individual who makes a mistake does not stop us from correcting his mistakes or forbidding evil and vice when it takes place there's a famous Hadith that shows us how the companions the best students of the Prophet Alat may Allah be pleased with them dealt with such intentions I'm says we used to sit at the door of Abdullah Mas may Allah be pleased with him and whenever he goes to prayer to the Masjid we walk alongside him asking him learning from him once Abu mus may Allah be pleased with him came and said did Abu rman come out referring Tob Mas so we said no not yet so he waited with us though he's a companion and a friend of IB masud he did not knock on the door he waited patiently with the other students until Abdullah came out so Abu mus addressed him and said oh Abu ABD rman I was in a Masjid and I saw something I did not like though I did not see anything harmful but it wasn't something that I knew of so Abdullah Mas said what did you see so Abu Musa said I saw a circle of people with a man sitting in the middle they were waiting for the prayer to be called for and the Man in the middle alongside with these people had pibbles in front of them so the man would say say Allah abbar 100 times so they start to count on the pibbles allahar allahar Allah abbar and then he said say 100 times say Subhan Allah 100 times so abdah asked mus what did you say to them Abu Musa said I didn't say anything I just came to ask you for your verdict and opinion of what they're doing so Mas says why did you not tell them to count their bad deeds and guarantee them that nothing of their Good Deeds would be wasted and he went along with Abu Musa to this Masjid and once he came and stood by one of these circles he asked them what are you guys doing of course they all know who Abdullah is so they said oh Abu ABD rman we are counting on these Pebbles the the the so he again said said to them count your sins for I guarantee for you that none of your good deeds would be wasted shame on you followers of Muhammad members of the umah of muhammmad sallallah alai wasam how fast you are to your destruction around you the companions of the prophet am are available the prophet's clothes are not yet worn out he just recently died his utensils and plates are not broken by the one whose hand is My Soul by the one in whose hand is my soul either you are following a way that is more more guided than the way of Muhammad Alat wasam or you're opening a door of misguidance it can't be a third way either you know more than the prophet and his companions that's why you're innovating this or you're opening a door for misguidance and Innovation so they defended themselves saying by Allah oh Abu ABD we only wanted to do good and this is the punchline the intention he said how many of those who wanted to do good failed to achieve it the messenger of Allah peace be upon him sallallahu alaih wasallam told us that people recite the Quran it does not go any further than their throats by Allah I do not know maybe most of them are people like you the prophet was referring of course to the K who recite the Quran to the extent that we feel ashamed of the effort they're putting in reciting the Quran and in their prayers that we look down upon ourselves yet the prophet wasam said that it does not exceed their throats and they are the hounds of Hellfire and and that they are the worst of people under the skies IB Mas said I don't know maybe the most of them are people like you who narrated this story says and on the day of Nan when the fight was with thear between the Muslims and the karage he says the vast majority who were in The these circles were among the now what do we understand we understand that most people who do mistakes they do them with a good intention actually if you look at the innovators if you look at the people who do things that are not part of Islam they they would tell you that they are sincere the Deviant sects and Cults they may have sincerity not only that even the Jews and the Christians may have sincerity however in Islam the Quran and the Sunnah direct us that there are two major and Main Concepts that must be fulfilled in order for any of our Deeds to be accepted by Allah number one sincerity they were not instructed other than to worship Allah with sincerity and the first question to be asked what were you worshiping so sincerity is an essential part without it Allah does not accept your Deeds because you're you're worshiping someone else and the second main concept that must be fulfilled is compliance with the way of the prophet and this is what I testify that Prophet Muhammad Alam is Allah's servant and messenger actually means when we say what does this mean it means that I believe him in whatever he he tells us and I worship Allah only by what he had instructed us and I I obey him in whatever he orders us and that Allah is not worshiped except by his way by the way he taught usat these two conditions are essential and you as a Muslim you have to audit your life if you're worshiping Allah but you're innovating you're doing things that were not mentioned in the Quran nor in the Sunnah what are you doing said I'm worshiping Allah Allah knows that my intention is pure your intention is not sufficient this Hadith is Crystal Clear start counting your bad Deeds your good deeds will not be missed Allah will count them for you but your bad Deeds is what you should be at the lookout for so many of the Muslims nowadays do innovation small and large sometimes XX large so some of the Innovations take them out of the fold of Islams some of the Innovations are major sins but they're still Muslims the sad thing is that Allah blocks them from repenting because they see themselves doing a good thing why would I Repent you go to inovator this is Haram what you're doing this congregational Dua is Haram the celebrating of the m is an innovation this form of you're innovating is all not part of Islam and he says it's okay I know it's what's in the heart that counts not knowing that Allah does not accept Deeds that are not in compliance with the Sunnah the prophet saidat that every whoever innovates in a religion what's not part of it this is rejected it will be thrown in your face and Allah would not accepted on the day of judgment so be careful and look at what you're doing secondly before making a correction of a mistake or an error or forbidding something that's sinful or vice we have to be fair and just and being fair and not being biased when correcting those who make mistakes this is an essential part of our religion Allah says in the in the Quran and when you judge between people to judge with Justice so you cannot be biased you cannot favor one over the other usam may Allah be peace with and with his father Z we know that the prophet loved z a lot to to the extent that he adopted him as a son and he was a slave given Byam may Allah be pleased with him to his aunt Khadijah our mother the wife of the Prophet Alam and Khadijah saw how much the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was fond of this young smart boy so she gave this this slave to him and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam freed him set him free and said he is from today ZN Muhammad he adopted him when adoption was permitted in the beginning of Islam then it was arreated the prophet loved him as a son and when he had a son called him Usama the prophet loved Usama as a grandon so he was so close to the prophet Alam he was all the time around the prophet Alam alongside alassan and Hussein the actual grandchildren of the Prophet Alat they loved them all he loved them all one day a woman from qur from the reputable tribe from Ben makum she used to borrow utensils and deny borrowing them and that was a form of stealing so they complained to the prophet Alam and the prophet sallallahu Ali wasallam judged that her hand to be cut off and this is the prescribed punishment to people who steal and the people of qur worried about this verdict and wanted a way out so they thought there's no one closer to the prophet alai wasam than Usama so they spoke to Usama and Usama being a young man went with all sincerity and honesty to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to speak and intercede and he spoke to him so that he may change the verdict the prophet was outraged and he said are you interceding concerning one of the punishments prescribed by Allah Usama uh realized his grave mistake and he said oh prophet of Allah ask Allah for forgiveness for me when it was evening the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam went to the Masjid and delivered the sermon and he praised Allah Asel as usual and then he said the people who came before you were destroyed because if one of their nobles stole they would let him go but if one of the weak among them stole they would carry out the punishment on him by the one in whose hand is my soul if Fatima B Muhammad if my daughter Fatima were to steal I would cut off her hand now this shows us the fairness of Islam and how we should adapt this in how we deal with others yes when we say a mistake or a sin we rebuke it we we forbid evil we try to correct it but why when my brother does it I look the other side the other way why when one of my relatives does it why when one of my friends does it I tend to have some leniency with a stranger I'm firm and I stop such evil and I correct such mistakes but when it's someone I know I tend to cut them some slack this is not part of the Islamic way and this shows that there is a deficiency and an error that must be corrected and fixed before it backfires on our DAW and on our sincerity we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back the"
