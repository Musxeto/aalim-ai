  "transcript": "uh abdul hamid says what's the definition of currency in islam this is a detailed answer which usually requires an expert to explain and give a background to it but generally speaking scholars say that originally currency in islam as before the time of islam was dependent on gold and silver so the vast majority of not the vast majority everyone on earth used to trade using gold and silver and it was accepted currency to have transactions done with now this later on changed when bank notes were introduced and to my recollection bank notes were originally introduced in italy where people used to give money to merchants for safe keeping and the merchants who had like benches or bank codes or whatever it is called used to give them a note stating that they have in their possession xyz amount of gold for this individual later on if i for example gave 100 grams of gold to the merchant and he gave me a note stating that he holds 100 grams for me later on instead of buying something with gold i used to give this 100 gram worth of note to purchase a property or to purchase something of value and that banknote started circulating among the people and they're accepting it to be something of value why because it was backed by that merchant who had the gold or the silver in his possession as time progresses countries started to adopt the same concept in the sense that countries issued currency dollar the mark the yen the frank the krona the real the durham the dinar where it used to be written underneath it that the government owes the better of this bank note of this currency an x amount of silver or gold depending and people accepted that recently government started cheating and they started printing these currencies without having actual gold or silver to back it up depending on their own financial reputation and their own economy which led to inflation which led to so many catastrophes unfortunately nevertheless the jurors agreed upon themselves that a the definition of a currency is whatever the people agree among themselves to have a value so if in a village or a community they all agree that a piece of marble costs a kilogram of carrots for example and they started dealing with these marbles accepting it to be something of value in this case this is the definition of currency but it has to be agreed upon the people and the community and allah azzawajal knows best you"
