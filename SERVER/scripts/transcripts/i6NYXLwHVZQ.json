  "title": "Will the Angels enter my room if I donâ€™t have any pics in my room but there ARE pictures in my house",
  "transcript": "we from india says nowadays our homes have a number of rooms so for example if in the living room we have portraits or pictures of individuals of or of living creatures we know that the angels do not enter such a room or such a house but what about my bedroom where there is nothing in there so is this considered to be a separate chamber a separate house the answer is yes insha allah this is separate from that room but it is not an endorsement to hang portraits or photos or pictures or drawings of living creature in a single room because this is a sin by itself so you don't get to go down the aisles in a supermarket and choose and pick whatever you want this is a religion of allah it's a package deal that you have to take it embrace it and follow it not to make taylor make your own religion by saying okay i'm gonna skip this i'm gonna take that no this is not the right way of doing it"
