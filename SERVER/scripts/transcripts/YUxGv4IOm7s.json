  "transcript": "Rakeb from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I've been following you for quite a long time now. You say in your videos that kufr and shirk are things related to conviction and Allah does not hold a person accountable for his ignorance and mistakes. But recently I came across a video of yours where you said that whether knowingly or unknowingly, whether intentionally or unintentionally, if a person jokes about Islam, then he's out of the fold of Islam. So how is that possible? And I'm confused about it. Akhi, joking about Islam means that there is no reverence, no glorification, no praising of Allah and of Islam in the heart. Otherwise a person would never ever joke. So this is why scholars say that according to verse 65 and 66 in chapter 9, Surah At-Tawbah Do not apologize. You've committed an act of apostasy and disbelief after being believers because you've mocked and ridiculed Allah Azzawajal, his verses, his signs and the Prophet Alayhi Salatu wa Salam. So there is a difference between committing kufr or shirk unknowingly, which is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that Allah Azzawajal does not hold people accountable for what they've done before sending a messenger to inform them that this is wrong. There is a difference between this and this is an issue known by al-udhru bil-jahl, the excuse through ignorance. They don't know. If this ignorance did not intercede for them, why would Allah say, وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولَهُ We would not torment a nation before sending them a messenger because once a messenger is sent, they have no excuse. So the knowledge is there. But without a messenger, Allah would not hold them accountable to their kufr and disbelief and they will be tested on the day of judgment. Unlike people who ridicule, who make fun, who joke about Islam and things related to Allah or to the Qur'an, this shows they have no reverence, no ta'zeem, no glorification of Allah and his religion. And this is what caused them to do such a heinous sin that takes them out of the fold of Islam."
