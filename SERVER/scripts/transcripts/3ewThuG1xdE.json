  "transcript": "uh Maher from Bangladesh uh I see that urine is uh in my floor now I shall I Far From Evolution again and I was my credit card where do you see the urine in my inner throat did you did you urinate or you saw it later on okay so this is a frequently Asked question that brother Maher has asked about that is after a person urinated they tend to check after half an hour 15 minutes maybe less maybe immediately and the checking varies some of them put some tissues some of them go into squeezing their private part and both ways are not from the Sunnah and it opens the door for OCD when a person sits on a toilet seat and he does his thing and he waits for a minute or two and there is no dripping nothing is coming out so he's looking and there's nothing coming out without contracting his muscles without squeezing anything naturally there's nothing coming out what you should do is pour water on your private parts until it's damped and sprinkle some water on your underwear and lift it up and move the moment you stand you may feel that oops maybe something came out let me check don't check foreign the moment you raise your foot to the sink you get a feeling something came out don't check the wall will you walk to the Masjid do you feel something came out you bow in Salat you prostrate you think something is coming up what is this what is this are you dripping all the time this is shaytan messing up with you no don't don't check whenever you get this feeling just convince yourself this is this was the water I sprinkled on my underwear and I damped my private part with and if you do this no checking for four or five days you will never get this feeling again it will totally disappear because shaytan gives up but if you go and feel weak and say after two hours three hours let me check it will go back to the Vicious Circle again it will hit you harder than before so this is my advice and Allah Knows Best thank you"
