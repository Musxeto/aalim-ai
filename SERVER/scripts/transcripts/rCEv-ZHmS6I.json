  "transcript": "Brother Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How's it going today? Doing great Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. So Sheikh, what I wanted to ask you today was is it part of the sunnah if you're a man to roll up your sleeves and to unveil a couple of other pieces of clothing when it starts to rain so that the rainwater could fall on your body? JazakAllah Khairan. It was reported in the authentic sunnah that whenever rain started pouring down the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam would go out and expose his body to some of that water and saying it is recently close to Allah Azza Wa Jal and he seeks Barakah and blessings of Allah through that. So yes, it is part of the sunnah to get some of that rain on your body without harming yourself. And this is a sunnah, it's not something that is mandatory."
