  "transcript": "Alima from France I just observed that I that some things and some situation are getting very worse. So for example ambushment of past sins by some people which is now leading to my insecurities in the city I am living presently but have been reassuring myself that it is not what life has given me that matters it is the improvement in my religion that matters seeking knowledge from you and learning Arabic language and so on so please I would like to have more advice to be able to be more focused in the hereafter rather than this dunya or what people are doing to me because of the harbishment of my past sins by some people which is now leading to my insecurities in this city so and for an this is this is too long Halima this is something is not related to questions and answers this is related to a session related to a lecture but in a nutshell everyone on earth and I've said this a hundred times to you is being tested whether by bullies or whether by relatives who remind them of their past and their previous sins or whether by neighbors and colleagues who keep on taunting them this is a test from Allah Azza wa Jal you cannot leave everything and focus on acquiring knowledge and Arabic because you have to make a living and when you don't have people to support you and father is not supporting you and your siblings are demanding things from you it's next to impossible to devote yourself to such a mission so you have to strike the right balance where you can secure your financial needs and be financially independent to the minimum but at the same time devote some time to acquiring knowledge learning Arabic improving yourself and making a lot of dua and sujood that Allah takes care of you and protects you and guide you this is the only way forward"
