  "transcript": "zaid zubair says is growing the beard and keeping our garments above the ankle rajib or they are just sunnah someone told us that a man came to the prophet salaam to abide by uh only the five pillars of islam when the man left the prophet said allah if he is true he'll enter jannah he did not tell him about growing the beard and so on please help me out well this is a great misunderstanding and unfortunate um confusion that many of the laymen tend to circulate among the people to justify themselves shaving their beards and probably wearing long trousers the hadith of the nomad who came to the prophet asking him about islam so he asked about the five pillars or the four so the prophet told him about the shahadah the prophet isaiah also told him about the prayer the prophet told him about fasting and he did not to my recollection tell him about hajj which is a pillar of islam and when you look at the hadith you will find that it highlighted the pillars of islam not all what is included in islam in terms of do's and don'ts so by the logic of these people talking to you zed if i were to say that hitting my parents and beating them up is okay because the prophet isam did not mention it in this hadith and he said that he will be truth successful and he will enter paradise if he was saying the truth so does this make any sense of course not and if a person also claims that all what is prohibited in islam it's okay to make as long as i just pray and fast ramadan and maybe give zakat because the prophet says he has said the truth if he succeeded and likewise everything that is mandatory in islam other than the prayer and fasting would be discluded i would be disregarding it because the hadith did not mention it no one says this in islam at all no one at all said this all what they said was this is the minimum requirement for entering paradise so yes you may just pray five times fast ramadan gives a cat maybe perform hajj once in a lifetime but if you do any sin if you abandon anything that is mandatory such as being dutiful to your parents such as not harming your neighbors honoring your guests being kind to your wife being fair with your wives and your children connecting your next of kin without severing it all of these if someone does not do them or does something that is haram he will be punished in hell at ten years a thousand years allah knows how long inevitably he will end up in gender because he's a muslim for doing these minimal acts which were prayer fasting etc but it does not at all have to do anything with whether drawing the beard and keeping the trousers above the ankles are mandatory or recommended sunnah so to answer your question shaving the beard is totally prohibited by the four schools of thought the prophet isa salaam all of these words are verbs of order telling you to let go honor leave not touch in a sense and all of these are in order form it's like when your father says go and fetch me my keys and you're playing video games and you say yeah yeah sure and you continue and he says didn't you hear what i say he says yeah i heard and you continue what do you expect to happen he will spank you he will beat the heck out of you you have no justification to say that why are you hitting me i thought that you were telling me if you wish if you want go and get me the keys but this is not an order no no one says this once the prophet tells you to do something this is a must unless there is another evidence reducing it from mandatory into recommended therefore it is mandatory likewise when the prophet are threatens those who wear their trousers or garments underneath to exceed the ankle level by saying that it is in hell it is punishable in hell fire this is not intimidating you or please think about it this is a promise if you do this you're going to be burnt into in hell because of it of such a sin so i hope this answers your question"
