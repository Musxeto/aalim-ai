  "transcript": "from Bangladesh alayum when I was in school I used to take private tution under a teacher my parents used to pay for this since I didn't earn but my mom did not pay one month's fee because she had some reason which I did not find reasonable now that I have some money with which I want to buy an online course I was wondering is it obligatory for me to use this money to pay off that old debt to that teacher okay it is a debt on you and you have to pay off that money whether your mom has a legitimate reason or not this is something you don't know of so this is one of the rights of that teacher if you don't want to be called on the day of judgment and held accountable for that"
