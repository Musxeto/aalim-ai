  "transcript": "[Music] from the us so my question is how to give dawah to someone who's like against people who like it's not really against but it doesn't really accept the fact that people had yet to like quran and sunnah and it used to be really against that but now i have the light starting to like soft enough but when you try to give him dawah directly he's going to be on defensive and he won't really listen to what you're trying to say but due to like the way the children like treating him being kind to him it kind of like softened up so do you think they should continue to be kind to him and just like give him that way here and there sometimes and not to like focus on like just talking to him like so how do you think this should approach him okay i'll answer inshallah lotiva from the us says how to give dawah to someone who whenever talked to about quran sunnah he it repels him now he's a bit softer before he used to reject it altogether now he's a little bit softer how to approach him this is too generic latifah there is no one size that fits all some we have to look at their own personality some people when you remind them of hellfire they are intimidated and it works others they don't like that other people when you remind them of jannah and paradise they love that and they're drawn to islam others don't care so you have to look at the person and what makes him click most of the time if you talk to people about allah azzawajal about his beautiful names and attributes about his majesty and let them ponder upon this universe how huge it is and how negligible it is compared to allah this opens a lot of people's chests because there is nothing more beautiful in this universe than allah and nothing opens the hearts more than to talk about allah so if you have strong akida strong knowledge strong command over the understanding of the beautiful names of allah and his attributes you may try that you"
