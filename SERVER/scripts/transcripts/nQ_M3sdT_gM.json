  "transcript": "aisha from saudi uh shiv my question is i'm a working woman and uh sometimes it's hard for me to pray more soon so can i do uh uh i can offer like i offer fed but sunnah more can i do after coming back home even if it is if the time has passed the default is that you pray the highly recommended voluntary prayer before or after a particular prayer within the times of the prayer itself when it begins and before it ends however there is an authentic hadith narrated by um may allah be pleased with her that the prophet allah once prayed two raka's and she said oh prophet of allah you prohibited us from praying after asir and now you're praying this voluntary prayer he said the envoy of so and so tribe came at the time and i was sitting and delegating and talking with them until the time expired and i could not pray the sunnah that was post so now i'm making it up and this means that if you have a legitimate reason and you can't pray it on time you can make that up in sha allah knows best you"
