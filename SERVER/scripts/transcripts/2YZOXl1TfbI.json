  "title": "Can you raise your hands when making general Duas mentioned in a hadith",
  "transcript": "Hamza from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Can you raise your hand when you say the dua Question Is this a prescribed dua or a general dua that was mentioned in the hadith? A general dua? So, any general dua, you can raise your hands and say it, without any problem. If it was part of the adhkar of morning and evening, I would say don't, because when the Prophet said it, alayhis salatu wasalam, he never raised his hands. But if it's a general dua, for example, I'm sitting in the masjid, the adhan is called, and between the time of the adhan and the iqamah, I have enough time to make dua, I raise my hand and say this dua. I say any dua that is nice and not prescribed at a particular time, with a particular format, rather it's a general dua. No problem raising your hands."
