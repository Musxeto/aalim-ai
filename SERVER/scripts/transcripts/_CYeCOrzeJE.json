this time we have we are facing at the minute assalamu Lacrosse global Akito most welcome to the show we're very happy with you here barakallahu vekoma it's my pleasure to be with you guys allahumma Ameen jazakallah here i was very happy when i attended the course with you and dad Academy and I'm really really happy with the course and your performance jazakallah here bar like a lot of people so the topic today is calamity in disease what do you wanna tell us about it there is the traditional approach which is what most scholars students of knowledge preachers people of religion remind the congregation of and that is the purpose of life itself and this is what the entire humanity the entire Ummah is in deep need of you see we have been lived in for so long we are acquainted with all those favors and blessings upon us to a degree that we are neglectful of expressing gratitude to it we seem to take everything that we have for granted meaning that yes I am entitled to be healthy I'm entitled to be wealthy I'm entitled to have children and a happy life to have food on the table to have a roof amazed my head and we take these things for granted neglecting why Allah had created us nobody thinks about ok what is my job description I'm a banker I'm an official in the government I'm a businessman ok this is not your job description this is what you are doing at the moment but what is your prerogative what is your target what is your objective in life to become rich to be wealthy to be healthy to be famous to have authority to live a normal life this is not an objective this is short term objective it ends as soon as what you wanted to achieve is achieved for your deprived from achieving it okay so your long-term objective is as a Muslim Jenna yes eternity this is what where I'm headed to 960 years old how long do you think you're gonna live maybe a hundred years more then what yeah so inevitably what counts is what is your destiny are you gonna end up in paradise or you gonna end up in hell so when we are afflicted with calamities with illnesses with disease with natural disasters with anything in life this is the fork of the road because we're a believer differs from disbelievers hmm so if you look at the calamity we're all in the same boat yeah we get the corona virus or the cupboard 19 we fall sick we're hospitalized or we are bedridden for seven eight days we see death with our own eyes and then Allah wills it and we recover what is the difference between a Muslim and a non-muslim a Muslim throughout the whole process knows that this is from Allah and due to his own sins and shortcomings and that a large they were gel is cleansing him purifying him yes a non-muslim curses swears complains whines mm-hmm because he doesn't know what is happening and why me and subhanAllah this is exactly what abdullah IBN masud may allah be pleased with him said I mean he said that you people look at a disbeliever he's addressing the Muslims of course yes okay so he's telling them you look at the disbeliever and you find him one of the healthiest in his body hmm yet his heart is one of the sickest suppose the Muslim has a very healthy heart that remembers Allah that repents that is filled with remorse over his shortcomings but his body is not as healthy okay MMS Road says by Allah if your bodies were healthy and your hearts were sick kalapa would neglect you and not pay attention to you as if you are beetles walking on the ground not the new and the Beatles John McCartney talking about the Beatles themselves because these are insects that nobody pays attention yes so if we mustard is telling us listen I'm not created you for a purpose now is the time to reflect salman al-farisi may allah be pleased with him and me went to visit a sick person and he found him lying on his bed and he said have the glad tiding because the illness of a believer is an expiation and a means of purification of his sins yes well the illness of a disbeliever is like a camel whom the owner ties it to a pole or to a tree and then sets it loose the camel doesn't know why it was tied and why it is it was set loose Muslims believe and this is the most important lesson to be learnt from calamities and diseases that you are in a test when you are at University and the professor gives you a four-page question test and you look and you can't understand that the word is it why are you doing this to me and he smiles and says this is the result of the past four months I've been teaching you you've been sleeping you've been skipping class now is the real test and you say but but why everybody passes why me hmm and this is the untraditional way of looking at calamities and diseases yeah that really you will find people address yeah so I could go on for another half an hour remaining but well you would like me to address the untraditional way this is up to you we will but I just needed to clarify with you you said the Muslim never carries never wine um but we do find Muslims who do curse entwined and complain and sometimes their faith is not it's a bit shaky is it not the case it is definitely the case okay you see and this is the untraditional way how can you drag me into it so I have to I have to we would say this is nice lead to it okay okay now any Muslim on earth mm-hmm ask them what are the articles of faith on piano amen yes it says unto me Nabila well um we'll go to B or o slowly or you will Heidi Heidi he was already to believe in Allah in the day of judgment in Allah as messengers and and divine books and the angels and in the divine decree whether good or bad yeah now this last article we have a big big problem mm-hmm and this is why we have so much stress anxiety attacks we have rage we have confusion we have depression because the last article of faith has been neglected now I am assuming not a Muslim and I'm tuned to your podcast or to your youtube or at your Facebook and I'm seeing this were happy Arab cleric from big beard he's ugly hell man Pilate hell is it's not ugly but yeah this is the expression the English yes don't quote me and Sue me afterwards I know you guys there who loves me [Laughter] and so he comes it says okey what is this who's this man talking to us alive why is he doing what he's doing he's talking about calamities and diseases why should we suffer I don't want to suffer so he starts to object as it whoops sorry okay this is not for you this is for Muslims so what's your difference between Muslims and non-muslims you're segregating if you are promoting hate speech hey wait wait hold your horses my friend who's doing any of this all what I said was Muslims believe in the sixth article of faith mm-hmm now one of the manifestation of such belief we never asked why hmm who is the one who did this meant preordained it Allah this believer says why did he do that mm-hmm said okay then you have a big big problem which requires us to go back with you to square one okay are you an owner or someone who's all owned said know about owner I have a house I have a car I have a job I have a bank account and I own everything not true do you own your consciousness when you fall asleep and you can't help it no can you stay awake for like 72 hours number seven you drop and sleep yeah can you stop your heart from beating no or the blood in your veins from flowing no can you stop copied 19 from attacking you or attacking any of your loved ones obviously then you are not an owner you are not an owner you are a slave you're a servant you do not choose what you want to be or where you wanna be or when death is gonna come to you this is chosen for you so first of all you have to acknowledge number one who you are okay your place okay so okay yeah but I don't believe in God okay this is a big problem why because I don't see him okay do you see corona virus covered 19 do you see it no do you believe in it you bet I do that's why I'm staying home for the past couple of weeks not willing to go out using sanitizers all day long not speaking to people except with having the face mask on my face subhanAllah if you believe in something you don't see yeah because you see the effect of it yeah and you neglect Allah who created this universe so you have to bring people back to the basics what is the basics not either okay knowing Allah if you get this tuned and synchronized in your system in your life wallahi you'll be the happiest man on earth because whatever happens you know that it is happy it had happened due to the three ordainment of Allah the Destiny that Allah had put for you and Muslims believe all the Muslims that when Allah created the pen in the divine pen Allah told it to write yeah so the pen said oh god what should I write Allah told it to write everything that's going to happen until the day of judgment the Prophet said that is a lobster and this was fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation subhanAllah so everything that is happening today and that happened a hundred years ago and will happen a thousand years from now this is all written down to two so whatever happens we feel comfortable that it is from Allah so Jeff go ahead believe in testing questions more than answers and maybe we'll leave it to another episode but nevertheless people we might have people who will say why me what at least okay how me okay okay that's a very question good question mm-hmm now you can ask from here till the break of dawn means about seven or eight hours from now mm-hmm but that won't help you okay because you are not in a position why when when I have my car and I switch it on in early morning and I'd have my engine does my car say hey what why me why not the motorbike why not walk no I own you I do with you whatever I want you and I as servants of Allah Allah created us if Allah wishes he makes us that it's just people on earth yes the healthiest people on earth in a fella wishes he can annihilate all humanity on earth in shorter than a heartbeat yeah so why why is that well this is his creation and he does with his creation whatever he wishes there's none of any of our businesses but it's the one side of the coin that you need to flip it to understand it fully first of all Muslims believe that Allah the Almighty who created us yeah owns us so the ownership belongs to Allah yes he does whatever he wants to we believe Allah is fair and just he would never put any type of transgression or oppression okay upon people whether Muslims or non-muslims okay because he's fair and just three we believe that Allah is wise and knowledgeable so every act is well calculated we may see it the wisdom and we may fail to see that it's like my child six years of age I keep on hugging embracing and kissing him wishing all day long she loves me I love her she feels pain in her stomach I'll take her to the doctor the doctor examines does his test says she has to remove her appendix we have to cut her open and the girl frightened mm-hmm and I tell her it's okay honey it's gonna be all right okay with a very big confident smile they dress her up they take her to the operation operation theater mmm and she sees the doctor with a mask yes and a big knife mm-hmm and is about to cut her stomach open totally she looks at me terrified and I say it's gonna be all right if and Allah has the highest example so no no as a result of her if you believe that a lies merciful is wise is knowledgeable is fair and just and he owns you mm-hmm and you belong to him you let your sales down and say take me wherever you want to take me I'll do what you ask me to do and I accept whatever you do to me so that's total submission this is Islam this is our te-de this is what we call people - hmm so once the people will in this where's the minds was the thinking if they totally submit see the mind plays tricks on us okay the biggest problem is that as I said in the beginning we take things for granted yeah how old are you my friend Richard I'm 48 48 no you're still a young chap so 48 years Allah has been blessing you giving you food giving you the blessing of sight not hearing eating speaking you walk straight your back is okay your knees are well you can jog in the morning sometimes you can eat three meals - five meals a day you have a roof on your head the children are well everything there are so many blessings that Allah has given you yet when someone tells you okay you have 15 minutes between adhan and the armor to make du'a you make dua for a couple of minutes and then okay what is it what is that I made dua for two minutes I think what do I did you make in the nominal law family hey we are neglectful we take everything for granted yeah so if my car is broken one day over the past 20 years I start to whine I start to complain and neglect that Allah has given me so much but only this one moment of time that I'm complaining and objecting but isn't it our nature because in the sin I cannot be here I cannot so it's our nature to forget those days and remember just the negativity how do we deal with just I'll tell you like I would whenever you here in San this usually refers to the disbeliever okay so the knut cannot in arabic means the person who sees the shortcomings and the evil or the bad things and overlooks and neglects the favours and blessings of allah is the watcher yeah so allah when allah tells us in the insanity of bjelica hood it does not condole this or consider it to be a good thing Allah is showing us one of our shortcomings when we decide not to be grateful rather just complain now let us look at the best of humans boom are they the best of humans the prophets the prophets and the messengers look okay look at each one of them mm-hmm did any one of them have a good and easy right well Solomon was a king he was beyond belief even even even shall a man himself was tested yes a few times yes when Allah so gel through his body on the throne and people thought oh thought that he was alive while he was dead he was tested with his father when giving different judgments than others but each one has a calamity mm-hmm well he had to in one interpretation had to slaughter the whole fleet yes yes when they distracted ah yes this is one of the interpretation we're not going to go into this but yes look at prophet Adam Oh being sent out from Jenna because eating from the forbidden tree into position and then being on earth and watching what his sons are doing the killing of her bill to qabil etc yes not all not that let's go to fast forward to no 10 centuries later no for 950 years asking his people to believe and they are in defiance and they refused so the flood comes he mounts on his art art he calls his own flesh and blood his son yes and he refused and dies and drowns as a kafir his own wife dies as a kafir calamity after calamity look at Ibrahim they throw him in the inferno the fire when he was 16 or 17 years of age and allah saves him he goes to Egypt the King Nimrod tries to seduce his wife and then he saves her and he gets her yes as a concubine mm-hmm he gets his first son he's married and Allah tells him as a newborn take him and his mother and leave them in Mecca which is a deserted mountainous area with not a single soul or not a single bird even flying and Allah ordered impute and he does this what calamities are you talking about then when his son is 14 years of age and he's about to become a man mm-hmm Allah revealed to him that you have to slaughter your son mm-hmm does he say listen man this this is too much I'm out yes it doesn't know he says okay I'll do it and Allah sacrifices his son by sending a big ram from the heavens to be sacrificed instead the more you're tested and you steadfast the more Allah makes you stronger and as they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger but you know they'll easily have people sorry but peace will have people will say this were the prophets of Muhammad of allah azzawajal they've spoke with allah they have a special link with allah they strong in their faith but I'm a just a normal Joe you know I'm just a normal man I don't have them all or women for that matter I don't have that faith and I don't have that link I'm just too weak person why to be tested that hard well if you measure the hardship of your test - there's you would find it negligible you'd find it zero and why do you think Allah sent them in the first place why didn't he send them so that they would be your role model yes and I'll give you one one last example so that we can move on from this point yeah prophet Ayub mm-hmm prophet Jacob mm-hmm he was one of the most handsome men hmm one of the richest men his children were so many and they were healthy and beautiful all of a sudden Allah tests him with an illness and he takes away his children his wealth his beauty he becomes handicapped he becomes with special needs his physical appearance makes people resent him and throw him next to a garbage junk yard hmm because he's so offensive to them and how long did this take and he's a Messenger of Allah 18 years look what after 18 years he said Roubini Messenia boo boo and tell him Riley a love that's it I'm not complaining mm-hmm I'm not complaining I'm just saying so just just sayin restores to him everything that was taken away from him imagine Allah restores to him his wife restores his children and sends Lucas made of gold and silver to fall on him from the Kevin's and he keeps on collecting them and putting them in his pockets Lucas made of gold and silver what is this this is a gift from Allah yes because his human is collecting them this is inhuman that is it's a miracle and he's a prophet so Allah says to him are you didn't I make you rich why are you doing this why are you collecting the gold and silver Lucas that's falling upon you mm-hmm he said o Allah I have nothing nothing without your favor and blessing love in Ali and bollocky tick Subhan Allah so he's collecting and acknowledging he's a messenger for eighteen years yes been tested and he remains that fast so now ask yourself your test how long is it now people complaining how long you been in the curfew in the UK couple of weeks yes couple of weeks okay me this is my third Friday that I missed so now we are in our fourth week of curfew handle and Saudi Arabia man people are complaining and whining now remember the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and the entire body Hashem and Benny Abdul Muttalib we're cornered and besieged in a bit for three years not four weeks or three they were besieged they were curfew they were made to be in quarantine for three years no food coming to them for three years nobody selling them a thing for three whole years the Prophet is awesome the best of Allah's creation the best man ever to work the earth and now me and you are complaining why me okey fear Allah Allah has given you so much and yet you are complaining so going with the word with the same theme so Subhan Allah people obviously been enjoying going out shopping Leisure's and trips in holiday but then um you have now this quarantine so we have that just the quarantine for two weeks three weeks so far and people already complaining considering that we've been twenty thirty some of us fifty sixty years because we've never lived experience such a thing at all that we had to be restricted to home and not to go out and subhan allah allah azza we shall have sent many diseases before this as science but nobody have actually listened to them we have the sauce we had the we had the the Ebola and we had a few other things but it was it wasn't actually as much as harsh as in stay home like this one and we're still investing we still go out for shopping and come back but Sao Paulo they forget all that say I'm restricted and I think I'm gonna die because I'm actually I haven't gone out for a long time subhanAllah lisanna cannot be Sharla so how as a Muslim how as a Muslim not to fall into that trap and sha Allah be good believers how to submit and surrender to Allah so we shall see it is one of two honey and ABI talib may Allah be victim says Allah test us with calamities if you are patient and grateful you are rewarded and the calamity remains that it is and you are complaining and not grateful you will be sinful and the calamity remains as it is see what we have texts from the Quran the Silda stating that being patient is praiseworthy when the Prophet says Allah salatu salam it is strange how the affair of the believer is always is too good mm-hmm if he does good then he is grateful and that would be good for him and if he is tested with a calamity he is patient and that is good for him and this is only for a believer the Prophet tells us is a lot - Salam when he visited someone who was suffering from fever yeah he said have the glad tidings from Allah because Allah Almighty says this fever is my fire and I - my believing servant so it would be his substitution for the fire of hell on the day of judgement - vanilla so so Allah is giving us these calamities these illnesses as a form of cleansing of our sins just like you do when a gold because with the gold they use the fire to actually purify it correct correct the steel are in the core iron they heat it until it separates the core from the impurities in it yes but does this mean that we should should say Allah sends the copied 19 and covered 20 and may become a 21 on me so that I would be purified no the Prophet prohibited this Isis Allah Allah if you're gonna ask Allah and ask him for a fee mm-hmm ask for well-being yes but when the calamity strikes then this is when you have to be patient and tolerate so if you look at the believer and the disbeliever the righteous and the sinner you will find that they are all in the same boat okay covered 19 yes yet the believer is different than the disbeliever in the fruit in the end result in the consequence his patient is grateful he is thankful and this is why we believers claim that we are going through this calamity with cool hearts and easy going and we're happy so not happy because we have this calamity okay that we are happy because we realize Allah other blessings and favours upon us subhanAllah so because we submit and to the will of allah azza wajal and we have total submission to him we believe and we believe obviously in his just in his wisdom we not disturbed by this calamity and we shall I take it with a smile and then ask allah azza wajal for this to be purification for us correct correct we've never disturbed in the sense that we complain and we look at other countries who says okay why why not them why us hmm why do we have so many fatalities why so many people are falling sick this is from a large the agenda so you have to be tolerant you have to be patient and you have to make the best of it so you are confined to your home what are you gonna do about it mmm keep on whining complaining or watch all what is this paid on Netflix Hey here we see a true Muslim from a not so true Muslim merchants Muslims when they are tested with calamities they go to Allah granny and forgive us we are expressing our remorse we're repenting we give up all the bad things we don't just have mercy on us now people who are ignorant and of neglect yes as long as I'm 24/7 in my home then I have to see all what's displayed on BBC One BBC four on Netflix on Showtime movies and Apple TV whatever so they are from one cent to the other yeah and the calamity instead of getting them closer to Allah it is getting them further away from Allah soldier tap shake some might ask that I am a good person I'm doing my salavat I'm doing my zakat and boom a sadhaka even I do pay I'm 11 cm on Friday and Thursday and I'm doing all clinics yeah but I'm still why I'm hit hard with it while I see at the same time people for example who's supposed to be not Muslims not good people they are enjoying life they are busy they have bestowed on them all sorts of blessings in this life and then it's how this life being given to these people and I'm not accept that prophets are the most tested ones and if you're in their path will be but why allah azzawajal then give the dunya to these people and not give us Johnny and after dunya and Hereafter why not okay one of the easiest angle would be that Allah gives the dunya gives wealth health and prosperity to those whom he loves and to those whom he does not love so if I go to Sweden I've never been there and I hear it's a beautiful place they're beautiful people they're tall they're beautiful they're blue eyes green areas lakes natural things they've got money they've got wealth one of the best social system they have but they're not believers they have suicide through they have three types of sex their anxiety they have stress so Allah gives this to believers a disbelievers but believe you me mm-hmm Allah does not give a man does not give content does not give belief except to the believers whom he loves so he gives the dunya to whom he loves and to whom he doesn't but akhirah they believe the content he only gives to those whom he loves so now the question of a 1 1 million pounds pound is rate is down now the Quran in everything so when the one million Kuwaiti dinar question would be how and why is it that hard on me hmm I'll tell you okay I'll give you five scenarios you pick and choose okay would you'd like a foreign team for a couple of months not being able to go out not be able to work than be able to do anything more I'll test you with one with being with their oh hinge er for being tortured killed the women raped that the children slaughtered by the Buddhists would you like to be with their hinge and me an amount no I'll pass okay would you like to be with the Syrians in Syria in Eid Lib where battles of explosives fall upon them and they see their father their sister their son being burnt alive and they can't put the puff fire off they hear their screams feeling that their ears said I'll pass would you like to be among the refugees in boats going in the midde Turanian from Italy to Greece to wherever everybody's kicking them down and and maybe shooting at them there just to fear them until they drown and they can't do anything would you like to be in a famine struck country with drought where you have to walk 20 kilometres for half a glass of water for your child whom you are carrying his skin over bones and you watch him wither away and die in your arms mmm failing to give him this half a glass of water would you like to have a colon cancer della protectors or no bolsa a breast cancer for four women so then now I hear you wanna complain and again mm-hmm and lastly and I'll end up with this now you're complaining of having a test so hard subhan allahi al alene this test that you are suffering from how would you like to be tested with a Bugatti Sharon or with a mansion in tundra overlooking the Mediterranean in the Atlantic Ocean or would you like to be tested with a g4 jet taking you from one place to the other when you have a beautiful kind and loving mother whom um whatever you say to her she gives you a smile next door and prepares food and gives you money is it difficult to be kind to your mother shouldn't be any Tom Dick or Harry would be kissing her feet day and night there's no testing it the test is when your mother is abusive when your mother is shouting and cursing you all the time when your mother is always complaining that you're not being dutiful when you are trying your level best here is the test nurture of being kind and here is your test that Allah is giving you and let's see whether you pass your faith Subhan Allah some of the people come to this life and they're trying to test Allah so we shall forgetting that Allah so Allah is the one who's testing him in this life so they do things and they they change things and they do the praise and the supplications and dad says well Allah doesn't give me as if like this life is tested to Allah so she'll not the other way around so Paula shave you gave us food for thought and you've raised more questions but insha'Allah we'll have you next week and we'll have both questions and answers inshallah we have a sister Dana she asking something is not on this topic but she's asking a question she asked three times and she said how many ellicott there is in salat of the whole please okay I'm trying to double-check is it that she means Sunnah yes because yes she said she meant is you want to explain the Sunnah of those  how many records are because she asked three times sorry yeah okay I get hundreds of questions a day and from my experience the people in the subcontinent India Pakistan Bangladesh and sometimes Sri Lanka they have this concept which we they were taught by their imams and scholars that each prayer has a number of Records and they believe that it is mandatory so they come to you and say ok it is 13 so sure I said what do you what do you mean 13 together is the 13 raka Amanda takes know Asia in Islam is only for now if you want to add a little bit more you pray 2 rakat soon if you want to add a little bit more you pray night prayer hmm which is the sky's the limit and then you end and conclude with witcher by raesha is 4 so coming back to Dina's question yes though her is for the horse for so this is what this is what makes you a Muslim mashallah from I don't Muslim yes but if you want to ask about the voluntary then I would say there is what is known as emphatic Sundin Shonen al qaeda or atiba and these are 12 today and not of the 5 prayers hmm if you maintain training these 12 records during the day and the night Allah will build you a palace in paradise but you have to observe them so to before fetcher yes so the fault I'm not talking about I'm talking about the to soon them then we come to learn the four fault we don't have any dispute on that the in fact extender of law are four raka before and to recur after these four raucous the majority of scholars except for an amiable hanifa say that you have to pray them two by two okay so you pray 2 rakaats of Rousillon then send up pray another 2 rakaat an officer so an answer does not have any in fact extendin Maghrib and Isha both have 2 rakaats afterwards so these are 12 Rech eyes okay one last question what about the dog how many the heart of the two ha okay we have a big umbrella mm-hmm called night prayer okay night prayer underneath this umbrella comes taraweeh comes to hide Jude comes PMLA comes with it okay likewise in the morning time hmm we have bla prayer underneath it comes solitude is rock okay which is a special prayer in a special format with a special set of rewards mm-hmm then the time is open for Baja in general so what is the time for doha the time for doha is to be prayed ten minutes after full sunrise yeah and it is extended until five to ten minutes before the event of war yes so all of this is considered to be time for Doha prayer how many Erica minimum is two and the sky is the limit okay when you say full sunrise is that ten minutes after the sunrise time but that we have in our calendar yes yes because when this is a big problem yeah so you see this is the edge of my my screen see this is the horizon yes it is nighttime the minute you see the edge of the Sun but your time is over yes the minute the Sun rises and count from this time until ten minutes this is the time for beginning of prayer mm-hmm mashallah Tabarrok Allah do we have time for another question my wife doesn't want me home so I've been seeing her for the past four weeks every single night 24/7 I said go we got for Hasan Ali say salaam-o-alaikum can can a person give more than 2.5 percent is a cat like five percent for example instead in order to make sure the person doesn't go below the 2.5 percent as the person may have lots of coins and they don't want to count all of what is mandatory is the 2.5 okay now if you want to give more that would not be part of the cat that would be charity so if you want to be safe and give 2.5 percent extra or 5% extra more 10% extra just to be safe whether something was missed here or there this is totally legit but it won't be part of the cat it would be of general charity and rest assure Allah will not miss a single penny that you pay for his sake inshallah so in case he missed it that will go out of his occur of out of a sadhaka and the rest will be Southwark inshaallah correction just like a lavish a thank you very much we were personally I was very happy to meet my teacher for the first time here so she's like Allah here I really enjoyed that tuition and here and I was waiting every week for your tuitions on a Serie mashallah tabarak Allah these brothers and sisters that's all what we have today and insha'Allah we'll be back next week with more talk last talk last words the chef for this week my last words is stay safe and do your level best to utilize the time this is a gift from Allah don't look at the empty half of the glass look at the full half of the glass so don't look at this as a crisis but look at it as a blessing and favor from Allah spend quality time with the children and try to utilize half an hour only for an hour to spend with your children teaching them something about Islam talking to them listening to them okay we talk and preach a lot and no one preaches as much as I do but I rarely listen to people talk so listen to your children listen to what they have to say to you share with them their feelings now it is the time for you as men to be kind to your wives now it's the for you to try and enter the kitchen give a helping hand help with the dishes it's not a time of relaxation because the load on our wives has doubled or tripled because we are staying home so give a helping hand to increase your own knowledge don't waste your time watching movies or Netflix or listening to music watch scholars learn from lectures study textbooks memorize for add so insha'Allah you would become better and stronger inshallah the psychology for the wise words and shala will take your advice forward insha'Allah and hopefully we will leave the quarantine period better than we actually started it G button sister is nila is that come on love here and just like a la Hache for your time and shadow we're looking forward to meet you next week until then keep well stay safe and tuning assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh for Salama"
