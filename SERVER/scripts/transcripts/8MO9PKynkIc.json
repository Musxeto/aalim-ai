  "transcript": "his third question says that he has I think Down syndrome or something like that and he's 13 years of age how can he help Islam well our he you sound to me like a very normal person so first of all don't believe in whatever people tell you and convince you of believe in Allah solution and after that believe in the powers that Allah has put in yourself think always positive of Allah Sojin and think always positive of yourself while depending relying and trusting Allah Almighty make a lot of duaa in your suit to make you better stronger and more influential more I think this is the right adjective to be more effective in calling people to Islam because masha'Allah you have the brains for it and you have the words for it so you can serve Islam even if you're unable to walk there's social media there are so many lectures youtubes that can benefit the whole world if you know how to select and to communicate with other others and I don't see any problem in your communication skills so may allah azza wajal use you in giving Dawa and to spread his word"
