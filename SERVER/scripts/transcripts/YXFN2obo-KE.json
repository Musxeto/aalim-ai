  "title": "Is it permissible to marry someone from Jehovah witness ? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Our first question is from the email. Aisha says, Is it permissible for a Muslim man to marry a girl which is a Jehovah Witness? A Muslim man is allowed to marry a Muslim woman, a Christian woman, or a Jewish woman. He cannot marry any of other denominations or other religions. So this was mentioned in the Qur'an in Chapter 5. It was explained in the Sunnah of the Prophet ï·º. And the consensus of scholars is upon this. However, to answer your question, we have to first recognize, are the Jehovah or Jehovah Witnesses considered to be Christians or not? And this depends on the Christians themselves. If they say that, if you ask the Catholics, the Orthodox Christians, or the Protestants, and you ask them, are they Christians? In principle, yes they are. And they might be more Christian than the Christians themselves, in the sense that they go to the literal meaning of the Bible, and they do not advocate Trinity. They do not believe in Trinity. They believe though that Jesus, peace be upon him, is the Son of God. May Allah be exalted. But in principle, yes they are considered to be Christians, with few minor things such as their disbelief in the hereafter, in the sense that paradise is what you live in. And they don't believe in the existence of hell, and the torment of the grave, or of the hell, etc. But other than that, it seems to me that they are Christians, and hence it is permissible for a Muslim to marry from them. However, why would a Muslim choose a woman from another religion, as long as you have all what you need in your own religion? A lot of the marriages that are interfaith have problems, and this is due to the fact that they might have chemistry for a year or two, or even more. But then disputes and troubles may come in their lives, and only ending up with a divorce, a separation, and the woman taking the children with her. And we, or I, have seen a lot of cases where children who were born to a Muslim father, ended up being Christian and baptized. And this is totally unacceptable. So you as a Muslim man, you should choose for your children the very best, and you should choose a Muslim woman to marry."
