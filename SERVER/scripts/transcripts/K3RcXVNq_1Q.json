  "transcript": "from germany i have a question i live in germany and am i a student and in germany there are all all services which requires monthly payment have paid payment fee or interest for example i have wi-fi in at my home and we pay 30 euros and with late payment fee there is halal alternative which which is prepaid but i must pay 110 euros also i have i have a student loan without interest half of it is a gramps over me but after five years i must pay it back with uh with if i don't pay paid back there is late payment fee so my question is uh if if i don't necessarily need them but they make my life much easier and save me a lot of money can i do these contracts or these things first of all the contracts that are mandatory for you to engage in without any alternative you live in a kafir country you're obliged and forced to opt for a house you have to live so you go and rent in every single apartment or flat or duplex they have this condition that you must pay late payment fee if you're late for a week or two and there is no other alternative in this case is so much tight and narrow islam makes it wider and gives you the concession because there is no other alternative but if there is another alternative then you have to opt for that alternative and avoid this condition because this condition is actually an agreement for riba though you're not going to pay it but you don't know the circumstances you don't know whether you'll fall ill or be imprisoned or for any given reason and then the riba is occurring on your financials in this case you are the one who's sinful for signing and agreeing for it but if there is an alternative you have to opt for that and allah knows best as for their student loans it's not permissible with this condition you must not opt for student loans that asks you to pay after five years and if you fail there is reba on it this is totally prohibited you"
