  "transcript": "Abdul Wahhab from Hong Kong. Abdul Wahhab. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So my question is I work in an airport as a baggage handler. Sometimes a haram package such as musical instruments pass by once in a day or two. So I have to put it in a belt when I'm working alone. So what's the ruling on it? No problem Inshallah. You can put it on the belt. Maybe it's filled with dead cats. You never know. So just assume the best and put it and it's once every blue moon and it's not your business to investigate what's in it Inshallah. you"
