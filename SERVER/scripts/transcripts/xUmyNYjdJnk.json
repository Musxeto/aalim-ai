  "transcript": "Dr zaka last question today last but not least what does Islam say about the respect given to parents as you mentioned that disrespect to parents is number e in the 70 major sins in Islam according to imabi and it's very sinful to respect parents therefore there are various vers in the Quran and the Hadith which show emphasis on respecting the parents Allah says in the Quran in Surah is chapter number 17 verse number 23 and 24 Allah says that we have ordained that you worship none but Allah subhana wa tala that you be kind to your parents and if one of them or both of them Reach old age don't say a word of contempt to them don't say o to them but address them with honor and lower to them your wing of humility and pray to the Lord that bless them as they cherish me in childhood that means if your parents reach old age one of them or both of them you can't even say o to them further mention in the Quran in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse number 151 that Allah says Be Good to your parents and he says in several vers in the Quran especially your mother Allah says in N 4 vers number one respect the womb that bore you Allah says in Sur lukman chapter number 31 verse number 14 we have enjoyed on the the human beings to be good to the parents in traval upon traval did the mother B them and in years Twain was the Ving Allah says in Surah chapter number 46 verse number 15 we have enjoyed on the human beings to be kind to the parents in pain did the mother bore you and in pain did she give you birth so here Allah says respect your parents especially the mother and there are various Hadith talking about respecting the mother it's mentioned s bukari volume number eight in the book of AD book of manners chapter number two Hadith number 5971 a person comes to the prophet M wasallam and asks him that who deserves the best companionship in this world the prophet says your mother the man asked after that two the prophet repeats your mother the man asked after that two again the prophet says for the third time your mother the man asked after that who then the prophet says your father that means 75% 34 of the companionship goes to the mother 25% 1/4 goes to the father in short the mother gets the gold medal she gets the silver medal and she gets the bronze medal the father has to be satisfied with the m consolation price so these are the teachings in Islam as far respect to parents are concerned and a mother gets three times more companionship thce more companionship than the father it further mentioned in the Hadith of s bukari volume number four Hadith number 34 a man came to the prophet and sought his permission to go to Jihad that is fighting the way of Allah subhana in the battlefield the prophet asked him that do you have parents he said yes so he said that you go and serve your parents showing the importance that serving parents and being beautiful towards one parents is more important than going for Jihad fighting the way of Allah subhana tala if your parents require you it's more important serve your parents than to go for Jihad fighting the way of Allah subhana tala same message is given in s bukari Vol number eight in the book of adab Hadith number 5970 that a person asked that which deed is dearest to Allah subhana wa taala and the prophet said that offering the five prescribed prayers at the earliest time the man asked after that which is the de the prophet said being dutiful towards your parents the man asked after that which the prophet said that fighting the way of Allah subhana doing Jihad so here we realize that after offering prayers at the prescribed time at the earliest time the next thing Allah likes is being dutiful towards your parents respecting your parents being obedient to your parents and then comes J the of Allah subhana tala it's mention mus Ahmed Hadith number 5372 the prophet said the three types of people will be deprived from going to Paradise the first is one who drinks intoxicants number two one who disobedient to the parents and number three one who does shameful Deeds on behalf of the family so all these three people deprive Paradise so therefore disrespecting the parents is one of the major sins in Islam"
