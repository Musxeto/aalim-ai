  "transcript": "Abdullah from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh why do people hate Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab even though he did a really good work, he wrote Kitab At-Tawheed, he wrote such good books, why do people still hate him? Do people hate Muhammad Ibn Abdullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam? Abdullah No Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab I'm asking you, do people nowadays hate our Prophet, our Muslim Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam? Do people hate him? Not the Prophet, not the Prophet Ya Akhi, I understand, how do you perceive me as a child sucking his thumb? I understood your question about Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab, I'm asking you to compare apple to apple though there is no comparison at all between Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam and Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab, I'm asking you, our Prophet Muhammad, is he hated by the Jews, the Christians, the Buddhists and the likes, yes or no? Yes Okay, why? Because they don't follow Now when you look at those who hate Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab, who are they? You will not find a single Muslim following the Quran and the Sunnah hating him, never! Those who hate Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab are either burnt Shia, Rafida, or burnt Sufi, grave worshippers or innovators like a lot of them in the subcontinent who buy their way to people's hearts through their false religion, so they gather people's money by brainwashing the people of a new religion that has no relationship to Islam, Quran or Sunnah, and this way Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab poses a huge threat to their reign and to their money collection from the masses that they control, when they say kill so and so, the mobs go and kill, demonstrate they come in the thousands and the millions, they want this power, so how can they remain on their thrones by hating Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab? Who is Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab? I don't know, I've never met him, he is a great leader, a great Imam who came at a time when Arabia and the whole of Middle East was indulged in a swamp of shirk and innovation, he simply came and cleansed our religion from what's not related to it, and he fought against all shirk, all grave worshipping, all signs of kufr and innovation, simple as that, where is he? Oh he's dead 300 years ago, is he a saint? No, do we have a shrine on his grave? No, do we use his name to cure our illnesses and to get jinn out of people's bodies? No, he's just a scholar and he's a follower of Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim and the great scholars of Islam, so people who hate him simply hate him because they hate Islam, simple as that."
