  "transcript": "that says why does allah care about parents emotions more than children emotions what's the children's fault first of all karen or afrina sorry nobody has the right to question allah azzawajal this is totally inappropriate and disrespectful especially when being word worded in such a fashion to indicate an objection or this is not fair so this is definitely inappropriate and not allowed however if we look at your question you're saying why does allah care about the parents emotions and he instructs the children to be dutiful obedient and respectful while not asking the the parents to be as cordial as that the reason is and allah knows best that the inner feeling of compassion mercy love and kindness is natural in the hearts of the parents so you don't preach the choir as they say you don't need to while the children are by nature rebellious disobedient and at times ungrateful so allah made it clear that they must go out of their way to be kind dutiful obedient respectful and taking care of their parents this is the general tendency this is the norm you will find sometimes that some of the parents are not at all compassionate or caring or loving yet this abnormality does not justify the children to be disobedient or disrespectful the parents who are of such a nature would be held accountable on the day of judgment and allah azzawajal would surely punish them for their behavior yet even if they were the worst of people they still have an upper upper hand for being the reason of a person existing in this world and the least you could do to repay them is to follow allah's commands which is a form of worship which is a form of showing your subservience to allah azzawajal when you obey and respect and become dutiful and kind to this parent who doesn't deserve it in our worldly standards but simply because allah told us to be as this we are in compliance with it"
