  "transcript": "mahdi from bangladesh uh sheikh um sometimes i watch youtube videos about cars and food which contain background music now i know that they're haram and inshallah i will leave them shaykh so sheikh my question is that can i do thicker while watching these videos okay i would answer it from bangladesh she says sometimes i watch music well not music beneficial videos about cars about mobile phones and there is background music so if i make thicker would i be sinful this depends if making vikkar while knowing that there is a sin going on and you are caring less about the sin of allah so you're listening to the sin and making thicker it is this is disrespectful to allah but if you're forced like if i go to a mall and the music is blowing everywhere and i have to go to the mall so what do i do i either listen to the quran or i make dhikr so that i would take my mind off what is being played so this is okay this is halal there is no problem in that but as long as you know it's sinful then you should not do this this is something that you must avoid and stay away from"
