  "transcript": "Tea from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam. Uh yeah yeah Sheikh um Sheikh I um read on your website about circumcision and I wanted to ask you um you mentioned on the Ibn Abbas is of the view that there's no hajj or prayer for the one that's not circumcised so if someone was lazy and never got circumcised and they're a revert um and say like now they got debts what takes priority and will they not would their prayer not be valid going forwards are you of that this is not the authentic opinion the authentic opinion is a person who's circumcised or a person let me rephrase that a person who is not circumcised he's a Muslim now whether there is urine left over or not this may hamper his prayer but if he cleanses himself correctly his prayer his hajj all of these are valid without any problem but he should prioritize it before paying off his debts"
