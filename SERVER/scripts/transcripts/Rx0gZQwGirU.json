  "transcript": "[Questioner] From the Emirates so um I need advice \nabout the way to go about my cultural way of   dealing with things so we we're Muslims right but \nmajority of the way we conduct our business is   not in accordance with Islamic values and what \ndo I mean you know uh the cousins the cousins   are considered like brothers so we mix feelings \nthey're like just like our own blood brothers so   when you try to when you know more about Islam \nand you you try to kind of like set boundaries   with so many things it's just it's so hard with \nour cultures and by the time you know you find   yourself trying to find those things you feel so \nisolated and you feel like you you it's just so   weird what advice would you give someone like \nme and it's not just me so many other people   that I know are going through the same thing \nwell um Muhammad I forgot the name um Amina   the issue is what is the use if all your relatives \nsurrounded you loved you cared for you and   respected you while Allah azzawajal is angry with \nyou you've lost everything whoever finds Allah   he has everything and then whoever loses Allah \nhe has lost everything if everyone boycotts me   does not speak to me isolates me but I'm doing \nthis for the sake of Allah and Allah he's with me   I'm the happiest man on Earth the Allah \ndescribed Ibrahim to be an ummah of his own the Prophet (Peace and Blessings Upon Him) when \nhe came with Islam and he called the people to   Islam they boycotted him and his companions \nfor three years in ... in a in a remote area   of Mecca three years not allowing food or drink \nto come to them not allowing people to marry from   them not allowing anyone to communicate with \nthem did this make any difference not at all   so you have to understand that as long as you \nare with Allah azzawajal and what you're doing   is for the sake of Allah and you try to explain \nto the people that what do you want me to do   this is the religion of Allah Allah the almighty \ntold me that your female cousins are Non-mahram   so you have to treat them as such my female \ncousin is like any woman walking on the street   any random woman she's a stranger total stranger \nwhat rights do I have to go to this woman on the   streets and say good evening how are you how are \nthe kids how's the husband let's have lunch some   day she's a total stranger and my cousin is even \nworse because of the relationship between us so   remains steadfast always remember that this \nis the same route that the prophet Islam and   the companions had walked through and if you are \nfollowing their footsteps you will be inshallah   with them on the day of judgment all what you \ncan do is give dawah explain the religion show   the people that this is not my way this is the \nway of Allah this is Sharia bring me proof from   the Quran that this is permissible then I'll \ndo it people always complain your beard is   too long it's too thick give me reason to shave \nit give me an Evidence I'll shave it today live   on air what lie do you think I love having a \nbeard this is what Allah mandated I love it   but if I have a way out of it that Islamic \nand pleases Allah I'll do it on the spot   so whatever we do we do it for the sake \nof Allah and whatever the people are doing   they're doing it for the sake of Satan knowingly \nor unknowingly so don't care about what people   do to you as they say what doesn't kill you \nmakes you stronger so be steadfast on Islam   as uh for the sake of Allah and you'll end up \nwith good results with the grace of Allah me and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford \nit that's good for you if you cannot you're   entitled for one free session and this is for \neverybody if they can affirm by Allah that they   cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give \nthem one free session without a problem a full   half an hour so come to me and let's speak \nabout it inshallah within the following two   days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
