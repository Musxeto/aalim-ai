  "transcript": "Manahil from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is that sometimes I get really bad thoughts or doubts or sometimes I start thinking negatively of Allah and not just waswasa like actual doubts and I know this is kufr and like this goes on for like almost an hour or 30 minutes and I start to cry and I have a panic attack but then later on like I comfort myself like for example I would be questioning why did Allah do this and then I will be like Manahil how dare you whatever Allah does is out of his wisdom out of his knowledge and because he knows best and out of his just and fairness and Sheikh then I'll go and I'll repent to Allah, repeat my shahada, I'll ask for forgiveness and then I'll be okay but then again I'll fall into these doubts and it'll go on for an hour and then I'll get myself out of this and then repent to Allah and this goes on like I keep having these really bad doubts so Sheikh my question is does this make me a hypocrite? Okay first of all this is a classical case of satanic whispers and this is what Satan is designed to do the Prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam Allah has forgiven my ummah for my sake for whatever intrusive thoughts that cross their minds unless they speak about it or act upon it intrusive thoughts come and go every individual has them we all have them some people only manage to have them for a second or two and they disappear with their strength of iman and dependence and reliance in Allah other people it may resonate for a while but eventually it goes away now what you fight and it goes away you're not sinful for that unless you speak to anyone about them or act upon them what you're sinful for are the thoughts that are initiated from your lack of iman or from the lack of existence of belief in Allah so yes I'm doubtful I don't know if Allah exists or not yes I have doubts in this and that why would Allah do this what if these are initiated because you believe in it then yes you are a hypocrite you're a hundred percent hypocrite and you're in great danger because it's only a matter of time before you leave the fold of Islam and this is serious I'm not saying this to or I'm not supposed to comfort you by saying no no no it's okay just ignore it no this is serious you have to have faith and strong iman in Allah azza wa jal and what's driving you to this is your lack of iman because you have weak iman and usually in counseling sessions we get to speak about this and see the root cause of it and why this is happening and whether it is the environment or your contact list or what you're studying is impacting you negatively or not so my advice to you is to strengthen your iman go to my youtube channel and watch my playlist on the beautiful names of Allah watch the three principal fundamentals and the Islamic faith these three playlists would cement your aqeedah inshallah and strengthen your iman"
