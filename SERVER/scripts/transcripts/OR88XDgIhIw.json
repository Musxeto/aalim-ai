  "title": "How did we get the 4 schools of thought & why did the four imams differ in opinion? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "zaid zubair says i'm asking about the four imams why did they differ in their ruling this is his first question the four imams are one of the four greatest scholars of islam they were not the greatest scholars of islam they were scholars who were far far more knowledgeable than them such as abdullah mubarak and so on however these great scholars did not find students to spread their views and make schools for them so their opinions soon weathered away while the four imams the four schools of thought imam abu hanif and imam malik imam muhammadin and imam ahmed muhammad allah have mercy on their souls they had lots and lots of students who carried their legacy and spread their views all over the world that's why they have a great following why did they differ islam in tamiya has compiled a beautiful small booklet where he explains this and it's called faslul and he mentioned in this beautiful book rafal malam that one of the main reasons of difference of opinion is that the evidence did not reach the imam for example imam abu hanifa may allah have mercy on his soul did not travel as much as imam ahmed for example so a lot of the hadiths that were available in egypt in damascus in mecca medina and in yemen were not available at al-kufa at that time in in iraq so he only gave verdicts in accordance to what he had known of not of the entire sharia because he wasn't capable of obtaining that evidence because they did not have print houses and books that we have a um the ability to research and look into one of the reasons that they differed is that the evidence may have reached them but they did not classify it as authentic so they may believe that this hadith was weak and we know that imam malik imam ashafi and imam ahmad were all scholars of hadith and they had the ability to authenticate and to weaken a hadith according to the chain of narrators according to the texts according to so many things so yes they've got hold of the evidence but they did not think it was authentic a third reason was that they did get hold of the evidence and it was indeed authentic but they believed that it meant something else as per the quran and this is mentioned in chapter 2 surat al-baqarah a woman who's divorced should observe her edda for three and scholars differed whether this is referring to purity or to menses and the reason is that in arabic it can be both likewise he differed with all other schools of thought when it came to the verse which speaks about wudu and tayammum so the ayah says or nisa can be interpreted as you touched women and it can be interpreted as you had sexual intercourse with women so the majority of scholars say that touching a woman does not break your wudu while imam sheikh says it does so the evidence is there and it's authentic but the understanding is different and it could have been to some of them authentic and understanding is true but it was abrogated and the other side thinks that no it is not abrogated it is still valid so there are so many reasons for their difference of opinion and this is why allah mentioned it in the quran that whenever you dispute or differ in regards to an issue then you have to return it and consult allah and the prophet isaiah meaning the quran and the sunnah of the prophet"
