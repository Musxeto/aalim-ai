  "transcript": "third question if I come early like a week early or ten days do I have to stay in the state of a Honda answer is yes see if you come let's assume two weeks before the day of hatch the option is that you perform your rom you wear put on your run the logical thing would be that you go to Mecca do your toe off do your sign for Roma which means that you become Matamata and after you finish say you clip your hair you wear your normal clothes you're as good as new go back to jitters day and Mecca whatever you want you're just a normal person not in the state of a harem on the eighth you put on your harem and you go straight to Mina now if you're doing a frat or peer on once you put your rom you cannot exit it until the day of eight and if you come two weeks early this is too difficult to stay in the clothes of a harem for two weeks so why insist on the fraud when you have the option of tomato this is what the Prophet erase awesome recommended it's his companions to do and he told them maker ambra I said how can we make Oh Maria rasoolallah and then cut our hair and have intimacy with our wives and then go to Hajj he said this is religion this is the best type of hatch which is tomato but if you don't want to then you have to stay in your alarm"
