  "transcript": "if some enters the masjid and the salah is already started do i join the jamaa or do i offer the two rakata masjid it is totally prohibited it is totally prohibited to offer any type of salat once the congregation has been called so if the ikarma was established and the imam says allahu akbar and he begins his salaat if i come to the masjid i cannot pray the haiti i cannot pray sunnah till fajr i cannot pray any voluntary prayer and if i do this is invalid it's void allah does not accept it because the prophet salallahu whenever the prayer is called for the comma then there is no prayer valid other than the maktuba other than the fault so you cannot do that and if you do your prayer is invalid"
