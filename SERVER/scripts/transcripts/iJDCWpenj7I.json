  "transcript": "Next question, how do I improve my level of smoking habit? Again and again and again. Smoking is what? Masha Allah, we have Muftis here. No. Okay, it's my mistake. I'm asking a generic question. What do you expect, Einstein? Okay, I apologize. Don't be aggressive. Why are you so fighting and you want to jump into my neck? Smoking is a symptom. Not covering is a symptom. Listening to music is a symptom. Not praying on time is a symptom. You want to tackle these symptoms, tackle the main cause of the illness. So why is your husband smoking? Because his iman has deficiency in it, has weakness. Why is your wife not covering? Because her iman is little. Why your son is not praying in the masjid? Because his iman is weak. Strengthen the iman. So if you try to nag your husband about smoking, he may refrain, but he may not stop. He may do it behind your back. He may do it in the car. He may pick up other bad habits and you keep on nagging and nagging and nagging. No, build up iman. Build up the fear of Allah in his heart. Build up to do what Allah wants. See, our problem in our marriages, alongside our other relationships, they're not based on Islam. If my marriage was based on Islam, on iman, if I have a conflict with my wife, the moment I say, قَالَ اللَّهَ قَالَ الرَّسُولَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامِ and the scholars say this, done. Qalas, over. I'm not going to fight over something that has been already answered by Allah Azza wa Jal. But when we don't adhere to the Quran, to the sunnah, or to what the scholars say, we have problems. So go back to the basics. See where the deficiency is with your husband. Try to build it up. Try to encourage him. Try to say positive things so that he could feel your love and your compassion and your encouragement instead of just keeping on criticizing everything he does. And inshallah, it will take some time, but it will inevitably work bi'ithnillah."
