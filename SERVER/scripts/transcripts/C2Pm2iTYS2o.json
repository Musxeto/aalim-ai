  "title": "Reality of Tawheed al Haakimiyyah: Establishing an Islamic Government!",
  "transcript": "some other sects focus only on the islamic government so their whole primary objective is not to hate it's hakamiya it is to legislate only through the sharia which is a valid cause definitely and it's part of islam it's part of tahit but it is not tauhid alone and some of them due to this objective went again to the same issue of uniting so in order to join the parliament we have to cut some loose ends we have to compromise a little the beard is too long it's not representable we have to trim it the hijab is covering a lot we have to compromise maybe show some hair maybe show the whole hair i'm covering my bosoms and that's the most important thing and you find that people are diluting their religion to become another religion all what they care about is to have the government to have the power and we've seen what the pursue of such a government led many countries to end up in chaos poverty lack of security and for what to have an islamic government yes this is a legitimate reason but you can't have it without cementing without setting the foundation through tawheed thirteen years alas assam spent in makkah he never ever asked them to form a government or to ask for power nor even to fight defending themselves because they were a minority they were weak and now we see what's happening on the arena when you abandon to hate"
