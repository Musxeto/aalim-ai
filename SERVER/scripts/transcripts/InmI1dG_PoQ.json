  "transcript": "maryam says is ovarian rejuvenation and freezing of eggs permissible in islam now this question to me is a little bit um tricky i don't want to know what ovarian rejuvenation is and most likely it is something to to be taken layers to be taken maybe from the uterus which are filled with eggs so that a woman can use that after 5 10 15 years when she is older to insert this again and recreate new eggs that are healthier maybe i don't know maybe but the issue of eggs freezing the eggs this is a frequently asked questions and people usually ask this question because in the west it is widely practiced so a woman for example having marital issues with her husband her husband is getting old maybe he's about to die and she's young she's thinking of conceiving she doesn't know what to do they opt for ivf but ivf is for now she's thinking about five ten years down the line even ivf is an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars say that it's not permissible at all others say it's permissible without any limitations some put limitations and conditions to it now we have a ruling in islam one of the maxim uh legal maxims in islam major ruling which is necessities would make things that are prohibited permissible so a person stranded in the desert doesn't have any food he's about to die literally die out of starvation and he finds a dead donkey so what's the ruling should he die or eat from it no necessity to prevent him from dying allows him to eat from that yet this ruling is governed by another ruling which states something like this that necessities are measured by its actual weight not every necessity is a necessity that permits haram and there is a certain weight to such a necessity for example the brother who we just talked about who's using the first legal maxim saying that yeah i'm hungry and i'm gonna stop i'm gonna die literally so it's permissible for me to eat from this donkey so he makes a feast and he starts to make steak and marinates it with certain sauces and does this and that and what are you doing should i have a necessity and i'm making the best of it no the necessity is measured by its actual weight the actual weight is that you eat a morsel or two that would prevent you from dying and stop not to make the best of it and enjoy it likewise it's a necessity to have car insurance otherwise the government will sue you or penalize you or fine you so you opt for the minimum accepted level not go for premium coverage with uh lots of benefits that are uncalled for so this is for ivf now freezing the eggs would require that your aura is exposed that there is a possibility of such doctors who do not fear allah azzawajal and they know that this man is impotent or that the eggs are not worthy of reproduction so they may lie and cheat just to make money and bring someone's else's eggs or a sea men and mix them them up the possibilities are there so is this equivalent to the amount of necessity we have at hand freezing the eggs definitely does not and it's not permissible because there is nothing of a necessity especially those who come and say my husband died couple of years ago and i would like to have a child this is not permissible he was my husband yes but he's not your husband anymore and it can't if we can go on and on speaking on this but the in a nutshell it's not permissible you"
