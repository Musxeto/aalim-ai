  "transcript": "Abu Uzay from Holland. He says that some of \nthe Christians say that the verse وَاللَّـهُ   خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ [Ali 'Imran 3:54] that \nal-makar is an attribute of deception. And how   can Allah deceive others? First of all, Abu Uzay, \ndo we take our religion from the Christians?   This is nonsense. Look at the people who talk \nabout our religion when they can't even explain   how is their god three in one. This is heads \nand shoulders - three in one. So you don't take   anything from them. They all, what they have, is \nto cast doubts. And to us it would be fruitless,   it would be illogical to start defending what \nthey're throwing at us. And every time say 'Okay,   why do men marry four, women don't marry except \none?' 'Ah because this and that-' 'Okay why does a   daughter inherits half and the son inherits full?' \n'Uh because of this-' 'Why do men not wear gold   where women can wear gold? What-' And you spend \nyour time refuting their allegations which is   not fruitful. They don't believe in the system to \nbegin with so why would I waste my time with them?   First of all, Allah tells us in the Qur'an,\nقُلۡ يٰۤـاَهۡلَ الۡكِتٰبِ تَعَالَوۡا اِلٰى   كَلِمَةٍ سَوَآءٍۢ بَيۡنَـنَا وَبَيۡنَكُمۡ \n[Ali 'Imran 3:64] 'O, People of the Book!   Come to common terms. First of all, you want to \ndiscuss things about Islam? I have no problem.   Let's establish first of all this universal \nfact that, there is no other God worthy of   being worshipped except Allah and not to associate \nothers with Him. How is that? 'Oh, no no we will   talk about this later let's talk a-' No, no, \nno. This is what we're talking about. If they're   willing, Alhamdulillah we will prove that there's \nnot three in one. It's only one. La ilaha illahu.   If they don't, I don't need to talk to them.   They don't have the authority or even they.. they \nhave the audacity to come and speak to us about   the characteristics of Allah and the attributes \nof Allah Azza wa Jal? This is ridiculous. So,   does Allah deceive? No. Allah does not deceive. \nAllah. Azza wa Jal, meets the things that   those disbelievers do in the same fashion, \nbecause this is what fairness and justice is.   Allah does not deceive people, but when you \ndeceive Allah, when you cheat Allah Azza wa Jal,   Allah will deal with you and treat you in the \nsame fashion you treated Him. Then this is what   they call touche. There's no form of aggression \nor oppression in it. You dealt with Allah like   in this fashion, Allah deals with you in the same \nfashion. You're kind and generous and obedient to   Allah, Allah would deal with you in the same \nfashion. And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
