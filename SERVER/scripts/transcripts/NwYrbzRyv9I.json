  "title": "Is It Permissible To Pray In A Barelvi Mosque when they say the Prophet ﷺ was created from the light",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Qatar So in my home country of Pakistan there are many   Berelvi Masjids in my area in which the \nMuadhin before giving the Adhan says [ ] So if I don't know if the imam \nthere believes that Rasoolullah ﷺ   is the literal light of Allah then would it \nbe permissible to pray behind him without   asking him about his Aqeedah as it's possible \nthat he believes that Rasoolullah ﷺ is the   [ ] light of Allah or must I ask him what \nhe believes before praying behind them? Generally speaking Berelvis are not \nfollowing the methodology and the   Aqeedah of Ahl Assunnah Wal Jama'ah, and they \nhave grave mistakes, and some of these mistakes   can take someone out of the fold of Islam, we \ndon't say that they're out of the fold of Islam,   those who say these things that make them out \nof the fold of Islam, and we clarify it to them,   and we show them eveidence from the Quran \nand Sunnah, and they insist in this case it's   a different story, but generally speaking \nwould I pray in a Berelvis Masjid, never,   why would I? I'd rather pray in a normal Masjid, \nI'd pray in my hotel room rather than going to a   place where I know they have grave mistakes one of \nthem which you have mentioned that the Prophet ﷺ   was not created from clay like everyone else \nhe was created from the light of Allah and this   by itself is blasphemous to say such a thing, \nnow some of them may water it down and say no,   no we did not mean this we meant that and \nthis and that, but again this is something   that was not said neither in the Quran nor in \nthe Sunnah and claiming such a heinous claim   is unspeakable and should not slip so \ndefinitely do not pray there go somewhere else   or look for other Muslims who follow the Aqeedah \nof Ahl Assunnah Wal Jama'ah and pray with them."
