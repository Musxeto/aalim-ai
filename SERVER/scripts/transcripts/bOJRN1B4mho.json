  "transcript": "Misha from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum So I have this OCD problem and it's like one goes and another comes. So nowadays a lot of questions come to my mind like regarding free will, destiny and so on. So I keep telling myself in my mind that Allah is my Lord and I'm His slave and He can do whatever He wills and He wants and He's the most generous and I try to block the thoughts like this and move on. Because if I keep searching on like YouTube the waswasa comes again and again. So am I doing something wrong? No, no you are doing exactly what is correct according to Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. You have full belief and conviction and submission to Allah and you know that His will overwhelms all other wills and whatever He wills will happen. So what you're doing is the right thing."
