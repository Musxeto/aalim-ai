  "transcript": "Nasir, Nasir from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam Sheikh may Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala grant you Jannah and may Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala forgive you and forgive all your sins and guide you towards the afterlife and you as well and those listening to us as well Ameen Sheikh I had a question regarding the acting industry so what the situation is I'm a British South Asian Muslim from the UK I'm 22 years of age I'm a very creative individual like I have a passion for creative writing and performing I acknowledge that anything haram anything that takes you away from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala you should stay away from but my question is is it permissible for me to study acting or study performing or creative writing if it brings someone closer towards Islam if it raises awareness of issues such as domestic violence such as slavery such as where is Majid Majid not Majid sorry Nasir where's Nasir yeah so you want to write something about uh domestic violence slavery and what else uh studying performance you know acting okay let's let's be crystal clear when you study performance and acting in the west this usually involves dancing ballet uh improvising um sketches acting singing music all of this is haram if you tell me that I am in an academy that teaches halal things so they teach me how to act how to direct and there's no free mixing no women no music I will say yeah no problem you can act maybe write a play that talks about violence that talks about domestic abuse that talks about injustice haram things in Islam how to rectify it and fix the society without having women without having music which is very very unlikely to happen in the west but hypothetically assuming that you can do this and manage this and the content is good it's totally halal but realistically speaking to study such science quote unquote in the west involves 95 percent of haram and there's nothing that justifies this and I hope this answers your question"
