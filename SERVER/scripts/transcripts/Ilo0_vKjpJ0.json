  "title": "Anas Ibn Malik reports Prophet's ï·º Hajj",
  "transcript": "may allah be pleased with him narrates that when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam performed his hajj it was on a saddle and some sort of cloth that was worn out and costs only for dirham and maybe it does not cost that much even and when the prophet was started his journey for hajj he said and proclaimed o allah this is a pilgrimage where i do not show off in it and seek no reputation out from it so the intention of this hajj is sincerity pure and simple it is for the sake of allah there's no boasting there's no showing off there's no taking selfies as many people do you"
