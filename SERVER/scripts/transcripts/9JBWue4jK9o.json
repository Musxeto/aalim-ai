  "title": "Is saying Ghulam or servant of the Prophet ‎ﷺ Shirk? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] says in our country there is a group of people who say we are of the prophet here the bengali word means servant but my concern is that we are the only servants of allah is this statement shirk the word is what is usually associated with the names of allah such as abdullah abdul rahman abdul aziz etc so this cannot be used except with allah azzawajal unless it is to identify an actual slave that you bought with your money and he is asam for example and this is an inappropriate name but it is not shirk it's not haram and we know that the prophet salallahu's name is muhammad ibn is actually not a name of a god al-mutalib was the brother of hashem when when hashem sent his brother al-muttalib to fetch his son from medina when he came into mecca with his nephew and no one knew who that kid was so they thought that he was his slave so they called him abdul muttalib and he kept telling them his name is atik he's not a slave of mine he's a free man he's my nephew but the name was attached to him so he was known as abdul muttalib so the concept itself is not haram unless it is intended to now if in bengali language and i was told that this is true that means the servant or the slave of in this case it would be inappropriate to call a person the servant or the slave of the prophet because this would lead into extremism and to go deep in praising the prophet beyond what he deserves because he himself told us do not go too extreme in me later luffy like the jews and the christians did with their prophets and messengers merely i am a servant of allah and his messenger so we put him in the level that he himself put himself in and we put him in the level that allah azzawajal honored him with but without going into extreme and allah azzawajal knows best"
