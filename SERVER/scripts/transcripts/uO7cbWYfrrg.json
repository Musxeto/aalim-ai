  "title": "Can Latecomers make a Second Congregation? Shaykh Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "um faizan from india my question was the masjid near me is a little small compared to the average masjid one day some people came late to the prayer so one of the brothers told them not to make a second jama because it will disturb the people was this action of his right no it's not right when the congregation is over then and there is no sufficient space in the masjid those who had just prayed should have left so that they would give room to the late comers to make a second congregation not to stay there forever or to reside there so they have to be considerate of those late comers who are interested in performing their fart as long as you have performed your fart leave you"
