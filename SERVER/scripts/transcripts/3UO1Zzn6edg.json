  "transcript": "Mudathir from Russia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh I have a quite much a confusing question about the Jummah prayers. I am currently living in Saint Petersburg and the issue is that I have to travel almost 45 minutes to get to the nearest mosque. Like the nearest mosque by the metro is 45 minutes away. So is the Jummah prayers farz on me or I can pray the Zuhr at my dormitory? I am a student here. Akhi, the Jummah prayer is one of the most important prayers in the Muslim's life. And there is a chapter, one of 114 surahs in the Quran, by the name of Al-Jumu'ah. And scholars say that it is mandatory upon a person to attend the Jumu'ah if he is in a city where the Jumu'ah is being called for. So is it a must to attend it even if I do not hear the Adhan? This is an issue of dispute. To my knowledge, the majority of scholars say that you have to, even by car or taking the bus or the subway, to go to the masjid and be with the congregation and be with the Muslims and express your solidarity with the Muslims in Saint Petersburg Saint Petersburg or wherever you are by praying with them. And inshallah, Allah will reward you for that. And Allah knows best."
