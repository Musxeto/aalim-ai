  "transcript": "maryam says is it permissible for a woman to call her husband by his name the answer is yes what kind of question is this maryam i know that culturally some people tend to see this as taboo and a sign of disrespect so in some arab countries yes a woman does not call her husband by name she calls him cousin or even and in other countries they have other forms of respect but this is totally baseless and has nothing and i mean nothing to do with islam it's totally cultural in islam the hadith of the prophet isaiah when he was talking to aisha and he says by allah i know when you're angry with me the prophet is saying he knows when he's angry when she's angry with him and when you are pleased so she said how do you know this o prophet of allah he said when you are angry with me you you swear by the lord of ibrahim you say nay by the lord of ibrahim and when you're pleased with me you swear with me my name by saying nay by the lord of muhammad the prophet said smiled and said oh yes o prophet of allah i would only abandon your name which means that she used to call the prophet isa salam as her husband with his name so definitely by default any woman can call her husband by his name without a problem"
