  "transcript": "Muhammad from France alayum I'm a young student and I basically just had a question regarding um the ruling on amulets and uh wearing things that uh are given by certain doctors CU it's a practice in my culture and they're supposedly supposed to give you luck or uh yeah I guess success or protect you from harm so what's the ruling on that because I have some pressure from family to wear these sort of stuff or shower with them and yeah any any type of amulets or or talsman this is either minor shik if you wear them or put them on believing that Allah would save you or help you or give you good luck through it this is minor shik or major shik that takes you out of the fault of Islam if you think that this particular amulet or ring has magical powers and it will protect me it will bring me luck it would do this and that it would take you out of the fold of Islam even if you pray a gazillion times a day"
