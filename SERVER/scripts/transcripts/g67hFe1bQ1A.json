  "title": "How to deal with a disobedient wife? Her Islamic knowledge is Zero | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "says how to deal with a disobedient wife who cannot do anything but complaining her knowledge and actions in islam is nothing but zero first of all sometimes we tend to exaggerate in portraying a problem similar to yours cher because this is unimaginable how did you marry someone in the first place like that you should have done your due diligence you should have asked how her islamic knowledge is whether she's practicing or not you should have communicated with her before cancer mating the marriage when you got the contract written a month or two before consummating the marriage to know what level of a person she is to come after all these years and complain like this usually out of experience because i do a lot of counseling sessions so i sit with couples and i know their ins and outs i know with the grace of allah because of me i am experienced allah gave me and blessed me with the experience to be able to tell when the man is lying and when the woman is lying so to come after all these years complaining that she has zero in faith and knowledge and she's always complaining this is unacceptable and if we dig a little deeper we will find that most likely you simply don't like her at the moment and this is the result of months maybe years of bickering which she is at fault while you are also at fault a woman doesn't bicker or complain unless there are reasons for that maybe you don't provide for her maybe you don't spend time with the family maybe your abusive nature calls her to defend herself by being abusive herself maybe you're prioritizing your family over her and making them use her as a doormat serving them being a humiliated person that no one cares about in the home failing to provide her with her own separate accommodation so i cannot answer you because your answer is not objective it's one-sided i need to speak to the woman and face her with the complaints you have said against her and hear her defense i need to hear from you why these things all of a sudden popped up now and not years ago and this cannot be answered in a simple email and allah azza knows best"
