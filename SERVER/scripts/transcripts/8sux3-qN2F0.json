  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Anwar, here, the next question is from this little girl, please. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, my name is Alia, I am 10 years old and I wanted to ask, so do Shahids also get resurrection like other people even though they are guaranteed Jannah? I did not understand, can you repeat the question please? Can you repeat the question? Do Shahids get resurrection like normal people even though they are guaranteed Jannah? Very good, so the Shahid, which means the martyrs, who are the martyrs? They are the Muslims who die on the battlefield. This is called what? Shahid. We cannot testify that he is a Shahid. Why? He died on the battlefield because I don't know about his intention. He may have died to gain power. He may have died to get a rank. He may have died to gain booty of war. And he may have died because he wanted the name of Allah to be the highest. So if I say he is Shahid, I am saying he is in Jannah. And no one has the ability to say that. But when a person dies in the cause of Allah Azza wa Jal, he at the side of Allah is called a Shahid. Question, is the martyr who died in the cause of Allah in the battlefield? Sheikh, why are you repeating battlefield? Because I can be injured on the battlefield and go to the hospital and spend two weeks in the hospital and die. Am I Shahid? No. I have to be washed, shrouded, prayed upon, and buried like normal dead people. People who die on the battlefield, they are not washed. They are shrouded in their own clothes. And we do not offer Janazah prayer because we don't intercede for them. They intercede for us. And we just bury them. So this is the difference. So those who die martyrs in the battlefield. I give you my back because they will kill me if I don't, you know. Those who die on the battlefield, it's an issue of dispute. Is or will their bodies decompose or not? There are narrations that their bodies will not decompose. Evidence from that? Some narrations that Hamza, the uncle of the Prophet ï·º, after 20 years of his death, they dug his grave and found his body intact. And in another narration, Jabir ibn Abdullah ibn Haram. Jabir ibn Abdullah ibn Haram was also 40 years. The flood came and uncovered his body and his body was intact. But these are two cases. Other cases say no, they decompose. What we know for certain is that the bodies of whom? Messengers and Prophets. They do not decompose. They are intact and it can never happen any change to their bodies. They will be resurrected. But they will be resurrected, meaning the souls will be inserted into their bodies and they come back to life. If this is your question. So I hope I answered it. Okay? Barakallah fiki. Thank you very much, Sheikh."
