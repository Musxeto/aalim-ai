  "transcript": "sajid from the uk says that we have people that say that it's permissible to steal money from the non-muslims and this is unfortunately prevailing in such countries non-muslim countries why because the governments try to block anything that is authentic and real and in accordance with the quran and sunnah from coming their way they fight islam they fight nikab they fight hijab they fight segregation between the sexes they fight anything they can fight that is related to islam when you do this as a result you will have this type of people who would say that killing the disbelievers is okay stealing the money of the disbelievers is okay borrowing in riba and then not paying it back is okay and they start to justify every evil action just because these are non-muslims while if they were to allow the muslim scholars to come and preach and teach and open the people's eyes on the beauty of islam none of this would have happened now in my class last week i think who cares about the islamic faith akida we spoke about this concept that every kafir by default is halal to hurt and to take his money and i said that this is not true that the kafirs are four categories mentioned in the books of and in the fifth category that is not mentioned but but it's known by default so there is the vimy who is living in our country muslim countries and paying taxation there is the mustang and he is from a an enemy country but he's been given a permission to do a certain errand like ambassadors etc and then leave there is who their country and ours they have a pledge of uh or a treaty or not to attack one another we don't have enmity but we have this pledge like the most the majority of all countries worldwide and there is the harbi and the harbi is a person belonging to a country that is fighting us there are enemies this harbi who are our enemies we will not go and kiss on the cheek he is our an enemy we have fights and wars one another this is the one who is but all others are not and likewise if there's a country that we don't have any diplomatic relationships but we're not at war with so he's neither a vimy or a muahad or a mustafa we cannot transgress or attack or abuse or harm because he has not shown us any type of hostility or enmity therefore we do not fight with that such a person but they don't allow scholars to come and teach the people and this is what they are planning for and allah knows better"
