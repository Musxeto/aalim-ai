  "transcript": "sad from qatar he says we seem to have gotten on the wrong foot because when the call was taken all what i heard from him was and in arabia we have this wrong concept that if i'm disputing with someone or someone oppressed me i say hasbi allah as a threat not knowing that this is not a threat has be allah means allah will suffice me and when i am he's the one i trust and depend upon so this is not a dua against you this is declaring that i am trusting allah azza but people take it negatively so this is why i was joking around when i said to him what have i done to you"
