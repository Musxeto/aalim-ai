  "transcript": "San from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you doing Sheikh? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah Sheikh we know that as layman's we are supposed to learn some of the basics of Islam which is like knowing you're knowing you have to eat the five pillars of Islam and then the 99 names of Allah. My question was what are some of the other things we should know about? You should know the essentials that you would not be qualified to be a proper Muslim without such knowledge. For example if we say to you basic layman what should he know? You should say he should know that the five pillars of Islam the six pillars of Iman generally speaking not in details he's not a scholar so he should know how to pray. If someone doesn't know how to pray this is a problem. He should know everything related to prayer that he needs. The obligatory acts, the pillars, the sunnahs. He should know if he makes a mistake when to make sujud before or after salam. Fasting, what are the things that break his fast? When to fast? When to break the fast? Zakat, how much he should give in zakat? What are the thresholds? What are the type? These are the essentials that are related to our lives. Transactions, what is halal and what is haram? When this transaction is haram? When is it riba? When there is ambiguity? When there is a gambling in it? So how to refrain? And when it is halal? These are the essentials that deal with or are related to our lives and daily practices and Allah knows best."
