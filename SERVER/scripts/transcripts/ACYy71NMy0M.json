  "transcript": "okay my question is a person who is punctual in morning evening car after car after salat and the things that are recommended does he fall under the category of elmer fudd redoing the hadith is in arabic and the Prophet says I some that those who mentioned Allah a lot among the main men and women who remember Allah a lot among them will have long strides ahead of everyone else and will be the first to arrive so she's saying that if we observe our daily earth car punctually would we fall under this category it seems that no because this is what everybody else does but to go the extra mile and in addition to all of that you make vicar in times in between this would classify and Allah knows best"
