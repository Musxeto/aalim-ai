  "transcript": "I think we have Farhan from India, our last question. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Sheikh, I had a question regarding, you know, some people have created some torches which, you know, like red light torches which when on, you know, we can see, you know, the jinns and the, you know, the, what they say, the ghosts maybe, and there's some even, you know, some reels floating in Instagram, you know, depicting all these things, and there are also some, you know, mobile applications which are made, you know. To do what? I don't understand your question. Doing what? They have some applications in the mobile phone or, you know, they have created a torch from which we stay on the torch, and you can see the, you know, the jinns and theâ€¦ No, no, no, this is all baseless, and it is shirk to believe any such applications can show you the jinn, or can communicate with them, or can control them. All of this is nonsense, and it's all bogus, it's all in your mind. If you want things like that, your subconscious will play games on you and convince you that this is happening when there is no such reality to it, and this is totally prohibited, and Allah Azza wa Jall knows best."
