  "title": "Can we repeat after a recorded athaan? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "Siraj says what is the ruling to repeat the event if the Masjid uses recorded event should we still say the doer after the add-on for that so Raja asking about a scenario that is taking place in some messages around the world and that is they do not let a person called a van the van is the call for prayer so what you when you hear the man saying through loudspeakers Allah Akbar Allahu Akbar this is called a van and this shows you and is a sign and signifies you and informs you that the time of Prayer has begun so he's asking about in some places instead of a living person calling the event they bring a tape recorder and on time they just simply play it like in airports in some hotels and some molds so he says would we be recommended to repeat why would we repeat because the Prophet told us how I saw some that whenever you hear that van you repeat after the more other than whatever he says you you say Allah Akbar you say allah wa ashadu an LA ilaha ilallah a Shadowhunter rasoolallah you repeat that hi Alice salat hi ya lil fella he said a whole lot of Hotel Avila four times Allah Allah but etc to the end and then you offer salutation to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and ask allah for him that was sila which is a status and a level in jannah that is only allowed for one person to be there and the Prophet says I wish and hope that I am the one and he is the one without any doubt in that so the Prophet told us whoever does this would gain his intercession his chiffon so Raj is saying if I hear the Adhan being called from a recorder from a cassette so should I say it the answer is no because the Sunnah is to repeat after an event that is being live that is being recited by a human being who is doing it live recorded one does not give you any reward and this practice should be abolished should be stopped I then has to be called by a person because in few years time I would not any doubt I would not be amazed if I see in some of these new tech messages who have a new religion other than Islam you go to Germany you find a message it led by a woman and it's for homosexuals for transgenders for criminals or whatever any thing that comes and they say this is a message if you go to another message in another country and say this is a gay Muslim Masjid what is this tomorrow they're going to have rapists message for example this is not part of Islam so I would not suspect that maybe in a few years time you'll go to a Masjid in this European country where they have a robot new advanced from from Japan and he leads a prayer and Wow as today's is reciting or ashram is reciting and the robot is doing the prayer and people behind him this saves money saves time reduces errors you don't have to do so Judas so what kind of religion are these people playing with so definitely what's taking place is not part of the Sunnah"
