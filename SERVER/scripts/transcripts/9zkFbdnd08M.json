  "transcript": "Qul Hathihi Sabeeli Adh'u Ilallah Chaudhry from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam Sheikh yesterday I asked you a question about question but as my voice wasn't clear you understood the opposite of what I said my question was I know of some brothers with some good qualities but I do not want to send I do not want to send any mahrams to them because in our country it is considered shameful for the father of the female to go to the male so if I make dua to Allah for a righteous spouse is this sufficient for having tawakkul on Allah I really do not want to send anyone to them as this really is honor my father Jazakallahu Khairan Wa Jazakum. Well you can make dua and as long as this is a shameful act in your country and you know that there are no other halal means and proper means to approach this suitor who's not even a suitor he doesn't know anything about you making dua is the only option you have but I wouldn't do a lot of or I won't put a lot of weight on such dua because we are instructed to take the means so if I see something or if I want to gain something if there is a particular science I would like to learn if there is a particular language and there are so many that I would like to pick and learn if I don't sit and learn and I just make dua it's not going to come through thin air therefore I wouldn't be doing proper tawakkul when I say okay I made tawakkul to Allah that he teaches me Spanish I want to learn Spanish this won't happen or I want to pick up Bahasa this won't happen unless I go and sit down in a classroom or actually communicate with those who can teach me so that I can pick up this language making dua is not sufficient I hope this answers your question and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all"
