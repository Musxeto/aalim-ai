  "transcript": "zach from the uk is asking a frequently asked questions a lot of the people say what about when we wash our private parts after answering the call of nature and we feel splashes either there are splashes or there are no splashes how do i know you can touch the area and if this dry then you know that this is whispers of shaytan move on okay if there are splashes we find witness this witness either it's pure or impure how would we know we're not going to take a sample to the lab and ask them to analyze it to check it out the vast majority the the vast issues is that if the water in the toilet seat has impurities then definitely these splashes are impure with wet hands you can wipe the area of your body and that's it end of the issue you don't have to go down in the shower but if the vast majority of water in the toilet seat is pure because you've used a lot of water to purify yourself maybe you flushed it then you washed yourself then the default is it's pure until proven otherwise so you have these two possibilities either way you don't have to go to the to the shower and wash all of yourself or spend like four minutes or three minutes washing or cleaning yourself if there are spots of impurities or what you have to do with wet hands just wipe it and it is clean inshallah"
