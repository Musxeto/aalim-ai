  "title": "Parents don't like hijab so I wear it secretly, sinful if I don't wear it sometimes? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Elisa from Belgium Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh My friend absolutely wants to wear the hijab, but her parents don't agree at all and the majority of her family are unfortunately not practicing and think that the hijab should be put on when you are older or after getting married and she was wondering if she was sinful because she decided to wear but in secret so she puts it on when she leaves the house and when her parents aren't there but it's hard for her at all times to hide her hair because sometimes there are non-mahrams from her family who come to her house and so she doesn't hide her hair so as not to arouse suspicion can she continue like this until her parents completely accept the hijab? Allah Azza Wa Jal says in the Quran Fear Allah to the best of your ability which means that we have to implement shariah in our lives regardless of what others say even if they were our parents who we are ordered to obey but who ordered us to obey them? Allah so is it logical to obey them while disobeying Allah? definitely not so if Allah mandated hijab upon women they must abide by it even if their parents force them not to now here we come to weigh the pros and cons if a woman says my parents threaten me and scold me and tell me not to wear the hijab so what do I do sheikh? I ask is it all bark but no bite? or are they lunatics and crazy? if she says no they just impulsive and they get angry but they don't carry out what they threaten in this case be diplomatic but ignore what they're saying to you and abide by the sharia by time they will accept it if you say no they have criminal records and they have done this in the past and they can injure me they can kick me out of the house and I'll be in more trouble if I do this for real in this case the threat is genuine and real so fear Allah to the best of your ability try to cover whenever you are capable of doing this if you're non-mahram come to the home lock yourself in and don't cover but don't mix with them to the best of your ability and may Allah make things easy for you"
