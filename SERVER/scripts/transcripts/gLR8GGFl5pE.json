  "transcript": "uh brother Sammy from the U.S so my question is um you said I think before if someone gets doubts every single day I thought there's a lot they should not perform to Judah so when they should go with their gut feeling but my question is what if they don't go what their gut feeling and they do so do they sell who every single Salah like what an unnecessary said you would have said will break their Salah and invalidate it it would not break there's a lot and invalidated if they have doubts but this is not the proper way of curing a person's OCD so OCD is something that is intrusive that jumps on you if you write the tide and go with the flow you will suffer more and more if you ignore it if you don't pay any attention to it after a while Satan will be fed up and he will notice that you're progressing so he tells his boys and thugs to stop temporarily until you put your guard down and then they attack again so yes you should if you're getting these doubts every single day to go with your gut feeling and not offer sujuda sahu but if you're so insisting you feel that no this is not something that I can apply my gut feeling because I'm uh I'm a telemo I'm totally in the dark I don't know whether this is the second or the third for real and there's no gut feeling in it then yes you can perform this Knows Best"
