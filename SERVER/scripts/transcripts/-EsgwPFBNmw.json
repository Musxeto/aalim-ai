  "transcript": "Abdul from India. Okay Sheikh, so the question is regarding what to do with finding a lost valuable item. Okay, so it's a scenario based question so I may take a little longer. So the incidence is of 2005 where my sister found a gold necklace pendant. Okay, to make matters worse it was a Hindu, it has a Hindu's OM symbol on it. Now what happened is she approached my dad. My dad, due to I don't know, he says he enquired in and around but as per I don't think he enquired as per the one year, you know. Due to lack of knowledge, ignorance or greed he decided to keep it. Fast forward 2021, what happened is he consulted local Muftis and it was with us and local Mufti said it's been a long time. Okay, so what you can do is you can give the charity and use it for yourself. So he says in equivalence of maybe Saudi Riyal 3000 he gave it to charity and he gave it to my sister. He added some more gold and my sister is using as a necklace. Now my question is that I feel we did not do enough back then. I was small and maybe because of lack of knowledge he didn't do much to give it to the right person. And I feel because of that there's a lot of bad energy, negative energy or marriages are getting, I feel marriages getting delayed. We're always confused about picking spouses or I mean potential spouses or decisions and we lost even our mother due to unusual bad health treatment. So I want to know what, now my dad says he did give in equivalence of 3000 Saudi Riyal. I can't validate that. Assuming he did in goodwill, I don't want to pressurize him, keep asking him. So okay, Akhi, in terms of your question, first of all your vibes and negative feelings and whatever is all bogus has nothing to do with this. This is all from your own demons and your own thinking. It has nothing to do with this necklace. What he did was wrong. He should have notified the authorities and those in the adjacent areas of a valuable item lost and waited a whole year. Because he did not do that, he has no right in it. Hence, he has to evaluate how much it costs at the present time and give the amount to charity or give it itself to charity. If he did not do that, but he just evaluated it and truthfully gave the money that it is worth to charity, then your sister can keep it, providing it's halal. It doesn't have any symbols of Hinduism or of shirk or statues, etc. And there is nothing wrong with that. Your mom's death and the proposals that have been lost has nothing to do with that at all. He has to ask Allah for forgiveness and repent. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all. Al Fatiha."
