  "title": "Praying Asr when the athaan of maghrib was called, should I break prayer & offer maghrib? assim al",
  "transcript": "And my second question is for myself. Let's say I was on an event and it is like on the edge of prayer time. Like let's say it's 5.40 and Maghreb is 5.50 and I haven't prayed Asr. Once I was, once I prayed Asr, I go in and I was at the second, third rakah and then the Azan came. Should I cancel it or I continue it? I understand. JazakAllah Khair. It is very dangerous to delay Asr prayer until before Maghreb. This is the way of the hypocrites when they pray. The Prophet says Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, Al-Munafiqo. The hypocrite waits until the sun is about to set, he goes and prays quickly. But if you pray one full rakah, Rukoor, two sujood, Allahu Akbar, you stand up before sunset, your prayer is valid. You continue InshaAllah. I hope this answers your question."
