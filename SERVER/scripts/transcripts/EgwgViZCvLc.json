  "title": "The unmatched preservation of Qur'an",
  "transcript": "show me a scripture that has been preserved in its original original form that it was revealed in you will not find that even the bible you will not find that the quran is preserved as it was revealed and its preservation is both written and memorized so the tens of millions of people who memorize it by heart if we were to come to the copies of the quran worldwide and burn them and destroy them today these 10 million people will sit down and write the same identical quran letter by letter you cannot make a mistake in the quran and be unnoticed i would recite the quran in prayer in my congregation and a nine-year-old child behind me if i make a mistake in the recitation he would raise his voice during prayer to correct me and i would rectify my mistake and correct it and after the prayer is over i go and thank that child for preserving the quran no other scripture has this no one can claim"
