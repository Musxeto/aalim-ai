  "title": "Does listening to ruqyah on Youtube exclude me from the 70,000? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh If I understand correctly, seeking Ruqya excludes you of the 70,000 who will enter Paradise without being brought to account. But listening to a recorded Ruqya, for example on YouTube, comes under the heading of seeking Ruqya and excludes you of the 70,000? And is any surah or verse allowed listening to for the purpose of Ruqya? First of all, the hadith you're referring to is an authentic hadith, where the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said once to his companions, 70,000 of my Ummah, 70,000 of my Ummah will enter Paradise without torment or accountability. And he went to his chambers, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. So the companions started to dispute among one another. One says they are the children who were born in Islam and were not affected to Kufr. Others said they are the martyrs in the cause of Allah. A third party said this. When the Prophet came out again to them from his chambers, from his room, and saw them arguing, he explained to them, elaborated on who fits the description of the 70,000. And he said they are the people who do not la yastarqoon, wa la yaktawoon, wa la yatatayyaroon, wa ala rabbihim yatawkaloon. They are the people who do not ask others to perform Ruqya for them. The other three I won't mention. So if I'm sick, if I'm suffering from evil eye, and I go to a raqi or to a person seeking his assistance in offering Ruqya to me, I do not fit in the 70,000 category. Because I was inclined in dependence and reliance, partially, not on Allah 100%, rather on this individual, which is not haram. The Prophet said, alayhis salatu was salam, man istata'a minkum ayanfa'a akhaahu falyafa'al. Whoever is capable of benefiting his brother, he should do so. So if someone comes to you and asks you for Ruqya, you should do so. You're rewarded for that. He is not doing something sinful, but it reduces his amount of tawakkul on Allah. So he's exempted from the 70,000. He could qualify with other deeds to enter Jannah without accountability or torment. But this is not our point. Now if someone comes and offers me Ruqya, I'm sick, I'm suffering, when someone comes to visit me and he sees me and he says, allahu la ilaha illa huwa al hayyu al qayyum wa la ta'khudhu huwa sinatun wa la naam, or alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen, and he blows on me, there's no problem in that. If I do Ruqya on myself and wipe or do Ruqya on water and drink, there's no problem in that. I'm still qualifying inshaAllah. If I listen to Ruqya on the internet or on a cassette, or if you still remember what a cassette is, or on a DVD player or whatever, this is also, there's no problem in that because I did not go and seek such assistance from another person and I hope this answers your question."
