  "transcript": "[Sheikh: Salhin from Canada.] [Salhin: Sheikh, my question is, if we do\nnot say 'Radi Allahu 'anha' after the names of mothers of the believers, or 'Radi Allahu\n'anhum' after the names of the sahaba, is it a sign of hatred or disrespect towards\nthem? BarakAllahu feekum.] [Sheikh: Wa feekum barakAllah. I will answer you, in sha Allah.] Salhin from Canada. He says, 'if someone says 'Abu Bakr' and moves\non, he does not say 'Radi Allahu 'anhu (may Allah be pleased with him)', would that be\na sign of hatred?' The answer is 'No'. It's not mandatory to say radi Allahu 'anhu. It is something recommended. It's highly rewardable. It indicates your respect and love. But if you don't say it, either for forgetfulness\nor due to the fact that you're reading a paragraph that includes names of the companions a gazillion\ntime, and you'd like to minimize the time or the effort, there's no problem in that. There's no sign of hatred. The hatred is in the heart. The hatred is in what appears in your tongue\nwhen you speak ill about them, or you criticize them, or you belittle them, this is a sign\nof hatred."
