  "transcript": "yunus from Germany um can you give us a general ruling how to behave when we doubt whether something is Haram or not and I don't mean that I doubt everything to be Haram but sometimes I get in a situation which in which my parents tell me to do something I don't know whether it's hard enough so so that I'm excused for for um for disobeying them or when I doubt isn't that inv validates when I doubt that is cheating thing is this is this is something that you have to seek knowledge and know the limitations that Allah had set for you in the Quran and the Sunnah there isn't any magical pill that you can take where you can simply identify what's Halal andam and this is why you have to seek knowledge and learn your religion learn the Quran and apply common sense and logic in cases that you don't have a concrete proof and also apply the default which states that everything is halal until proven otherwise such generic questions won't take you anywhere you have to investigate and when you overthink this is when Shan sets his biggest trap for you and this would make you doubt everything this is the process of overthinking what if this what if that what if my father says what if my mother says what if I'm doubtful if it's Haram or not what if it's sh what if I committed this thing and this nullifies my Salat this is all overthinking and from Shan"
