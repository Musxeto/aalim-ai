  "transcript": "Qul Hathihi Sabeeli Adu'oo Ila Allah Insalam from Australia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh my question is a little bit long but I'll try and keep it brief so please be patient with me I beg you please make it as short as possible Okay so there's a young Muslim mother who's 23 years old She has two children under the age of three She's separated from her husband and isn't likely to reunite with him and there might have been some domestic violence She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't want her baby Now she doesn't have good mental health and the problem is her two children have a health condition where if they're not fed properly they're at risk of death and the child protection they wanted to her and if she doesn't meet the requirements of you know giving the children nourishment they might take the children away so her new child that she's pregnant with is likely to have the same condition and she doesn't think that she can cope with having another baby on her own and doesn't have good family support and if her children are taken away from her it's possible that they won't even be put with other Muslims like with other relatives of hers or other Muslims at all so the children can be given back to her if they're taken away if she's trying to have good progress so basically under her circumstances would she be allowed to have an abortion? How old is the pregnancy? I'm not exactly sure unfortunately I don't have that information Okay, first of all these situations Zahi cannot be answered over the phone there are so many details that need to be investigated but in a nutshell because we don't have the capacity to go into details and to talk to the sister and to see the background and the circumstances of her situation it is not permissible to abort a pregnancy after it is 40 days of age because now it is the majority of scholars say that this is haram before the age of 40 days it's an issue of dispute I'm inclined to say that this is like taking the after pill so 40 days or less you can opt for abortion without any sin insha'Allah after that this becomes prohibited unless there is proof that there is real potential genuine risk on the mother's life secondly or thirdly of those count in her case I would highly recommend that she book tickets and flee the country this country is known to be hostile towards Muslims like many other countries and they would do anything to abduct your children and in a heartbeat they would give them to Christian families and they would be happy and to challenge this you would probably take two or three years in their court and if you were to win the harm had already been done and I know cases that came to me for counselling Alhamdulillah the brother won and he got his child back but after what after false accusation from the nurse that they were abusing their own child and they are practicing Muslims and I told this brother I don't know if he's watching or not to just flee the country don't stay there your capital is your Islam and then your family so I would highly recommend that she runs away from that country at least until she gets her things settled if this is not possible my second option would be as an advice is for her to give her own two children to Muslim families for temporarily adoption of five to ten years explaining her case and documenting it with the government so that they would not file any legal cases against her or do anything now their their hands are tied so legally they can't abduct her children anymore and trying to bear with her third child coming making dua that Allah makes him healthy and not having that same disease Allah is capable of doing that and Allah knows best Abu Abdel and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it and that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and be it in Allah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all be it in Allah"
