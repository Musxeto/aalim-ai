  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Canada Shiekh I have a \nquestion regarding recitation during salah   so my question is if I'm praying alone if \nIm praying alone at home does the recitation   during salah does it have to be such that \nI have to hear an audible whisper or is it   sufficient to just move my tongue without \nany audible whisper so what is the minimal   requirement for reciting silently when I'm \nreciting alone or within the congregation   the minimal requirement is to just simply move \nyour tongue and lips so if you just do this that is more than sufficient and its valid 100%   however its a bit recommended that you hear \nyour self and this adds a great deal of   khusoo and concentration to your \nprayer so actually when you say its a whispering like I can hear without \nannoying those next to me some people   unfortunately cant control this so you may \nbe praying next to a brother and he would say thinking that he only can hear while two to \nthree people to his right and left are also   participating in his listening unwillingly to him \nand this is annoying a lot of the people may be   annoyed by this after the salah probably they'll \npick a fight saying Akhi I couldn't recite my   own Fatihah you're distracting us keep it down and \nthey're right so you should keep it down so if you   don't make a sound at all your prayer is totally \nfine and if you make a hissing sound where you can   distinguish a little bit your own recitation \nthat is more liked and better Inshaa Allah"
