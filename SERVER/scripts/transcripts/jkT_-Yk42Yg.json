  "transcript": "via Isaiah says can I do to off for other people as many times as I want after completing my Umbra the essence of our religion is based on following what do we mean by that we cannot innovate we cannot invent things we have to follow and comply to the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so when the Prophet says alayhi salatu salam the prayer of a man in congregation is 27 times better than his prayer alone what do we understand we understand that prayer in congregation is far more rewarding okay this is hadith we put it a little bit on the side the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam that if you maintain praying twelve rak'ahs per day and night other than the four Allah then Allah will build you a mansion in Jannah and of the live in Omar and on Habiba and and umm Salama and all the mothers of the believers told us that the Prophet used to pray for Rocca's before the  or two rakahs before in a hadith of and Omar and for Raqqa and the hadith of the mothers of the believers and two Rakas after okay said okay I I could not agree more okay what happens if I come in the Masjid I lead the congregation in four raka of war and after I finish the fault of versa RAM and I offer the Salam I say to them brothers let us now pray the Sunnah two Rakas after the in congregation is the air tell you optimist of a cumulative telephone what is this hey Dad come what are you doing so I say what do you think I'm doing I'm praying congregation I'm leading them in sunnah prayer see yeah but this is not permissible so why the Prophet said that the prayer in congregation is 25 to 27 times more rewarding than praying alone so I'm praying the Sunnah which a prophet always did in congregation what's wrong in that I said sure what's wrong is that the Prophet had never done it before so you're mixing oranges with apples yes congregational prayer is recommended for fault this is what the Prophet used to pray that is awesome and for taraweeh this is what the Prophet used to pray in congregation but he never had prayed the voluntary Sunnah emphatic Sunnah of the prayers in congregation so what you're doing is an innovation so now coming back to your question what's the ruling on going doing Tawaf for others was it ever recommended or done by the Prophet Isis Salam nope companions nope tapping no tabi tabi nope then what was we know that from authentic hadith that you can perform hajj bedell you can perform hajj on behalf of others this is our living providing that they are chronically ill and they are unable to perform that for Hajj this is permissible we know that you can perform Umrah for the deceased without any problem as long as you have performed your own umbra before but to do Tov we refrain you can do to offer yourself as many as you wish but you cannot do it on behalf of the deceased or the living for any reason none whatsoever and Allah knows and knows best"
