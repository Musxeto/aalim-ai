  "transcript": "Yunus for Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I have a big problem. So, in school, there's mixed sports class. And now the thing is, it's once a week for 70 minutes. And, you know, so they tell us to cooperate, to run around. There's risk of bumping into each other, of touching. Now, the thing is, I want to have a good job. I'm in advanced class, I'm good in school. Can I at least do so much so that I won't fail and have to become janitor? You know, this may include playing basketball with them or with girls or like playing football or badminton. So, I keep my distance in school. I'm known. Okay, I think we've lost Yunus. But the question is clear. What's the ruling on those who study in a kafir country, and they indulge in physical education classes, and they're forced to play with the opposite gender? I say, there is no compromise in religion. And there is a red line that we Muslims cannot cross. Who defines this red line? It's the Qur'an, the Sunnah. So, if they force you to go into physical education class, okay, and it's mixed, and it's mixed. Okay. And part of the class that you have to play together. Okay. And one of the classes, there is Romanian wrestling. So, you have to grapple and wrestle with the opposite gender. Okay. No, it's not okay. Well, we have to jump in the swimming pool, and maybe play a water polo, or whatever they call it. And this may encounter some physical contact. But I don't want to work as a janitor. Well, this is up to your preference. When you come to Islam, there is a red line you cannot cross. And all what you're mentioning is crossing these red lines. What is the limit? After the PE class, we have to take a shower. Interesting. And they don't have any gender segregation. Okay, what's next? Go to boot camp, and stay there for a week in bunkers? This is not Islam. This has nothing to do with Islam. Go back to your country. Don't stay in this kafir country. You will be compromising your religion. Either you put your foot down, and use all diplomatic and legal means to say that, this is my religion, I cannot go against my religion. And try to fight it. Fight the system. Until you make a precedent for you and all Muslims to have dignity and honor in their religion. All what they want is for you to be melted in the same melting pot. You have to behave like them. Act like them. One day, during Ramadan, you will have to be forced to eat pork, and maybe break bread together, or drink wine, the blood of Christ. I don't know. But Allah said it in the Quran, وَلَن تَرْضَى عَنْكَ الْيَهُودُ وَلَا النَّصَارَةُ حَتَّى تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ O Muhammad, the Jews and the Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their way, their religion. So, I think enough is enough. You have to draw the line, and choose whether you want this dunya, or you want the akhira. As long as you're implementing the Quran and the sunnah without any extremism, without any unnatural choices, all of this has to fall under the guidelines of Islam, from the Quran and the sunnah, and real scholars of Islam who follow the Quran and sunnah, not the diluted scholars. I'm talking about the real scholars who follow the Quran and the sunnah with the wisdom, and with the knowledge, and with the diplomacy, would understand how to treat such issues, and Allah knows best."
