  "title": "You are the CHOSEN ONE, where's your gratitude to Allah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Allah. There is nothing I could do. And this is an ayah we should all ponder upon. You watching me, you're Muslim with the grace of Allah. The majority of you are Muslims by birth and there are those whom Allah guided them to revert to Islam. You are the chosen Muslim. Allah has given you this beautiful religion on a plate of gold or silver. You should be grateful and show your gratitude and remain steadfast on Islam when you look at those whom Allah did not will to guide. The poor atheists, agnostics, Jews and Christians, idol worshippers, Hindus, Sikh and the likes, the Buddhists, Allah did not will to guide them and they will end up in hell fire. They chose, they had everything in front of them. They had the evidences to prove to them that Islam is the religion of Allah. They turned their back, they shrugged their shoulders, said, not interested, not convinced and they will pay dearly with depression in this life and with hell fire in the hereafter. As for you, what did you do to show your gratitude to Allah? Have you prayed Fajr this morning in the Masjid? Are you observing your fast as Allah wanted you to? Are you giving in charity? Are you reciting the Quran? Are you doing your Adhkar? Are you committed to Islam as Allah wants you to? If yes, then this is the grace of Allah Azza wa Jal."
