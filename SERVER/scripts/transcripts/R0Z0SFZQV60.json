  "transcript": "he gets feelings that he might be prostrating rather than allah so like what is the way he can make his intention to prostrate to allah only okay your fl your friend has a mental problem due to not going back to the basics one of the reasons we're deviating from the straight path is overthinking a man who performs wudu why are you performing wudu for the sake of allah he walks to the masjid why are you walking to the masjid i want to pray the prayer that allah ordered me he stands in line in rome facing the qibla and anticipates the imam inaugurational prayer or once the imam says allahu akbar the man says himself allahu akbar allah is the greatest greater than any of everything all of this he is fine with the moment he goes for raku and sujud he gets these thoughts that oh i'm frustrating for someone else so one of two either you are prostrating for someone else then this is not logical it doesn't make any sense why are you in the masjid why are you praying to begin with the hell with everything else go and commit kuffar and drink booze and have women why abide by islam which is not the case you're not here because you're a kafir or you have doubts you're here to pray so the second reason or option or whatever that you're getting these thoughts because satan wants to take you out of prayer and make you stop praying and maybe manage to take you out of the fold of islam because of the state of despair that you're in i'm prostrating to someone else you know you're not you know that you're not if i ask you a straightforward question but i have these thoughts you are certain that you're not doing it for other than allah but these thoughts are random intrusive thoughts that shaytan is putting them in your head how to counter this by simply blocking it don't think about it and if you get these thoughts if you're praying alone increase your frustration so instead of 10 seconds make it half a minute instead of half a minute make it three minutes so that would kill shaytan softly and you will inshallah win over that you"
