  "title": "Repeat ALL Invalid Prayers? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum So Sheikh, if I look at the past, there are many prayers over which I don't know whether I have to repeat them or not. Some are like a few weeks ago, some are distant in the past, and in some of them I'm like almost certain I have to repeat them, and others I simply don't know. So can I just draw the line and say I'm not going to repeat everything because in all in all there are like over 100 prayers or must I ask a fatwa for each and every scenario? No, most likely you cannot repeat them due to the fact that you did not pray them immediately once you figured out that they were invalid and this negligence from your side renders making them up not possible. So draw the line, move on, repent to Allah, show Allah sincere remorse over such negligence, and do a lot of good deeds and pray to Allah that He forgives you."
