  "transcript": "Saleha from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi I was praying Maghreb, my husband came from outside and thought that I was pronouncing incorrectly I don't understand, I don't understand what you're saying Saleha, your line is not clear Hello Yes, while you're praying Maghreb My husband came from outside and thought that I was pronouncing incorrectly Instead of saying Allahu Akbar, I was saying Allahu Akbar So I was in prayer, he tried to do prostration of Salat Before Salam, since this was a mistake in Maghreb, but after my prayer, when I asked him I want to know that he told me to do tribute for mispronouncing Kaaf incorrectly I told him that you heard it wrong, I was correct in my recitation And sometimes I mispronounce Kaaf, but I'm not sure whether it was correct this time Is my prayer valid for additional tribute of Sauh? Okay, Saleha, if I understand your question If you pronounced Allahu Akbar correctly and he heard it differently And you're certain that you've said it correctly There is no Sujud Al-Sauh for you And you don't have to believe him And you can move on"
