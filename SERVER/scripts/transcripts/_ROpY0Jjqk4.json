  "transcript": "ramadan but without with my ignorance i paid it in a form of a ramadan basket to a charity company a charity for the first and then after that i figure out that the cat should be paid in a cash to the poor people not in a form of buying some stuff for in on their behalf so should i repay again i paid 70 of my zakat in the form to a charity so those companies so charities they should be responsible of delivering that to the poor people so what do you recommend these 70 of your zakat are charity inshallah they are sadaqa and you have to pay it again in cash to the poor in the form of a zakat and allah would not let this go in vain the 70 percent you bought these baskets ramadan baskets they are charity they are sadaka and they are accepted by allah but they cannot be from your zakat you"
