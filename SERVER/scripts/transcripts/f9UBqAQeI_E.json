  "title": "Does eating camel's meat break Wudu? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "number four eating camel's meat and I said earlier that this is wrong this is not a misconception this is a fact in Islam that eating camel's meat invalidates your boodle however the vast majority of scholars and schools of thought support the opinion that it does not impact your Woodill so now we are at a fork of the road why would the scholars differ over such an issue well if you trace back the origin you'll find that in the beginning according to Jabbar in Abdullah may Allah be pleased with the man with his father he said that in the beginning the Prophet ordered us to perform Woodill from anything that was cooked with fire so in the beginning anything that was cooked whether it was meat or vegetables as long as it was touched it was barbecued it was grilled with fire then you have to perform Woodill off from it and then this ruling was abrogated so it was mandatory in the beginning once it was abrogated and abrogation is Anessa once it was abrogated then a new ruling came which stated that you don't have to perform woudl from anything that was touched by a with fire okay okay then we go to another hadith and this hadith is inside a man Muslim which is totally separate from the subject of the first hadith in this hadith albirroja has it and also Jabbar Abdullah may Allah be pleased with them all they say that the Prophet was asked at his salat wa sir with different wording of the hadith of course shall we pray in the places where a of sheep stays so it's like a barn can we can we pray where sheep stay the Prophet said yes can we or do we have to perform woudl from eating mutton meat the Prophet said if you wish okay then immediately the companion said can we pray in the barn where camels stay the Prophet said no and then they asked him can do we have to perform Woodill from camels meat and the Prophet said that is well yes so Imam Muhammad have been humble for example looked at the hadith it's highly authentication sorry I'm a Muslim we have no doubt in the authenticity of Muslims hadith and then he said okay this is clear-cut comparison between mutton and camels meat Martin if you eat it after you you want to perform although you don't want to your rule is intact but camels meet the Prophet said no you have to perform model the vast majority of scholars looked at this hadith of jabberin Magdalene said yeah yeah but this was related to it being cooked and Abdullah of the jabber jabber Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father told us that the last thing of the prophets instruction and command are a solo Salam was not to perform woudl of which what was cooked with fire the issue of being cooked with fire and eating comes wait are two different separate things that altogether they're not related none whatsoever to one another so you cannot simply cancel the hadith of a Muslim and say it does not impact your rule it does impact you why lanos this is a command from Allah so gel we have to comply with the funny thing is that people circulate in fabricated hadith not that it is a weak hadith it is not found anywhere in the books of Sunna in the books of hadith somebody just fabricated it and said it and people he said kept on repeating it and the hadith states that the Prophet was with his companions may allah be pleased with them and they had just finished eating camels meet all of them in there it was a feast it was whatever so they all ate from this meal and one of the companions passed wind and it was audible so he was embarrassed and it was immediately afterwards that a sir prayed was called so they all had to go and pray and none of them needed woudl so the Prophet Allah saw some just to save face of that person or did all of them to perform model what kind of nonsense is this do you think that the Prophet SM would burden his whole Ummah for just a certain specific person who passed wind definitely this is nonsense and it's unfair to claim that the Prophet would do such a thing sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and this hadith has no basis none whatsoever"
