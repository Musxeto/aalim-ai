  "transcript": "foreign [Music] says if a married man sucks the breasts of his wife after pregnancy and drinks milk from it does it void their marriage first of all this is not natural for a grown-up man to suckle his at this age you can go and buy some coffee or cappuccino or drink milk if you're interested but to do this is a bit ridiculous and weird nevertheless does the prohibition continue and is he considered to be a child of his wife through suckling the answer is no because the conditions of prohibition and for the child or for the individual to be the son of the woman who suckled him there are two conditions number one that the child is below two years of age so if the child is over two years of age then this does not make that individual or child a son of the um what mother witness or whatever they call her the second condition is that the sucklings should be five meals not just uh um one or two meals rather five full meals that the child leaves the breast willingly because he had enough five meals within the two years span of the child's uh age and after that the suckling does not work and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign"
