  "title": "Asking others for Dua & forgiveness before going to Hajj or Umrah | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "her second question is that it's a custom in our country whenever we want to go for Hajj that we go to our relatives and loved ones asking them for forgiveness and we go to the elders asking them for dua is this from the Sunnah and if I do not do this does that invalidate my Hajj the answer is no to both it is not from the Sunnah and it does not have any impact on your hatch on the contrary it's an innovation showing off and calling people forgive me if you had wronged them usually you should have asked forgiveness before and if you did not wronged them don't ask them for forgiveness just simply say listen I'm going next week to Hajj just wanted to tell you why go this detour for nothing so this is not from the Sunnah if you go without even telling them there is no problem in that asking them for dois is not from the Sunnah as many people think and it has no impact on your hatch or Umrah"
