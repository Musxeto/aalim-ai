  "transcript": "the other says if island people money do I have to pace the cat on that money this depends on the pattern the money is mine whether it's in the back under the mattress or I lend it to someone if I lend you money let's say ten thousand dollars my wealth has a particular day in the year let's assume it's the first of ramadan so when the first Ramadan comes I have to call you I'm the father the $10,000 I given you as a loan I need it back please if you say well I I don't have money at the moment it's it's difficult times with the lockdown and so and so so give me some time I think no problem I give you some time I don't have to pay the catch on the first of all Madan because I'm unable to retrieve my money so every few months I check on you the second Ramadan comes the father said well I don't have money and it goes on for 10 years without him repaying my money I don't give zakat any of these years after 10 years he says here's the $10,000 cycle ahead for waiting I give to 2.5% which is $250 zakat for the whole duration but if I gave up the other $10,000 and when it is time for my zakat my wife says call him and ask him for the money said well I'm too too embarrassed if he had that he would have given it back I'm shy of asking him in this case every single leader have to give from my own pocket 250 dollars there's a cat money for that and Allah who Sol knows best"
