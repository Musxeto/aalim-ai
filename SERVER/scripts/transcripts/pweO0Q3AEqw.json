  "title": "Is it permissible to offer 2 rakats on Friday when Imam comes in and gives Salam",
  "transcript": "Nor from Nigeria. Sheikh, my question is when I go for Jumaa prayer, sometimes I go before the time enters. So I will bring my two rak'ahs and sit down. Then I will see some people when the Imam comes, after he sits down, some people will offer two rak'ahs. So basically, Noor's question was, what's the ruling on people offering two rak'ahs when the Imam comes and says on Friday, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh and sits down? So they immediately stand up to pray two rak'ahs. This is an innovation. And it's not permissible. And it's prohibited. They are not allowed to do this. If the Imam comes and gives the Salam, you are only permitted to pray two rak'ahs if you come late before you sit down. Other than that, if you're sitting already, no, you are not allowed to stand up and pray when the Imam comes to give the Salam. Allah knows best. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all. Al Fatiha."
