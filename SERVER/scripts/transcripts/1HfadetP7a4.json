I don't know if it's something that is beneficial or not, but we will see In Sha Allah. If it's not, sue me. What can you do? I'm already here. They paid for the ticket. Alhamdulillah. I'll have a good two weeks time In Sha Allah and go back home without a problem. So, I will speak about the Islamophobe. Now, when you say phobia, this is the fear of something. So, there are people who have phobia."
