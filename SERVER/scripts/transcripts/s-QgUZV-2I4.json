  "transcript": "Abdul Mateen from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh I have some health issues I want to tell it to my teacher he teaches Quran but I want to tell him secretly because if I tell him in front of my Muslim friends they will bully me so I am afraid of being bullied I want to tell him secretly Sheikh Sheikh is this showing off Jazakallahu Khair Wa Jazak there is no shirk and there is no showing off and there is no kuffar in that none whatsoever but if you're afraid of people bullying you you have to be certain that your teacher would not leak your secret because if it's a secret keep it as a secret don't tell people about it leave it between you and Allah Azza wa Jal there is a possibility once you tell someone that they would tell another and then it would not become a secret anymore but concealing it from the others so that they would not bully you there is no problem in that it's very normal and natural"
