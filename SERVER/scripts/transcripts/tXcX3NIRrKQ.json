  "transcript": "iman says what's the ruling on making paper animals i mean origami if i understand this correctly origami is a form of art where they bring folded papers and they cut it with scissors in a certain fashion and then when they open it it gives the portrait of a person or an animal or a tree or a form of art so what's the ruling on that if it is a living creature such as a human being a an animal a fish a bird these living creatures that have a soul must not be portrayed drawn or sculptured so if this origami is a sculpture that has the 3d shape of an animal this is totally prohibited even if there were no facial features but if it's a 2d it's a one side it's like one paper not a statue or a structure without any facial features this seems to be permissible insha allah you"
