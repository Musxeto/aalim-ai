  "transcript": "T from UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh Alhamdulillah I've repented from collaborating upon sins with other Muslims whilst I was a Muslim who I know well personally by either being straight up and telling them what we did was wrong and they should repent too or giving them indirect ni'siha stating such and such thing is a sin so they can get the hint in case they're uneasy characters. Sheikh what about Muslims who I collaborated upon sin with from a few years ago who I don't know that well but I can get their contact number by trying asking other people so I can reach out to them over time they may have repented already and changed over time because I don't know them that well so should I try to get their number from other people and say hey we collaborated upon sin are you still doing that sin or just try to work out if they are so I can give them the ni'siha so that wherever I collaborated with them upon sin I can do my due diligence or is this overthinking going over the top because those people you're close with you can have that relationship and know if they're still committing a sin that you've collaborated them collaborated upon with them no you should not call them you should not check on them just move on with your life and leave people alone just focus on yourself and those who are in direct contact with you and fix what needs to be fixed but don't open old files and get in touch with people who you don't have any touch or contact with anymore"
