  "title": "Haram to sell food in daytime of Ramadan but can we buy food if we exempted from fasting",
  "transcript": "foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so basically the ruling on selling food during the daytime of Ramadan to others this is an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is that it's not permissible for a Muslim to sell food during the daytime of Ramadan to be consumed whether to Muslims or non-muslims because they're obliged too fast as the most authentic opinion of Scholars they are addressed the non-muslims they are addressed to fast to pray to give zakat with all Sharia related issues they are addressed by it and if they don't do it they're going to be punished on the day of judgment in addition to the punishment for their disbelief and therefore as Muslims as a restaurant owner I cannot sell food to such people who will consume it but I can sell food to a woman who's menstruating a sick person to a child because they're not obliged to fast these are Exempted from fasting so serving them food is permissible now having said that this has nothing to do with a grocery shop or a a vegetables shop that cell food but not for immediate consumption this needs to be prepared so can I do shopping in afternoon and buy such food there's no problem and likewise when the restaurant sells you a food I come at four o'clock and I buy cooked meals that I would consume after Sunset which is in two to three hours later there's nothing wrong in that the thing the wrong thing is to serve such food to those who are going to eat it so if someone comes and buys from me a meal that I cooked even if it's 12 o'clock in the after in the noon at noon there's no problem if I don't know whether he's going to eat it or not if he's going to take it to heat it up and warm it up later on and eat it after uh the sunset there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best [Music] oh my God and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
