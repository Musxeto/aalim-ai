  "transcript": "in alhamdulillah for [Music] [Music] for may Allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet sallallah alai said the five prayers and the from one week to the other and Ramadan to the following Ramadan are an experation so long as you do not commit major sins in this beautiful authentic Hadith our Prophet divides sins into two types major and minor and this is mentioned in the Quran as well where Allah says if you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden we will remove from you your lesser sins and admit you to a noble entrance and that is into jenah may Allah make me and you of the people of Jenna and a major sin is defined as follows what is a major sin it is every sin that Allah threatened Those who commit it with torment or fire or a prescrib punishment in dun or by cursing that individual and exit him out of Allah's mercy and so many of the Muslims believe that these major sins are seven I Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father was asked are the major sins seven he said they are closer to be 70 than seven and Allah knew that we are weak and vulnerable so he guided us and directed us to what erases and forgives such sins so Allah ordered us to repent and to seek his forgiveness as Allah says in the Quran and seek your lord 's forgiveness and turn to him in Repentance he will grant you a good provision for an appointed term but what is the difference between and what's the difference between seeking forgiveness and repentance is Dua is asking Allah to forgive your sins and to remove any consequences in this life or in the Hereafter so it's Dua you ask Allah to forgive you while repentance is to quit the sin and to intend not to do it and to have deep remorse in your heart that you have committed such a sin at the sight of Allah and it has to be known to all of us as humans Allah created us prone to fall into sin and to make errors and to forget and because Allah his name is because these beautiful names of Allah relating to the one who guides to repentance and accept it the one who forgives the the the sins and the one who is most merciful because all of that Allah opened for us a door where we can enter from and seek his forgiveness first of all minor sins they are sins but when we avoid major sins Allah with his kindness and mercy erases these minor sins and when we do good deeds Allah erases minor sins and the proof for that this Hadith we have prayer to prayer J to J Ramadan to Ramadan to all of these erase and forgive and expediate our minor sins and the most important of all of these Deeds is because this is what Allah Asel mainly erases minor sins with the prophet saysat to his companions shall I tell you some something by means of which Allah erases sins and raises people in status the companion said yes so prophet of Allah tell us inform us so the prophet saidat doing wo properly and this woodo is to be done at times of hardship when it's too hot and the the water is too warm you do it properly when when it's too cold and freezing yet you do the woodo properly this will erase your sins the prophet said Alat doing Wu properly at times when it is difficult to do so number two taking many steps to the Masjid the more you walk to the Masjid the more sins are erased and the more of your status is raised and waiting for prayer after prayer that is constant Readiness so the prophet also told us whoever makes a perfect woo and then prays only two raas only but he does not speak to himself about worldly matters he does not have Whispers he does not stray away from Salat he concentrates fully only for these two Allah will forgive his sins now Allah knows that we are weak that we will make sins every single day because this is how we were created yet Allah told us what erases these sins Allah encouraged us to repent he's calling us come and repent regardless of your sin never ever think of a sin that it is too great for Allah's mercy no matter what heest sin you had committed Allah forgives it if you come and seek his forgiveness and repent to him no matter what sin even if you you dug ditches in the ground filled it with fire and threw the Muslims and the Believers in it to torture them even if you do such a heinous Massacre and you repent Allah forgives you Allah says in the Quran those who persecute the believing men and women torture them by burning them alive and then do not repent meaning if they were to repent Allah would accept them and then do not repent will certainly suffer the punishment of hell and the torment of burning not only that Allah has given repentance and forgiveness for Those who commit the most heinous sins in Islam those who associate others with Allah shik Those Who Kill innocent people Those who commit Zena and fornicate and who shall ever do this will be severely tormented and humilated on the day of judgment and this is for eternity but then Allah says except for those who repent believe and do righteous work for them Allah will replace their evil Deeds with good deeds and ever is Allah forgiving and merciful so anyone who commits such high heinous Sins Not only Allah will forgive him Allah will replace his sins with good deeds Subhan Allah how is this possible some Scholars say Allah will change his shik intoed he's killing innocent people into Safety and Security his fornication into Chastity and righteousness other Scholars said no he committed 1 million sins Allah will forgive him and repent to him if he comes in Repentance and change it into one million good deeds and hassat and this is Allah's forgiveness and this is Allah's kindness and mercy if you have this sincere repentance and offer Good Deeds this is light upon light I say what you hear and I seek Allah's forgiveness for me and for you so ask him for forgiveness alhamdulillah says those who are sinful Allah Asel placed for them in this dun three huge Rivers where they can erase and expiate their sins River number one sincere repentance when you sincerely repent Allah forgives your sins River number two Good Deeds that would overwhelm your sins so you commit one sin commit another good deed Allah will multiply one to 10 and 10 to 700 it would overwhelm your sin and Allah would forgive it the Third River is the river of calamities tests and hardship and this River you have nothing to do with it you're sitting in your home a Calamity and a hardship befalls upon on you stress depression confusion an accident poverty illness something you have nothing to do with it Allah when you're patient erases your sins accordingly what happens if I were to die and my sins are still there these three huge Rivers were not sufficient says in this case there is one last River in Hellfire that you have to be admitted to be cleansed and washed off your sins before being admitted to jenah may Allah protect us and keep us away from such Rivers now the river of hardship and calamities no one can be saved from it not even The Messengers and the prophets of Allah Asel on the contrary the more tests you get the more closer you Allah you are to Allah the prophet said Allah when he loves people what does he do he tests them with calamities with hardship this purifies them and raises their status and whenever you go through such hardship remember your beloved prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam he was the most tested of Allah's creation you look at what the idol worshippers did to him they accused him of sorcery of being insane of being a liar of being a poet of being a soothsayer they even slandered him and accused his beloved pure innocent wife of adultery they attacked him physically they abused him verbally and they did any they could do to harm him and he is Allah's most beloved human being so what about you and me indeed when we tested we are not even close to the prophet Muhammad Alat so whenever you get such hardship whenever you get get calamities remember that these are from our own sins and Allah is erasing them by such hardship and Calamity the prophet saysat wasam no stress or exhaustion befalls upon a Muslim nor worry or distress even a thorn which Pricks him but Allah will expiate for his sins because of that so poverty illness are all part of Allah's great hardship and calamities that Muslims have no other way out but to be patient and tolerant and content and the worst of all hardship and calamity ities are those that afflict us in our religion if we fall sick tomorrow we will become better if we fall poor tomorrow we will become rich but if we lose our religion if we are tested with calamities in our own Chastity in our own religious practice if we become addicted to pornography or to lying or to cheating or dealing in rib or financing in or houses and mortgages in Haram this is a Calamity and hardship in our religion how can we ever recover from this how many righteous practicing women were tested with a hardship and a Calamity when their her father got her married to a corrupt husband a sinful husband who orders her to take the hijab and to free mix and to to do Haram things in her house how many righteous practicing young men who are being harassed and abused by their own relatives and friends just because they grew a beard and started to practice Islam and follow the Sunnah therefore our religion is a beautiful religion whenever you fall weak whenever you fall into sin whenever you disobey Allah the Almighty immediately after a sin do good deeds give charity go and be dutiful to your parents connect to your next of kin and above all pray on time in the Masjid as Allah ordered you because all of this will help you get rid of these sins Allah says an establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night indeed Good Deeds do away with misdeeds so if the prayer is being called for theama is being called and the Muslims are praying on time in the Masjid and you're not with them how do you want Allah to forgive your sins if you're not complying with this little task that Allah is ordering you to do and you prefer to watch a football match or a movie or to sit with the children and skip the Salat with the congregation how do you expect Allah to forgive your sins it is sufficient for us Muslims in the midst of this ocean this ocean of sins and tribulations and fitan it is sufficient for us to sincerely have our Deeds for Allah and follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat wasam if we do this Allah will forgive our sins and after all of this there is always the huge immense mercy of Allah it is he who completes what's missing it is he who accept repentance and forgives sins and opens the gates of repentance to those coming back to their lord those anxious and eager to enter into his Mercy so never ever despair of Allah's mercy and never ever be heedless from repenting and asking Allah for forgiveness and offering Good Deeds Allah a [Music] allb [Music] [Music] allahar [Music]
