  "transcript": "sister shaheen from the uk um my first question is sheikh um we had lots of pressure from family to buy a house in uk you know and obviously without mortgage buying a house is very very difficult here but we alhamdulillah we saved some money and uh um we inshallah we will have enough money to buy the house but the problem is now when you when you see the situation like jaman what happened what was happening in palestine and all that sometime i just feel should i should we have that saved money to buy the house or should we help other muslim brothers and sister the world with that money and and i know my husband wouldn't allow to give all the money but obviously this may be some little money jahin's questions from the uk are very very um legit her first question is that we are entitled to buy a house and you know how rent is way up the roof family is pressuring us in the uk all migrants all settlers first priority is to purchase a real estate a property so that it would be there for them and for their children and that's a good investment that's a realistic thing it's one of the basic needs in life however when we come and look at the plight of muslims worldwide whether in yemen syria in libya in africa in burma the refugees or the hindu or the chinese uh yogas and and and uh oppressed worldwide we come to evaluate would it be fair us owning such a property while our brothers and sisters are suffering well if we look into your cupboards would it be fair to say that you only need one dress or two at most and the rest of the 15 or 20 pieces of clothes also should be given away and if you look at your cars or even one car alhamdulillah there's the tube in the uk there's a public transports there are many ways of commuting that would save a lot of money and instead of eating three meals one meal a day would do and why so extravagant few pieces of dates and a glass of milk would give you energy for the rest of the week with this logic we will not be able to survive and not not only by logic we understand things we go back to the way of the prophet was you tell me did the prophet al-islam forbade did the prophet sasa forbid his companions from acquisitions from buying things from owning things no when uthman came to him to buy the well of rumah and he poured the money gold in his lap or when he wanted financing for the army going to tabuk jesus and he did the same did the prophet hassan reprimand him said fear allah why do you have so much money when all the muslims are starving or this or that did the prophet alice islam prohibit his companions from celebrating eid at the time where the muslims were oppressed in mecca and were not allowed to come and migrate to medina no when the muslims died in the battle of motta when they were fighting the byzantians on the eighth year of hijrah when the people of birmingham were martyred did the prophet prevent them from celebrating or from wearing a dormant or putting perfume you have to balance things our hearts bleed to our muslim brothers and we do whatever we can giving them zakat giving them moral support spreading the word about their suffering and about their cause but that does not mean we should restrict ourselves from living normally and buying a property is from the basic needs of any muslim family and there's nothing wrong in doing that so don't let shaytan mess up with your head you"
