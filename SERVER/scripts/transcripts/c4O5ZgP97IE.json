  "transcript": "his second question is about the cat so if I have I live in Saudi Arabia my home country is India and there are people in need of the cat of food in Syria in Yemen in Libya in Somalia in Afghanistan in elsewhere so many impoverished people in Kashmir I know that they need a lot so can i relocate my zakat it's an issue of dispute some scholars say that the cat must be given must be paid in the country you live in and the most authentic opinion is that whenever there is a need this is it is permissible for you to dispatch your wealth because the hadith of Mahadev in Java where the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam told him to tell the people of Yemen when he went to give them Dawa that informed them that Allah has taken portion of the wealth of the rich to be returned to their poor now their poor some scholars understood that it is the locals those who are poor in that country itself others said no it means that from the rich of the Muslims to the poor of the Muslims and this is wider understanding and Allah knows best"
