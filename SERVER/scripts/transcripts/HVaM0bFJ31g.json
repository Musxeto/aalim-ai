  "title": "Spitting all day in Ramadan (ocd & wiswas) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "this is not my biggest problem my biggest problem is with those who have ocd who overthink i know people who call me and they say they keep on spitting their saliva it's in their mouth they keep on spitting all day long and you can imagine how dry their mouths are and how bad this is for them uh physically and medically but this is nothing wrong in swallowing your own saliva it's inside of your body when you make wudu and you spit what's in your mouth wooden bay there a little residue of the water what are you gonna do bring a vacuum cleaner put it in your mouth to suck everything in it this is illogical so such overthinking and exaggeration is ways of shaytan to mess up with your head so there's nothing wrong and it does not impact your fasting inshallah you"
