  "title": "How to interact with the Ayat of Quran? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ibn Muhammad from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh, could you clarify how we can interact with the ayat of the Quran while reciting and could you give us a demonstration on how? Akhi, this is not a small topic to be addressed. The beauty of the ayat of the Quran is that it can be benefited from a vast wide different angles. From the aspects of Aqidah, from the aspects of Fiqh, from the aspects of reminding you with Allah, softening your hearts etc. So many miracles. So you can't just come and put a question like this and expect an answer. The more you understand the Tafseer and contemplate upon these verses being spoken by Allah and addressed to you, the more interaction you would have. But if you listen to them without contemplating or pondering or understanding, most likely you would not benefit as much. So you have to learn the Tafseer and try your level best to understand the meanings of it, preferably to prepare before attending the Salat or the Taraweeh or doing your usual Dhikr or Wird and reading the Tafseer of it so that you can have a better understanding and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
