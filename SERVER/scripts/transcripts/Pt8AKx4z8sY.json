  "title": "What is WRONG with this Ummah  people leave the masjid w/out making athkaar & put hands on chest???",
  "transcript": "where is right on the door Yes Yes mine are two questions inallah first after the five prayers there these Subhan alhamd after every five prayers some people just walk away after Salam you see somebody going off the musk when you ask him he tells you that that is the first question than my second question is of uh putting the hands on the stomach some people you see them on on top of the chest yeah trying to be to be more Pious why do you classify it as trying to be more Pious how do you know maybe they're protecting their heart from running away okay if it if this is judgmental now you're judging them okay I'm sorry because they will say you put your hands on your stomach because you have stomach ache okay so both ways are acceptable alhamdulillah okay as for the first question what was itar thear the Sunnah is that when you read your Salat you say your seated you concluded the Salah but you are still at prayer as long as you're sitting in your prayer position Allah will reward you is it mandatory no so many companions at the time of the Prophet even in the Hadith of Abu you know the the Hadith of the two long arms when the prophet prayed two in he forgot he prayed two ra then went to the mimber crossed his fingers and did like this and he was angry something was bothering him the of says those who are usually at the end immediately left we have a discount prayer is to and they left and the prophet did not comment negatively the companies did not comment negatively which means it is permissible so if someone one leaves immediately after the prayer there is no problem in that he's saying Hisar on the way to the car or to the house and he's reading ayat he's doing everything you're doing the only thing missing is that you are in salot and he's not and again this is a personal preference you do not force me to be like you I have things to do no no no stay do do your leave me alone no no do your I have my mother is sick I have to attend her I have to take my child to the hospital I have to go to the toilet no do your AAR now this is too much control now as for where to place your hand the right over the left whether on your stomach below the navl above the navl on the chest it's an issue of dispute among Scholars those who follow a maab must not be blind following it to the extent that anyone who does anything else is wrong how do you know that your maab is right I've seen my father and my grandfather and my great great grandfather do it so mashallah and what about the 800 billion Muslims who don't do it they're all wrong they also saw their fathers and great great great great great fathers do it so issues of Islam is not resolved by power or by majority or by how big your bicep is it's resolved through you have to refer it back to the Quran and to the Sunnah now when we come to this issue we find that it all revolves around the authentication of the Hadith the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with him where he said that I saw the prophet Alat wasam placing his right hand over the left hand on the chest some people say this is Hadith authentic like a albani others say that this is not authentic and it said of dispute I tell you do what you feel you are fine with so I pray with Brothers praying next to me like this some of them even put their hands on their private part you're not a goalie there is no free kick you're praying put it up a little bit so should I be concerned no this is his preference some of the brothers from morania or Maliki followers they put it on the side it's your hands I don't care so when people put it this way this is wrong some people put it next to their not necks this is wrong I'm not going to hey put your hand down don't pretend you're Pious no no no no I'm not going to do this your Pious this is between you and Allah I'm not going to judge you but I care about my own prayer whatever you like you pray now I will open another Frontier in people move their index finger like this they're like thriving and going right it's like indicator and some of the brothers move too flasher I have sheim with me in the car Ahmed always does this huh others say no once others say twice other do circling like this other put their hands like this and Su and sitting they don't sit normal they sit like this what is this so what's the ruling I don't care about them you do whatever you want you come to me I'll show you the Sunnah you follow follow it good for you you don't follow it I'm happy for you but don't make an issue out of it don't allow Shan to create hatred oh no no this is Extreme he's putting his hand on the chest and I say no this guy is too lenient he's a goalie he's putting his hand for a free kick and each one of us blame the others and we play the blaming game and the labeling game this is what shatan wants in the when the is done the prophet used to say some of the brothers say there is nothing of and he used to say don't leave gaps for Shan when we start to look at the brother's prayer next to me I'm better or try to you know play hide and seek I want to put my foot on his foot the brother is going I'm catching you and the brother on the right is and I'm doing like karate split what are you doing he said I'm trying to foot to foot and shoulder to shoulder your shoulder is one meter away the shoulders are the most important to align by it if the brother is following the Sunnah and you feel his heart is like your heart stick your foot to him but if you see that whenever you come near he goes see leave him alone no I have to teach him the Sunnah no you don't have to teach him anything because he will teach you MMA after the [Applause] don't allow shatan to corrupt our Salat to corrupt our hearts let our hearts be loving and caring and full of Mercy to all of our brothers and sisters and Allah Knows Best"
