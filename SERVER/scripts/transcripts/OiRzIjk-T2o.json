  "transcript": "and hypocrisy is divided into two types hypocrisy that is major Cooper which is known as related to a leader to your belief and this is to show people that you are a Muslim but you actually are not you hide this belief you hate Islam you hate the Muslims you love other religions and you respect other religions more than you respect this not only that you look down at Islam at Sharia you considered it barbaric you don't love the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam why did the Prophet sat down on the ground and ate why didn't he use a chair stuff follow you here some atheists you hear some hypocrites say such things now this is major coup for allah azza wajal says in the quran warning us from those who are hypocrites and if you look at the quran it is filled with evidences with description of the hypocrites describing to us their characteristics why it's not vague it's crystal clear you will know them by the tone of their voices you can say that they do not mention Allah will not remember Allah they're lazy when they go to forms of worship so many did characteristics of the hypocrite why because they are far greater in danger than the enemies of Islam of among the different religions so if we have an army who's about to attack us the hypocrites are more dangerous sure the enemy has air force they have Marines they have tanks they have RPGs they have guns yes but you know them and you can fight them and you can defend your country yourself and your religion with someone standing next to you pretending to be a Muslim you never know when he'll stab you in the back and this is the most or the biggest problem Allah says in the Quran warning us again we have to refer to the Quran read the Quran Allah says and of the people are some who say we believe in Allah and the last day but they are not believers this is the testimony of Allah they think to deceive Allah and those who believe but they deceive not except themselves and perceive it not they don't know it and the hypocrites when they are hypocrites they're not making a small sin that you can just brush it off your shoulder and come us kiss and make up no harm done no it's problematic it is something that takes you out of the religion of Islam Allah says in the Quran indeed the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire and never will you find for them a helper now houston we have a problem whenever we speak about hypocrisy do you ever for an instance small tiny bit consider yourself maybe I am a hypocrite I will not make a survey because if I say okay hope those who do please raise your hands everybody will raise his hand or face being a hypocrite but the truer thing is that we don't when we speak about Hippocrates the first thing that comes to mind rulers politicians wealthy people people of the media actors and actresses sinners night clubbers drunkards everybody else except the one from the Arabian Peninsula everyone except me and this is a prep a problem the Companions did not deal with hypocrisy like this they were truly afraid and this fear shoots you straight to Jannah but if you don't have this fear you have a problem so what are types how much what are the types of this major hypocrisy that we can relate to one corruption or on earth any type of corruption on earth makes you a hypocrite either a full-fledged or any close but no cigars so such as so any type of wanting to spread sins an advocator an endorser of sins would be having this characteristic of hypocrite hypocrite hypocrisy in the sense that we know that listening to music is haram I play music so what the heck no problem it's sinful but if you spread it you endorse it you know it's Haram and you're calling people to do it and defending it you're in great danger and likewise if you open a nightclub if you open an interest-based Bank and you spread her arm transactions among the Muslims involving them in consuming RIBA Allah says and when it is said to them that is the hypocrites do not cause corruption on the earth they say we are not but reformers we're not spreading corruption we are reformers unquestionably it is they who are the corrupters but they perceive it not number two among the science of people being hypocrite is that they deceive the believers and the disbelievers and this is the story of the vast majority of Muslims who take sides with the disbelievers against the believers not because there's a dispute on land or on wealth or on power but because they have devotion and allegiance to the kuffar against the Muslim so it's religiously based and this kind is found profoundly in the Muslim countries in the Muslim world from those who were brought up and educated by the disbelievers in every country you will find moles being there waiting for the right moment maybe after twenty years thirty years when they strike so you find in most countries the Constitution is not Islam it's not the Koran who did this mohammed abdullah ahmed ali muslim names but where were they educated don't ask so allah says and when they meet those who believe they say we believe so when they meet the believers they claim to be believers as well and when they are alone with their evil ones they say indeed we are with you we were mocking them if you open the newspaper or watch news channels you see this clearly all over the Muslim world they enjoin evil and forbid my oath and righteous and virtue Allah says the hypocrites men and women are from one another they enjoin on the people al-munkar and forbid people from al-munkar hands from spending in the way of law part of their characteristics is that they always swear by Allah lying and you can see this in their press conferences he knows what's in my heart yes you hypocrites ever so and so Allah does but you are a hypocrite and this is why when someone swears a lot when he speaks this is condemned in the Quran don't use Allah's name in vain so that people would believe you your actions should ensure that but when you say Allah he will look there's something wrong you probably are lying Allah says they have taken their oaths as a cover so that they avert it people from the way of Allah part of the characteristics of hypocrites is showing off boasting about their good deeds and we have to make a distinction in an hour it is time for so if I'm walking out and I'm going to the Masjid and someone says where are you going I have something to do masha'Allah Malak Allah what are you doing is it I'm hiding my good deeds wrong why is it wrong this is followed followed you do not hide you announce where are you going I'm going to the salat in the Masjid you have to announce this in Ramadan would you go with me - I'm tired I'm fasting we're all fasting but when it comes to voluntary deeds this is what you should hide and not disclose only if needed with a legitimate reason I go to the office and a friend comes and sits I'm busy working typing printing having called businesses working hours and he sits there for half an hour yawning I feel tired I haven't slept I don't ask him why didn't you sleep it's none of my business I don't have time so he keeps on doing these things and after half an hour when he gives up that I don't ask him he said oh ma I'm tired because last night I sprayed to night two hours night prayer what are you doing are you crazy this is showing off and this is how and this is part of hypocrisy your deeds should be for the sake of Allah imam malik at Nana's in medina one of the four great Imams he used to spend his time do you think I have side mirrors I can't see he used to open in Ramadan and reach and whenever someone comes in he hides it with his garment why so that people would not see that he spends a lot of time reading the Quran unlike us when Ramadan comes first five days we meet and sms everybody i finished half of the quran how much did you finish we see which is better than you and people lie I lie you're forcing me to lie and this is Shah throwing off and this is part of what hypocrisy and also part of the signs of hypocrisy is to be lazy in forming in performing forms of worship what yes hypocrites by the way used to travel for jihad they used to accompany the Prophet in Jihad now we don't even go to five minutes over times because we don't want to the hypocrites used to travel the hypocrites used to pray in the masjid but when they go to pray they are a little bit lazy so instead of going in the fourth okay now you compare Apple Apple do you go to jihad do you go to the Masjid being enthusiastic in the first row do you remember a lot they used to give Shaitaan energy this is scary for us when we give terror when you give lectures exempted tax fee I myself know they used to eat that way as well but their articulation is beautiful what they say is very nice and articulate and fluent yet what's in their heart you can detect in what they say so this is problematic because now it could be any one of us and no one is able to detect this except you you have to look deep inside am i fully devoted to islam to worshipping allah erosion on purifying my Aki now they say that time is almost over but we haven't gone to part two of hypocrisy which is the practical part because there is a part that takes you out of the fold of Islam which you had mentioned and there's a part that is practical forms of hypocrisy which which deals with the do's and don'ts and this is the type that Romo asked the Prophet Hosea may Allah be pleased with them about Rama was not in doubt that he's a kafir he was doubtful that maybe he might lie he might break a promise he's interested with and all of these are characteristics of hypocrisy to follow but of unity of actions actions he says [Music] [Music] yes because he rejected something from Islam sometimes the sisters fall into this ok the brothers so they would say discrimination the brothers do this all the time the brothers are very few but the sisters are folk this is why we've learned since we were young to say yes otherwise so obedient man this is complain it's not why there's a man marry for I don't like this I don't want and they object verbally this takes you a little bit out of the folder Islam if not 100% this is Allah's religion now you don't want your husband to get married this is legit you do not object upon the ruling of Allah you do not object that hijab is mandatory even when it's hot and humid in Kuala Lumpur some of the sisters say in summer and let me see how you do I'm sweating like a pig it's air-conditioned I know how sisters feel but this is their test from a my associate so what takes you out of hypocrisy is that you give your heart the leadership the leadership of your heart and let to allah azza wajal use irani he come - r11 a nominal more 13 in Hawaii you Darla collaterally sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina"
