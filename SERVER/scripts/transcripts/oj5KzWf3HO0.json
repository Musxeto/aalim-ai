  "title": "Does Translating The Khutbah Break the Sequence & is it Valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "yunas from Germany so an Islam QA said that during J if there is a um if there is a translation by list between the between the two someone makes it toas and while he sits listen stands up and gives a long translation Islam said this is invalid because it's it breaks okay so it um it breaks sequence now if the translation is between and second is it valid in your opinion who in his right mind would do such a thing I don't know any Masjid that would interrupt the sequence of the by inserting such translations in between this is not valid it it should be either they make a different separate sermon before the aan or after the prayer is over someone stands and translates for those who want to listen those who don't they can leave but to interrupt theba like this this is an innovation and it's not permissible you're adding something to theba because theba and the Salat as per the prophet is to have two with sitting in between briefly and then immediately the Salat afterwards and I've said this so many times those who insist on making their in Germany or in America or in places that people don't speak Arabic those who insist on making it in Arabic they are losing the essence of the because they're the only one who understands it maybe two or three in the audience and the rest don't know what they're talking about so instead they should make it in the language of the country they are in and Allah Knows Best"
