  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK I have a question\num regarding you know having more children so a couple has three children already uh\nis it allowed for them to decide to not have a fourth one because they want to focus on\nstudying Islamic knowledge for example uh memorizing Quran Hadith study the Arabic language\nin depth and at the same time focus on the upbringing of the of their children is this\na valid reason to not have any more children this is an issue of dispute among Scholars\nsome say that as long as you have an adequate number and they never give the number that\nis adequate of children and both the couple agree that this is maybe enough for now that\nthis is permissible so in your case having three or four children and wanting to slow\nthings a bit maybe five years ten years Allah knows what happens in the future then both\nof the couple are fine with this they say some Scholars say that this is okay other\nScholars say the general Trend and the hadiths of theProphet (Peace and Blessings Upon Him)\nis to go ahead and produce and to have as many children as you want because the Prophet\n(Peace and Blessings Upon Him) is going to boast the other uh Messengers with the number\nof his followers and he recommended that we marry a woman that's fertile and is capable\nof giving a lot of children because he said that he's going to boast other nations with\nour numbers so this is an instruction and a recommendation that we have to keep on having\nchildren indefinitely until the assembly line doesn't work anymore I believe that it is\npermissible to limit the number of children if the number is adequate like three or four\nor more that's okay but to have one child and then stop and say I don't want to have\nchildren anymore or two and have don't want to have any children anymore this is not recommended\nand some would argue and say that this is not permissible because this defies the encouragement\nof the prophet and there isn't any fixed ruling that's saying Halal Haram Etc we know that\nthe prophet according to Hadith of Jaber uh may Allah be pleased with him and with his\nfather that they used to not have full intercourse with their spouses in order not to have children\nof course this is done with the approval of the wife and the prophet witnessed that and\ndid not blame them or said no you should not refrain from doing that you should not do\nthis because this would not make your wife pregnant you have to do the whole thing properly\nhe did not comment on it negatively or saying that you're doing something wrong which means\nthat this is permissible but again it's not the best thing to do and Allah Knows Best\nforeign [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session\nwith me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you\ncan afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this\nis for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're\npoor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me\nand let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will\nuh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
