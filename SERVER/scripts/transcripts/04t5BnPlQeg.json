  "transcript": "Mohsen from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is what does one can learn good conduct and character from just by watching the lectures? I want to observe them and learn from them if this is something you would recommend. Barak Allahu Fikum, I like to encourage you. So I did not get the question of Mohsen but maybe he said that, I don't know, who are the scholars of contemporary times that we can watch and learn from their character and their etiquettes if they are present? I think this was his question and I would highly recommend to watch Sheikh Ibn Baz, Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on them because they had one of the best characters around and the way they behaved with people who wronged them and were not polite was very discreet and good. May Allah have mercy on them."
