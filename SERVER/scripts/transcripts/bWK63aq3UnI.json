  "transcript": "Muhammad from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. And bless you as well. Sheikh my father has passed away a few weeks ago. May Allah have mercy on him. Ameen. So and the thing is that I was a young kid I mean it's been a long time since he passed away but the thing is that I was not able to do anything for him since I was the youngest child in the family. Now that he has passed away can I have a routine like can I pray for him every morning and evening not because I found find it in the hadith or anything like that just as a part of like doing a habit. Can I pray for him? What do you mean by pray? Make dua? Yeah make dua for him like in every sujood or maybe in morning after morning adhkar or evening adhkar. Okay first of all the Prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam when a man dies all of his deeds are cut off except for three things. The first a right one of them is a righteous offspring that makes dua for him. So definitely making dua for your father is one of the ways of repaying him for what he had done and it's a good deed that Allah accepts. However fixing a specific time related to such as morning adhkar or after fajr and after maghrib would make it an innovation. Doing it every sujood is totally permissible because the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam directed us to ask Allah whatever we want in sujood. So you can ask Allah for forgiveness for your father in every sajdah of every prayer to expand his grave to fill it up with light and fragrances from Jannah. All of this is permissible without any problem."
