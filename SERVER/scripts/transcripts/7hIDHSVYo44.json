  "transcript": "from the uk he brought his brother a book many of the brothers and sisters i don't know people don't have any beneficial thing to do some of them ask sheikh what do you drink in uh ask zad in the cup he's not of your business what do you want to know what i drink i drink green tea and after the break this is arabic coffee satisfied so i don't know why people waste their time asking silly questions but you have to sometimes address these questions unfortunately so taimur says i brought a book with sunnas duas etc to my younger brother and my younger brother is reading from it and implementing it would i get reward this goes without saying every single thing that he reads from the book and implements you are automatically accredited with that though you are home on your bed asleep you don't know what your brother is doing why do you think we duat are so rewarded by allah insha allah because we do what we do we post that on youtube on twitter on facebook on whatever in on instagram or whatever and we don't pay attention to it yet people in the thousands or the hundred thousands benefit from it and even when we are lying on in our graves our meter is ticking with the grace of allah this is why the greatest of all people in reward is the prophet because everything we know everything we do everything we worship allah by came through him so he's the greatest of all and this is why we always say it is an innovation it's wrong it's bad for people to pray two raka's and say this is for the prophet or slaughter qurbani and they say this is for the prophet salam this is an innovation everything you do the prophet will be accredited with these good deeds"
