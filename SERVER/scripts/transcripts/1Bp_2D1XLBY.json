  "transcript": "Sheikh there was a time when I deeply questioned the purpose of prayer since Allah does not need us to pray. For decades I never found an answer that truly satisfied my mind. Then after listening you I decided to stop overthinking and just focus on praying and Alhamdulillah this helped me a lot. every rak'ah every single day feels monotonous. So shaitan tells me that to pause and pray only when you truly feel the urge. So I block the thought immediately but my subconscious mind Sheikh is still searching for an answer. So Sheikh how should I deal with this in a way that strengthens my faith rather than just suppressing the thoughts. JazakAllah. Wa Jazakum. Akhi this role of shaitan in this world his objective is only one to get you in hellfire with him on the day of judgment. How he does this there are so many ways this is not the time to explain them. But one of them is overthinking. So when you know that shaitan is throwing these curveballs in your head, when you know that shaitan is the one who is trying to look for unnecessary answers to questions that nobody asks about and you know that this would lead you to going astray, not focusing on your salat, losing the sweetness of ibadah. If you listen to shaitan you're the one who's to be blamed because shaitan is doing his job. You're the one who opened the door invited him in. There is nothing you could do but to block it, ignore it and move on and think positively of Allah and love Allah and love Islam. This would happen he would subside and go back and would rest for three four months until you are comfortable and you put your guard down, he will attack you again. And this cycle goes on and on and on for decades until your soul leaves your body. So never feel safe because shaitan is always lurking in the dark waiting to strike and to kill you if he can."
