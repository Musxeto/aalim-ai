  "title": "Is it considered segregated if men & women sit separately but can still SEE each other (Free Mixing)",
  "transcript": "so here from India I have a question I saw a video where Sheikh which said physical barrier is not necessary for a gathering to be classified as segregated as long as men and women are sitting separately so my question is can we attend a public dinner or a public in a restaurant or a public gathering where we are with our extended family members that is including non maharabs and we are seated separately and it's a big table and we are men are at one side females are at the site and there is no communication between the two I know looks exchange or anything WhatsApp and if this is permissible does the ruling change if women are wearing the proper hijab or if they are not wearing the proper hijab um now see when people try to water down since this is what leads to free mixing so in the beginning people were segregated men sat with men exchange food and talk and Gatherings without any problem and women did the same now why have we ended up in a situation where I have my wife and you get your wife and daughters and we go out for a picnic or for a gathering or we sit together and we eat and mix why do we have the concept of joint family where brothers and sisters-in-law sit together and communicate and look at one another and laugh and crack jokes and unfortunately in some such joint families catastrophes take place especially if the brother is overseas working and his wife is on that in that home lonely for five six months or a year or two or three and you put fire next to the fuel and say Ya Allah I hope it doesn't ignite and blow up it will blow up in your face inevitably unfortunately so what you're talking about is men in on one table women are one table they don't communicate with one another sounds okay people say there's segregated now you say okay what if they're not abiding by the proper hijab well if they're not looking at one another it's like sitting in a normal restaurant it seems okay so what is it a little bit close and I can hear them talk and I can engage in their conversations and their laughter and especially when women track jokes among one another and they laugh with a nice beautiful feminine feminist voice and the man also crack jokes and they laugh and they're masculine voices and there's something in the air what's what's what's cooking so it is how shaytan works do not follow the steps of shaytan he doesn't come all of a sudden this is how people water down since the best is what Sharia came with the best of men's draws in the Masjid are the first the worst of men Rose in the masjids are the last the worst of women's roles in the Masjid are the first because they're closer to the men and the best of women's roles in the Masjid are the last this is what Shariah came with and this is the best that we should abide by"
