  "title": "Is Yeast in foods large or small permissible to eat? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Najwa from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam I asked this question before and you answered with a link from Islam Q&A, but I didn't really understand. So my question is, is yeast in foods, whether there is a large amount or a little amount of yeast in the food permissible to eat? The link from Islam Q&A clearly stated the fatwa of Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen, which I don't understand how you cannot understand it. Yeast is not alcohol. It is put and used with dough, with bakeries, with food, and no matter how much you use, it will never ever intoxicate you. And Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen said, even if you consume yeast raw, if anyone would do that, that would not intoxicate you, so it's totally halal."
