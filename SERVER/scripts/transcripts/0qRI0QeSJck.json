  "title": "The importance of saying Bismillah assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem. This is a phrase that all Muslims begin every important thing in their lives with. Because when you say, in the name of Allah, what do you mean by in the name of Allah? It means that if I'm gonna drink, I say, Bismillah, I drink. But I don't say this. I just say, Bismillah. If I'm gonna write, I say, Bismillah, and I write. Meaning, in the name of Allah, I write. In the name of Allah, I ride my car. In the name of Allah, I wear my clothes. So this is why I say, Bismillah. There's something missing. You fill it in according to what you're gonna do. Imam Muhammad says, No, may Allah have mercy on you. So now he's addressing you. That we are obligated to learn four matters. First, four things you have to know. Knowledge, which means awareness of Allah, awareness of his Prophet, and awareness of the religion of Islam based on evidences. So it's not Simon Says. It is, Islam is not a religion that is based on hearsay. It's based on evidences. This is the beauty of Islam. If I were a Catholic priest or a Pope, I say, you have to believe my son. Khalas. I gave you the evidence. In Islam, no. Allah says, one, two, three, four, in the Quran. The Prophet says, one, two, three, four, in the Sunnah. Now you're related. You don't have to believe what I say because Simon Says. So you need to base your belief on evidences. Second, acting on this. On what? Quick, quick. Knowledge. Acting on knowledge. Because if you know, but you don't act, you are a hypocrite. If you know, but you don't act, you'll be a question on a day of judgment. You know the ruling. Why didn't you implement it? Because this. No, no, no. You have to know, then you have to act. Third, calling to it. How do you call to it? Dawa. So I believe that sports is good for you. So whenever we sit together, Akhi, you have to hit the gym. You have to hit the treadmill. You have to do some weights. I believe. I'm selling you. If I believe in cars, the moment we sit, oh, did you see the latest Ferrari or the Porsche 928s? So whatever you believe in, you always share it. So you believe in Islam, you always share it. That's why a good Muslim, no matter where he is, I'm sitting with a kafir. I'll try to drop, not a bomb. I'll try to drop a word of advice. Sometimes I, I'm in India. This happened once. And we had a driver, me and my friend, and the driver's name, by the way, is Shaitan. Wallahi, he's Hindu. And we wanted to speak together. And then I said, stop. And I said to the driver, excuse me, can we speak in Arabic? And the guy said, oh, no problem. I said, no, there is problem. There is problem. The problem is that the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam prohibited us from speaking in private in the presence of a third. So in my religion, it's haram. And he said, oh, that's interesting. No, no, I have no problem. Thank you. You can speak. Is this dawah? I dropped something that would resonate in his head. You never know, maybe six, seven years down the line, the guy says, I love this religion because I put the seed and this is what you should do. Other than sitting with someone and say, hey, did you see the Super Bowl? Man, it was great, man. Did you see Rihanna? Oh, she sang this and that. Hey, what are you doing? You're a Muslim. You should not share this. I go sometimes to countries and the brother's picking me up for pictures. Wallahi, this happened in London once. The guy's beard is this long. And he was driving, he said, oh, Sheikh, how did you chill? And we passed by a poster of a movie. Wallahi, this movie is great. Sheikh, did you see Hangover 2? Excuse me. He said, no, the movie. Yes. Wow, man. I didn't see Hangover 1 to see Hangover 2. Yes, yes, Sheikh, of course, I know. Moved on. Is Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde? No, you have to call people to it. So knowledge, acting upon it, calling people to it. Number four, patience with the harm that befalls due to it. So if you know, you act and you call people, is your life going to be smooth? It's going to be a bumpy ride. And no one works in dawah has a smooth ride. Look at the Prophet, peace be upon him. How was his ride? It was the most difficult and challenging. But how was he inside? Content, happy, because he knew that this is what pleases Allah."
