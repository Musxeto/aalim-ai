  "title": "Can Muslims Offer Discounts for Non Muslim Holiday? Assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ilyas from Morocco Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So I work as a freelancer helping e-commerce brands grow their e-mail marketing revenue with e-mail campaigns So when Q4 comes, you know there is Christmas and Halloween and this part of the year is the most profitable for these brands Is it permissible to help them offer discounts on these occasions? I know it's haram to help promote these religious holidays But I was thinking of creating raw e-mails which do not contain any indication or any keyword or visuals for that holiday JazakAllah Khair It is not permissible to endorse or assist in non-Muslims feasts and holidays But if this is a selling season where people usually focus on selling their items And the people buy because they're used to buying cheap throughout the whole year Like the Black Friday, they call it Black Friday and the likes There's no problem for you to assist in spreading the discounts as long as it has nothing to do with endorsing their feasts and their celebrations So you're not saying Happy Christmas or Happy New Year or this and that You're just announcing that on this particular week or season we have a discount of 40% over selected items And there's nothing wrong in that Inshallah JazakAllah Khair"
