  "transcript": "Abdullah from India sh you must have heard about selling a soul to the devil to get rich and famous most celebrities are accused for selling the soul to the devil my question is is it really possible to sell a soul to the devil or to the Gin is there anything such as this thank you I haven't seen uh an auction yet or the um the souk or the market where you can go and sell your soul to the devil and even if you sell your soul to the devil as they say this doesn't guarantee you to be a celebrity or a rich man how many non-muslims are there in in in this world they say eight six that is the total population is eight two billions are Muslims six billions are non-muslims of these six billions how many of them had sold their soul to the devil a lot how many of them got rich and famous you cannot mention that it's very negligible so this is not a done deal the risk is only in Allah's hands and not in the devil's hands and Allah the Raz is the one who gives whenever he Wills so he may give those who have tried their best to go against him and to do mischief and to do evil things and sell their souls literally to the devil Allah may give them but Allah May deprive many of them and both will be entering hell for eternity on the day of judgment so it's up to Allah's will the devil has nothing to do with it the devil is just a caller he calls people he has no control over them it's the mistake of those who respond and answer him so Allah told us in many parts of the Quran whomever wants this Dunya wants Fame wants uh uh wealth Allah may give it to whomever he wishes but on the day of judgment he has nothing to Avail nothing to benefit from he'll be ending up in Hell Allah has given us this warning so there is no such thing as selling your soul to the devil there is going against Allah's commands and Shar and at the end of the day it's in Allah's hands whether to give this person some risk some sustenance in this world so that he would tempt others to follow and then it would be proven who is doing well and who is doing evil things look at what's happening around us in the world so much FNA so much evil so much Vice and lots of the Muslims are diving heads first in sucharat in such Haram why because because it's a test from Allah so that Allah would segregate between evil and good so now where where we stand we can identify those who are righteous those who are practicing those who are real Muslims from those who are hypocrites who are openly sinning who want Haram to spread all over the place it's obvious we can see that with the grace of Allah and may Allah protect us all for"
