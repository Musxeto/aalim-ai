  "transcript": "وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَنْ يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ وَمَنْ يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا dear brothers and sisters in islam we started to talk about tips on how to fix people's mistakes and correct their errors and how to deal with sinners and before that we said that there are a number of tips we should pay attention to that would give us a heads up before dealing with such scenarios and one of the tips that is important for us to understand that when you address a mistake and want to correct it it has to be based on authentic evidence and proof from the quran from the sunnah or from the teachings of real scholars of islam not just because you think of it think of it or because it goes well with your whims and desires and this is unfortunately prevailing among the muslims nowadays so many people come to you and why do you do this why do you do that especially the elders who think that they have knowledge that would enable them to correct what they think in their heads are mistakes i remember long long time ago i was praying in a masjid and i was pointing my index finger as per the sunnah as per the hadith of wael ibn hajjur may allah be pleased with him index finger i was shocked you know i'm in salat he's in salat he just did this after i finished prayer he addressed me and said this is playing around you should not do this now this is a 70 80 years old even out of courtesy if i were to tell him the sunnah being a young man in his early 20s he would not have accepted that so many people would also come to you i remember i was praying once in a masjid in syria and i was placing my hands on my chest while standing position after the salat was over a man came to me and said this is only to be done by women consider this only to be done by women does he have evidence or proof from the quran or the sunnah definitely not and most of those who talk nowadays don't back up what they say with evidences from the quran or from the sunnah it's only i don't think for yourself that's your problem keep it to yourself but you don't go to others and tell them you should do this or you shouldn't do that unless you have proof Muhammad Ibn Al-Munkadir said that Jabir Ibn Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father prayed once wearing only one izar that is the lower garment wrapped around the waist and it was tied at the back so that he would not expose his when going for ruku or sujood as they did not wear trousers underneath them at the time and his other clothes were on a cloths hook so he had other clothes in the room someone saw him and said to him are you praying in one garment so this individual is talking to one of the prophet's companions alayhi salatu wasalam correcting what he thought it was a mistake for praying in one garment yes we know that the sunnah is to pray in two garments but praying in one garment is permissible so Jabir may Allah be pleased with him replied and he said I only did it so that some foolish person like yourself would see me who among us had two garments at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu wasalam so Ibn Hajar may Allah be have mercy upon him says saying so that someone foolish like yourself refers to someone who's ignorant because this person spoke without knowledge Jabir is teaching his students he did this deliberately so that they would learn yes he acknowledged that praying in two garments is better than praying in one but praying in one is permissible so that he did this so that they would learn that it was permissible like herself could see me the reason was of his you know being a little bit strict and rude in his answer so that people would know that it is not something easy for any Tom Dick or Harry just to come and talk about scholars or students of knowledge let alone addressing them publicly about something you think that is wrong I remember I was recently in Canada stood up and said why do you have a bodyguard and this was a Q&A for Islamic purposes I just delivered a lecture so you ask me about my lecture and this guy made this objection correction of mistake he thought it was a mistake why do you have a bodyguard first of all yeah it's not my bodyguard I don't have bodyguards who am I it's the organizers that appointed such a person to accompany me not me and if you had a problem come and speak to me privately why addressing such an issue in public either you want to be looked at and addressed and to for people to say that oh mashaAllah this guy is is bold he's asking brave questions and this is not the Islamic way of tackling things and this is something that we as Muslims must incorporate in our techniques when we see a mistake whether to address it in such a fashion or this fashion or that because it's not one size that fits all it depends on many many factors the other point that we would like to bring your attention to is that when you correct mistakes you have to prioritize if there are mistakes that are so grave and serious they are worthy of being addressed addressed than trivial small mistakes though these are all mistakes these are all sins and errors that need to be addressed for example if there's an individual who doesn't pray who maybe goes to dargahs and graveyards and worship the grave the graves who is intoxicated and who has many many other sins such as dealing in riba, cheating, lying and he has long fingernails wouldn't it be audacious and a bit stupid to go and say to him akhi, fear Allah your fingernails are long and the prophet ordered us to clip them and he timed 40 days for us definitely this is ridiculous there are bigger fish to fry you have to address important things such as shirk he's a mushrik so what would it make any difference would it make any difference no no whether he has long nails or short nails it doesn't matter address what is most important and this is why we tell people in our communities when we say see women not wearing the hijab doing tabaruj when we see men not praying in the masjid or shaving their beards or cheating and lying and dealing with riba or doing heinous things or mistreating their wives and not taking care of their children we always say these are symptoms of the illness yes we have to address them when it is time and when it's appropriate but what is more important is to address the chronic illness that's in the heart what caused them to watch pornography what caused them to neglect salat on time or to free mix or to have illicit relationships this was caused by the void they have in their hearts when they don't know who they're worshipping when they have zero knowledge of Allah's beautiful names if you ask them can you list some of Allah's names they would fail miserably and they address they acknowledge Allah has 99 names whoever knows them implements them understand the meanings memorizes them he will enter jannah okay mashallah that's good of you how many names do you know the best of them the meaning of you'd find a huge failure among all those you ask maybe they will know the name the meanings of one or two maximum three of these names how would such people be called and classified as believers and devout Muslims when they don't know who they're praying to they don't know his names they don't know his attributes no wonder you would find this void in their hearts causing them to fall into sin after sin into mistake after mistake and to make all these errors and this is why it is essential that we when we do dawah we address these problems we try to fix them we try to elevate the people instead of just scolding them you don't pray you don't do hijab you don't do this you don't do that rather raise the bar let them come up and give them incentives so that they would themselves want to learn about Allah Azza wa Jal want to know about the Day of Judgment what will happen signs of the Day of Judgment they have to know what is heaven and hell they have to know what is the As-Sirat the straight path that they walk which is a bridge over hellfire how they can cross it they have to know what will await them in their graves and all these things that are Muslims have a big failure in so this is important that we address issues of Aqeedah before we address issues of ethics and moral conduct though they are important of course but we have to prioritize our teachings and our dawah so it would be effective lots of the people we talk to and if we address a particular sin or a mistake it might coincide with the right moment and they are susceptible to such advice so they take it they accept it they're grateful a couple of days or a couple of weeks later they relapse and fall into the sin again why because this was only the treatment of the symptom not of the core illness not of the void of the heart and remember the Prophet ﷺ spent 13 years in Makkah fixing this void of the heart and those whom he managed to have graduate from his school were the one who were steadfast when he went to Medina were the one who were steadfast in the Battle of Badr and in the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Khandaq, the trench and in the Battle of Hunayn they were the ones whom the Prophet called to come and they came to the rescue the Ansar, the Muhajireen, those who gave the Pledge of Allegiance under the tree they were the one who were steadfast because they graduated from the school of the Prophet ﷺ and they followed the correct methodology of fixing the void of the hearts until their hearts were strong and cemented with Iman. This is what we should do to our people in order for them to come back. Now it has to be noted that there is a huge difference between those who make mistakes out of sheer ignorance and negligence and those who make mistakes and sins deliberately while knowingly and this makes a huge difference when we give da'wah to people someone who's arrogant someone who's filled with pride and he does what he does equipped and ready to debate with you that what he's doing is right such people are dealt with differently than people who are genuinely ignorant they don't know the ruling and you can see that when you address both categories or both people the first one is defiant is ready to fight is not going down without a debate tarnishes it and makes it black such people are worthless they're not worthy of spending time with them because they know the ruling I remember once I was with a da'ee a very well-known da'ee who unfortunately went down quickly and he started giving coaching lessons and this and that and he left da'wah and he left lecturing and he left giving khutbas and the likes and he got involved in collecting money and he wanted me once to you know play with him some games sports games squash to coach him to coach him so I went with him a couple of times without addressing the issue of sheikh so and so he's not a sheikh anymore he's a brother why are you doing this why are you spreading among the people that hijab is not mandatory growing the beaders not mandatory praying in the masjid is not mandatory while five years ago you were on the pulpits shaking the whole masjid reinforcing that these are part of the essentials of islam and you were right back then but what happened to you so he started to defend himself oh you know sheikh this is an issue of dispute sheikh al-albani said so and so sheikh so and so said so and so I said don't cut to the chaste we say we have a saying don't sell water in the market where water sellers are around with buckets this is your trade and mine don't beat around the bush you know that what you're saying is is not true why are you doing this if you're unable to say the truth the least is refrain from saying falsehood this is a general rule in islam if you're unable to say the truth and proclaim it the least is don't back the people of evil and the deviant people refrain from saying falsehood just keep your mouth shut like the prophet said alaihissalaam whoever believes in allah on the day of judgment must say something beneficial or let him refrain from speaking so the the brother did not say anything when he was cornered and he could not defend himself and that was the last time i've heard of him may allah guide him back and all us sinners to the straight path and allah knows best i believe that we will elaborate on this point a bit further tomorrow inshallah if there is a life pre-ordained for us to live and we will inshallah elaborate a little bit further we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
