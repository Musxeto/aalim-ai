  "transcript": "consider subscribing from the uk well you have to check your eyesight because i come twice a week if you open youtube you will see me inshaallah i understand that okay now let's get down to the trees my question because today's question is related to commission so i work i give you an example i am a hat maker and someone comes and says to me i like zinedine i'd like you to make me a hat in this case i i said to him okay paying me the money this is how much money needed for the hat the design etc etc you pay this to me and i will make the hat for you and i will get it to you by a certain date so i take hack commission is this allowed first of all what you're asking about the hat making this is not a commission you are delivering a product and you're asking the person to pay you up in advance for that product whether it's a hat or a cup or a um any type of tailor-made merchandise for this person so if you ask for money in advance or you produce that product and then collect the money afterwards there's no problem there's no commission in that at all this is what you're getting for what you're making and this is known as istasnar when you make something drop shipping when we said that beyond is different because you're selling something you don't have and you're not going to make isla is when you do something you're producing something you're manufacturing something is when someone comes and says i'd like your mug and i say okay look at this mug these are the measurements this is the material it's made of you like it he says yes he said pay me in advance and i'll deliver to you on saturday so he pays me up full and then i go and buy it from elsewhere and provide it for him this is beyonce and both are okay you"
