  "transcript": "Sheikh I saw a video of you. My question is that in case of 22K of Sikatha will go old weight. One method is to multiply the weight with the current rate of 22K gold and take 2.5% of it. But there is a method in which we multiply the weight of 22K with 22, for example 200 grams and divide by 24 and calculate with the rate of 24K accordingly. So my question is which method is more accurate and why? Because the former gives me a result of 7-10,000 higher than the latter. So there is a noticeable difference between the results of both. Jazakum. Wa Jazakum. Again with the issue of gold. Take it to the gold shop, ask the gentleman to estimate how much gold is in it. He gives you a number, give 2.5% out. Very simple process. No headaches, no confusion, no half an hour calculating or multiplying by this and dividing by that. Take it to the goldsmith, to the jewelry shop. Salaam Alaikum Wa Alaikum As Salaam. How much is gold in this? He calculates it, gives it to you in a paper, give 2.5% and relieve yourself from this headache."
