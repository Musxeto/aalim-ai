  "title": "Is playing video games halal if studies prove they don't promote violence? (PUBG)",
  "transcript": "ali from the uk i had a question once you said that it was not permissible to play video games like pubg because of links to violent tendencies that it had with the player however from my understanding studies have shown that there is no link between playing video games such as pubg and having violent thoughts therefore if this is scientifically proven is it still haram to play these games thank you ali from the uk says that you said that pubg and other uh fortnights and and other games promote violence but studies prove that they do not promote violence it's been on my mind to download this game and play it for some time just to know exactly what it is because i'm completely oblivious when it comes to video games i hate them i've never tried them subhanallah something psychological maybe i don't know and until now i could not i know that this is one of the reasons that scholars say that playing it is not permissible among the other reasons is addictive people stay six to eight hours playing them it makes them engaged with others disbelievers relationships mixed gendering any free mixing uh because it's most of it done online and some of it includes betting and one of the games i think it was pubg or another game where they had a idol to pass a stage you had to go and prostrate and give sacrifice to the idol and then you move on to the following level and that caused a lot of uh problem in the muslim world and eventually they removed it but it shows you that these guys all what they want is money and they don't have your best of interest uh in mind so i believe that it does increase the amount of hostility and violence in children among other things so i would not say that it is halal um even if the studies prove otherwise i would say that's a great waste of time of the muslim that his feet as the prophet said assalamu would not be moved on the day of judgment until he's asked about his youth where he had spent it his time where it was wasted his knowledge what did he do with it and his wealth where he gained it and where he spent it in"
