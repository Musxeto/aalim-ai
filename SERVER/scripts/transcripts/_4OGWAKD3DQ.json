  "transcript": "man or says what is the ruling on color-coded Koran this helps integer weed and it has different colors for different topics this is an issue that is recent it was not found before at predecessors times so the scholars had to make HT hat and the most authentic opinion is that buying such a colored coded Koran is permissible why is that the scholars say that this adds value and for example dr. professor Haley says that Allah says well look at the eternal Quran Allah dickly if a hollywood film in medicare allah had made the Orang easy to be contemplated upon to be memorized to be understood and part of being easy to do so is to have these sorts of must-haves where you can learn how to recite it with tajweed if you have the basic knowledge integer eed so it reminds you that here we have alpha here we have Alam here we have this or that here we have a med by the different colors and by referring back to the code itself that tells you the information that you would like to learn so this is permissible and if it does not benefit it would not harm as some scholars say and allah azzawajal knows best"
