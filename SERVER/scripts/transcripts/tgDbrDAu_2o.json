  "title": "Can a woman freeze her eggs in Islam? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I want to know, is it allowed in Islam to freeze eggs for, I'm 39 years old, I don't have any children and I'm going through a divorce And I want to have children In Sha Allah, so my doctor advised me to freeze my eggs But I'm reading online that it's not allowed but it could be allowed in some cases And I just want to confirm that Jazakum Allahu Khair If we look at what you're asking, we would find that it is a bit beneficial but the harm and the sin in it is far greater than the benefit The possibility of these eggs being mixed with someone's else is not very little And there are tens of reports of similar incidents happening in the US deliberately and undeliberately Where corrupt doctors used to swipe and exchange these eggs and embryos just to please a couple or for deviant purposes of their own So the benefit is far less and the harm outweighs the little benefit of yours If you don't have a child after some time and if Allah does not will it, Alhamdulillah We live on this earth for only a limited period of time and then we go to hopefully Jannatul Naeem for eternity And there we will have as many children as we wish for eternity So I am inclined to say that this is not permissible and Allah Azzawajal knows best Al Fatiha"
