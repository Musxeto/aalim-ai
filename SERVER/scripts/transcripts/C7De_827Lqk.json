  "transcript": "Julie from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh You said when we wake up in the middle of the night and say la ilaha illallah wahdahu The full dua and then make dua that dua get accepted But what if we wake up hearing alarm should we still say these dua and make? Dua after turning off the alarm Yes, of course. There's no problem in that as long as it is the first thing you say Meaning that you don't wake up and engage in playing or talking or doing Useless things and checking the messages on your mobile phone rather the moment you wake up You turn off the alarm clock and you say the dua inshallah this works beautifully You"
