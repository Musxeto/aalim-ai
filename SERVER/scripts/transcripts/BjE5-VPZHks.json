  "transcript": "Milan from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wassalamu Alaikum. So basically for many months now I've been suffering from whispers from of the shaitan and basically I have this I've like grown this problem where I start like whenever I get these whispers which are usually about like hafir matters and stuff I usually like overthink them and and yeah so I usually overthink them and like I feel like I believed them when I didn't and whenever I try to ignore these whispers I still continue to overthink them so how would I so the main question I had about this was how would I like block these whispers out. Okay you have to book a counseling session with me if you can't afford it and if you can't and you hadn't had anyone any free session before with me you're entitled for one providing that you are poor and needy and can't afford it. These whispers are the easiest thing to solve but I have to do this one-to-one with you inshallah each person's demons are different from others and the way to open your eyes is very simple and quick you only need one session for that inshallah."
