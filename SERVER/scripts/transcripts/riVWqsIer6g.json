  "title": "Repeat ALL Prayers for Past Mistakes? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Saad from India. Saad. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam. Earlier, like one year ago, I did not have much knowledge about Islam. So I prayed in incontinence without meaning myself. I prayed at Dhuhr when the shadow passes the object. I prayed behind some Imams who do mistakes in Fatiha, for example my cousin or a friend. So do I have to repeat these prayers and I do not have a count of them? The answer is no, you don't have to repeat these prayers because one, there are so many. Two, you've done this out of ignorance. Three, the time is gone. So Alhamdulillah, repent to Allah, ask Him for forgiveness and move on with your life."
