  "transcript": "gentle for those from uh the us uh actually my question is about it where we sacrifice animals um my question is that can we do that in our country if we have few very few relatives in the united states and because if we do it in our country then more poor people and more relatives than you know um enjoy okay that is my question so the question is clear can we offer our our sacrifice for eid back home in bangladesh in pakistan in india and sri lanka and whatever the answer is yes is it the ideal thing to do the answer is no okay can you elaborate the sunnah is to slaughter a ram not in an animal either a goat a sheep a cow or a camel and slaughtering that animal sacrifice the sunnah is to eat from it now whether you divide it into three parts one-third as a gift one-third as a charity one-third you consume it with your family or you change the ratio this is up to you this is the sunnah to eat from it as the prophet used to do al-islam every single year but if it is difficult or you don't have the resources or the means to do that in your country because you live in the west and it's very difficult to go couple of hours drive to the farm and slaughter without the authorities knowing about it because it's illegal in some places or whatever if this is the case then there's no problem in sending and dispatching the money to your folks overseas well you can send it to syria you can send it to yemen you can send it to any impoverished area where they can do the slaughtering and benefit from it there's no problem in that again it's halal but it's not according to the sunnah and allah knows best we you"
