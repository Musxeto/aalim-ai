  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK. Sheikh, my question is, I have a non-Muslim friend who studies language, so in English the word Rahman and Raheem cannot be translated that way, it just says the most merciful and the entirely merciful, so just to know the literally the difference between them, I didn't tell him that this is from the Qur'an, so I just asked him what's the difference between merciful and compassionate, I just told him that and his first question was, where did you read it from? I panicked, I didn't know what to say, I just read it in a novel and then I immediately regretted what I said, then I realized what I said and I repented immediately and I was Really - , but I said my Shahaadah also, did I commit kufr by saying that? I didn't mean that, I just panicked and I said that, I got really scared after that, I don't know what to do, that's my question, Jazak Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum, Akhi there is no need to panic, you can easily say that I read Al-Rahman and Al-Raheem in a novel, I read it in a Qur'an, I read it in whatever you want to say, there's no problem in that, what's the problem? You didn't say that this was not mentioned in a Qur'an or this or that, so sometimes we panic over trivial things and this is a red flag, this is when shaytan is setting you up, so don't worry there is nothing wrong in saying that I've read Al-Rahman and Al-Raheem in a novel or in a news articles to avoid showing him that I read it in the Qur'an just in case, I see no harm in that and no kufr and Allah knows best."
