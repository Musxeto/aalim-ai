  "transcript": "[Music] um yeah i have a problem recently like each time when i pass through someone i normally have whisperings like don't you see the person is beautiful don't you see she has something beautiful and i'm obliged to say um mahala bless the thing and i don't even like it like it's due to the whispering am i obliged to say it or not or can i can i um can i not say it okay i will answer inshallah halima from nigeria she has this obsession whenever she sees anything oh beautiful car oh um beautiful child allah beautiful lcd screen allah mubarak beautiful watch so she says that this is becoming burdensome this is hard first of all it shouldn't be hard because whenever you say allah mubarak you're making dua which means that there is an angel saying and to you may allah bless whatever you have whoa so every time you make dua an angel makes dua to you so you shouldn't feel so worried or burdensome from saying such a phrase second of all not everything you like you say allah mubarak things that actually draw your attention so i'm driving i see a 1990 car model which is like 30 years old oh it's a good condition and i move on not like when i see a sports car 2022 top of the the the of its class and it's a a head turner and i like it now this is what i say allah mubarak by the way me personally i wouldn't look just not to give them the satisfaction of oh i'm turning heads nope i wouldn't look i just move on it kills them but i don't know this is something in me therefore there's no problem in saying allah mubarak but not on everything that actually you see rather on what really draws your attention and your admiration you"
