  "title": "If I make dua for Allah to guide a Kafir but don't give him dawah, will I be rewarded if he converts",
  "transcript": "but i don't give any doubt to that person if allah accepts my dua and guides that person will i be rewarded for every good that person does so basically ahanaf's question is i am a bit short of making dawah to a person but i make dua to allah that he guides him why don't you make da'wah to him directly i'm shy i'm afraid i have issues okay so now if allah responds to your dua and he guides him would everything good this person does be accredited to me because i was the cause of his guidance the answer is no you would not have anything to do with that firstly because you don't know whether it's your dua that guided him or 10 other people secondly most likely there were people working on the ground giving him dawah giving him leaflets engaging in conversation and arguments calling him and convincing him until he complied and accepted so you didn't do anything except dua and we do dua to all the muslims and the non-muslims alike throughout the whole year without being accredited for that good things that they do and allah knows best so you have to get off your uh back side and engage in calling them to allah azzawajal directly you"
