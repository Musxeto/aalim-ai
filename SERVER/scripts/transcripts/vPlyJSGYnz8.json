  "transcript": "as a man can I can I or should I get married if I'm not financially independent yet what if my parents allow me to live in their basement and we wouldn't have lots of expenses so the idea is being reliant on your parents but still getting married making it Hal and uh inshallah once you become financially independent uh that's another case but there would be a period of time where you are financially dependent on your parents and then from the girl's perspective as a girl how should I go about marriage if the guy I'm interested in is still in school and not financially independent yet this is a question very very prevalent amongst the youth I think there's barely any discussion where something like this doesn't come up so insh we will really benefit from what you guys have to say about this your parents feed you clothe you and give you a shelter so what's wrong in giving you face in their basement and get you married they'll be happy it's a win-win situation you will be protected from a lot of fitt you'll be able to focus on your studies and not be distracted and save your religion so definitely if you have parents that are willing W you have one of the greatest blessings of Allah marrying young is a I got married when I was 23 with the grace of Allah I was still in college and it is beautiful because you don't feel tempted anymore as a boy now girls are different unfortunately because it girls usually are shy to address this issue but when push comes to shove I think we have to put shyness away and she has to address this issue with her mom and with her aunties and tell them that listen I have I have to get married the Temptation is too much especially if the parents did the cardinal sin in putting them in un Islamic school in conventional mixed schools and we know what happens in these mixed schools so definitely the parents should Rec consider and try their level best to get her married to someone who fears Allah and they have to do their due diligence in trying to pick the most suitable person don't go for the perfect person because he does not exist a perfect person does not exist but you have to try your level best to check if the person whether girl or boy checks most of the boxes and fulfills most of the conditions for a sustainable relationship someone who's wise diplomatic knows how to communicate doesn't have anger issues generous and doesn't lie alhamdulillah and he's practicing of course and and does the whole nine yards alhamdulillah you will be inallah easy to uh uh get over that and Allah knows rest"
