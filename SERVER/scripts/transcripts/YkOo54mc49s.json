  "title": "Is Poetry Haram as I saw a verse in surah Ash Shu'ara about it, what about Rap Music? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] my question is regarding poetry so i think there is a verse towards the end of surat ashurah that speaks about uh poetry it does not make its haram okay recite foreign at the end so he says that is this or these verses condemning poetry as a whole the answer is no because there is an exception after all of this where allah says accept those who believe and do righteous deeds and they uh do good things and they avenge after they were oppressed etc so what they do with their poetry defines whether their poetry is good or bad and this is why even abbas the cousin of the prophet isaiah may allah be pleased with a man with his father one of the great scholars of the companions was asked about poetry so he said good poetry is good bad poetry is bad simple as that so if the poetry is used in praising allah in making dawah in defending islam in propagating the religion to others then that this is good the prophet islam had three poets hassan abner abdullahi and khabib numerix may allah be pleased with them all he had poets to defend islam to spread the religion once um saw hassan even the well-known poet of the prophet saying poetry in the masjid so he scolded him and he said you're saying poetry in the masjid so hassan looked at him and i said and he said to him i used to say poetry in this masjid in the presence of someone who's better than you in the presence of the prophet and the prophet used to encourage me and say say your poetry criticizing them the idol worshipers and may the holy spirit of jibril support you may allah to guide you and to make you say good things so this is good poetry the prophet alison used to sometimes ask his companions while traveling to recite to him some beautiful words of poetry that praise allah azzawajal and that draws people closer to allah subhanahu tahala and he would comment on it sometimes so good poetry is good but when the poetry talks about filthy things about describing women about haram things and this is what we found today find today in modern poetry so we can see in rap music for example and i wonder how muslims who claim to be muslims listen and adore such songs rap music pop music when all the lyrics speak about nothing other than sex violence and haram money how can muslims endorse this or watch such filth this is what is mentioned about being followed by those who are astray and the satans and the devils are the one who provoked them to do so and alano's best you"
