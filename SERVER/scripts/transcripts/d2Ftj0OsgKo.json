  "transcript": "Sheikh Assim: Muhammad from Nigeria.  Muhammad: you can help me what is the meaning of\nٱلْأَخِلَّآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍۭ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ   عَدُوٌّ إِلَّا ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Surah Az-Zukhruf: Ayah 67)? Sheikh Assim: (corrects   the callers' mistake in the ayah)\nٱلْأَخِلَّآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍۭ بَعْضُهُمْ   لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلَّا ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ\nMuhammad: Na'am (yes) This Ayah is a clear warning \nfrom Allaah azza wa jall to us mortals, who live on earth,   that we have to select our friends, \nand this topic by itself, it should   be devoted into like two or three lectures, \nbecause it's so hugely important in our lives, yet nobody pays any importance to \nit. Nobody pays any attention to it.   So Allah says in the Qur'an (translation \nof the meaning): {Best friends   on the day of judgment will be foe (an \nenemy) to one another,} Whoa! Why is that? {Except the righteous,} So if I have \nfriends in this life, he's my best buddy.   Is he righteous? Nope. Then why is he my best \nfriend? Oh man! This guy cracks jokes like crazy,   and it's all from the belt down. It's so \ngraphic, it's so obscene, it's so filthy!  He makes me laugh like crazy! Aah on the day of \njudgment he'll be your enemy. Why is this man your   friend? Because he knows a lot of people (influential), he has power and authority. So he,   if not breaks rules for me, he bends them and I \ncan get away with many many things Okay, he'll   be your enemy on the day of judgement. What about \nthis guy? Oh this guy! He is so filthy rich.   He deals with Riba, deals with extortion, deals \nwith bribes, and I get a lot of money off him, and   I'm happy, and I never tell him this is Halal or \nthis is Haram. You and him will be best of enemies   on the day of judgment. So this ayah tells you, if \nyou want to take a friend, a close friend, a best   friend, he has to be righteous. Someone if he sees \nyou drinking with your left, he says: My friend,   drinking with the left is haram. Drink with your \nright. If I have something in my heart saying:   What the heck?! Is he the moral police?! what \nare you doing?! If I hate what he's telling me,   this means that I am not righteous and \nhe has to take another friend. If I say:   (arabic) May Allaah reward you man. I need the \nadvice, I need people to come and advise me,   I need people to come and warn me, I need people \nto remind me of Allaah عز و جل and help me to do   good to reach Jannah, those will never \nbe enemies on the day of judgment."
