  "transcript": "so our first question people laugh make fun of my beard and call me mawlana is this mocking the deen i feel insulted whenever they call me this how to retaliate or deal with such we've answered similar questions to this before and there's no harm in doing that again insha'allah women complain people make fun of my hijab some call me ninja turtles some call me zuru some say funny things is this mocking islam others give similar incidents and to understand we have to first differentiate between mocking a ritual of islam or something that is proven without doubt that it is part of islam and mocking an individual for implementing that ritual or that sunnah either way is a heinous sin and a crime but it revolves between kufur and an act of apostasy and between being a major sin and something that a person must not fall into so if a person is acknowledging that growing the beard for men is mandatory and there's no dispute among muslims on this this is the instruction of the prophet salaam in various authentic hadiths and the vast majority if not the consensus of all scholars that it is prohibited to shave it so growing the beard is part of islam the dispute is in the length whether it is to be left alone untouched or that one can trim or cut short what exceeds a fist length it's an issue of dispute but the beard itself is part of islam it's mentioned in the quran wearing the hijab is something that is known by default to all muslims mentioned in the quran mentioned in the prophet mentioned everywhere by all scholars of islam so when someone makes fun out of that or mocks the fact that intoxicants are haram or mocks the fact that muslims for example shave their heads after performing hajj or umrah and he knows that this is part of islam but he says that's funny that's that's stupid that's so ridiculous they look like eggplants they blah blah and he makes fun of something that is part of islam a ritual of islam he knows that then this is an act of apostasy allah says in the quran and if you ask them they will surely say we were only conversing and playing say meaning o muhammad is it allah and his verses and his messenger that you were mocking make no excuses you have become kafir disbelievers you have lost your faith after being believers after your belief so this is a clear text stating that whoever does this just for the fun of it would exit the fold of islam even if he was mocking if he was playing around conversing now the second type is if a person mocks shaykh asam as his beard looks funny so he's mocking me as an individual not me as representing the religion or the beard being part of the sunnah of the prophet no no no he respects that but he is making fun of the individual in this case this is sinful but it is not an act of blasphemy or kuffur and one must refrain from that and allah azza knows best"
