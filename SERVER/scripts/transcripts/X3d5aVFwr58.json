  "title": "Remove Gold teeth before burial?assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The first question is from Khadija, she says, is it true that if I have some gold teeth in my mouth and I die, it must be removed before I'm buried? The scholars say that it is permissible to take a gold tooth when there is a necessity for it. Nowadays, Alhamdulillah, we have alternatives, artificial alternatives that would not necessitate that we use gold or silver as teeth. But if a person has one already and this person dies, this gold is money. It's a thing of value that now belongs to the heirs of the deceased. So if it can be extracted without mutilation, without harming the deceased, in the sense that without having other teeth fall because of that, if it can be extracted without any problem, then it should be done. But if not, then it should be kept. And if the heirs with their consent, they say, no, no, no, we don't want this golden tooth, let it be. We would like it to be kept with our deceased father or brother or loved one. Then Alhamdulillah, this is permissible without any problem, Inshallah. Alhamdulillah."
