  "title": "ðŸ†• Hindu girl reverted & married secretly, can she remarry now in front of her parents? assim al",
  "transcript": "Kavita says, I'm a revert and got married to a Muslim guy with his parents and a guardian, a wali, but concealed it from my own parents due to health issues and the danger that they may commit suicide because I'm their only child. Now things have become better and I want to get married to my husband in front of my parents but not tell them that we were previously married as it might cause severe health issues for them and them maybe cutting ties with me. Can we redo the nikah? This is an issue of dispute among scholars. Some say that once the marriage contract has been done, it cannot be redone again just for the celebration or for people to gather and relatives etc. as this would be mocking the marriage contract which was done. So it should be only done once. Other scholars say that what counts is the first marriage contract. So you guys are married now and whatever conditions were stipulated at the first marriage contract, whatever dowry was given, any conditions, all of this is fixed. It cannot be altered or changed in the following marriage. The following marriage is symbolic and it is a formality just for your parents' heart to accept your marriage and it's like a confirmation of the old marriage contract. So this portion of scholars say that it is permissible to redo it and inshallah I am inclined to this latter opinion that it is permissible to be redone and Allah azawajal knows best."
