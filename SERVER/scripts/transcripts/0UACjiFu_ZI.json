  "transcript": "[Music] foreign which translates to by time indeed mankind is in loss except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience servants of allah in this glorious surah which said may allah have mercy on his soul if allah only revealed this surah to mankind it would have sufficed them it would take it would take us ages to go through the pearls and gyms of the surah nevertheless allah swears and no one compels allah to swear because we know allah says only the truth allah makes an oath by time that mankind is at loss all mankind is at loss except for those who believe those who do righteous deeds those who advise one another to truth and those who advise one another to be patient while doing good deeds to be patient while refraining from sin to be patient to whatever calamities befall upon them as it was predestined by allah azzawajal the concept of loss and winning has a great deficiency and confusion among us muslims simply because our measuring stick the way we weigh things our standards are way different than what it is supposed to be if we look into the quran and to the sunnah we will see the whole world differently we will find that the definition of winning and losing is totally different than what we have in mind how does allah define to us the concept of winning and losing listen to this particular ayah in the the quran was not revealed for baraka only to be put in a glove compartment in your car to protect you from accidents the quran is not a form of decoration you hang on your walls the quran is not what many people think of it it is a book of guidance each and every word in it should add value should be a life changer if you are a proper muslim listen to this particular ayah allah says in the quran everyone shall taste death and only on the day of resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full and whoever is removed away from the fire and admitted to paradise he indeed is successful [Music] he's a winner he's the one who has succeeded this is how allah defines winning to us in the quran this is your main prerogative this is your main objective as a muslim living on earth for a limited period of time what is your objective to build a house to get married to have children your objective is to reach jannah this is your mission and if you have any other missions then you have failed the vast majority of us work live and exist as if there is no jannah as if there is no hell fire we only live for this dunya as if we are immortal as if we are going to live forever so heiber rumi one of the great companions of the prophet islam who used to live in mecca when he wanted to migrate to medina the idol worshippers prevented him and intercepted his way so now he's in the middle of his journey to medina they said you came to us poor you're an expat and now you've gained so much money because you were a good businessman we can't allow you to leave with this money so he threw his arrows on the ground and he said by allah you knew you know that i'm a good archer i will put an arrow in each person of you until they're over and then i will fight you with my sword till my last breath and that would cause a lot of fatality among you i'm a single man but if you want i'll bargain with you i'll tell you where my fortune is kept take it but let me be on my way to medina they weighed the pros and cons and said we'll take the money so he told them where his money money was attached and when he reached medina penniless no fortune he wasted 20 years of his life in mecca gaining money he's an expat this is why he came to this country yet he did not have any remorse because his target because his definition of winning was different and this is what the prophet alaihis salatu assalam confirmed to him when he saw him he said the first thing the prophet said your transaction was successful your mission was accomplished you did the right thing this is how they understood the difference between winning and losing and this is what you should ask yourself if you were given the choice between this dunya and hereafter which one would you choose the winners would abandon dunya and he said no i don't want haram i don't want things that would take me to hell i want i want allah's pleasure this is what i live for and this is what i shall die for the vast majority of the muslims are ignorant they are envious of the billionaires because they see that winning is to hoard is to collect is to gather wealth whether halal or haram irrespective it doesn't matter this is what they think winning is so you tell me a billionaire who gathered his wealth from haram a billionaire who will be asked on the day of judgement for every fills where did he get it from and where did he spend it in he will be questioned about it is he a winner or a loser you tell me a person who skips salat with the congregation in the masjid so that he would watch a football match or that he would not miss an oscar-winning movie is he a winner or is he a loser a man whose income is through riba interest is through bribing giving and receiving is through consumption of haram means you tell me is he a widow or a loser for us who pray in the masjid this is an eye-opener we surely would say he's a loser for those who don't pray with us who look at the car that's fancy or at the mansion that he's living in they think that he is a winner a sinful woman who does not abide by the hijab who wears makeup who wears tight clothes as we see in the malls and in the streets people are shocked muslims are shocked when they see someone who's hijabi i'm shocked i just came yesterday to see someone covering the hair masha allah but wearing tights and wearing revealing clothes and full makeup what a fashionista they call masha'allah is this islam so is this woman a woman a winner or a loser taking off your clothes is the easiest thing guys any woman can take off her hijab and adorn herself to look beautiful to others only winners can wear black from head to toe and conceal their beauty and accept the fact that they're modest chaste and god feeling and this is why allah says in the quran opening our eyes again a believing slave woman is better than apologist even though she might please you now this concept of winning and losing is what the companions lived by it's not something we say it's something that you live by and stick to if you ask the muslims harambe anybody who knows him the vast majority of have no idea harambe was the brother of um meaning that he was the maternal uncle of anas ibn malik whoa so he's a really high-ranked companion he was sent among 70 of the companions to the center of arabia to give dawa to the idol worshipper tribes tribes and as he was giving a presentation to one of the tribe leader this polytheist hinted to one of his soldiers to assassinate this die the guy is a peaceful person just telling him about to hate out of betrayal though they were the one who invited them to give them dawah this soldier came from behind harambe with his spear stabbed him from the back like any coward having that penetrating his chest causing his death now you tell me if you were in his shoes what would you have done harambe the moment he felt the stab penetrating his chest said i have won by the lord of the kaaba by allah i have won he did not remember his wife and children he did not remember the wealth he had left behind he did not regret a house he did not build he did not have remorse over war booties that he could not gain because he left his home with a sole purpose and that is to win and martyrdom was presented to him what more does he want the moment of death you see your life in front of you these people had one objective and that is to win and he attained what he came for what about our youngsters the youth today their trophy the concept of winning is to win the heart of a beautiful rich babe is to ride a fancy sports car is to gain money or the most modest of them all is to get one month vacation in europe where he's unwatched uncontrolled and unleashed this is the concept of winning to him those who follow the quran the sunnah those who put their souls on the palm of their hands their concept of winning is how many souls have i claimed on the battlefield in the cause of allah in jihad how many days have i fasted for the sake of allah when people were eating and drinking how many have i offered in the middle of the night while people were asleep how many jews of the quran have i memorized and revised and i have allah's words in my heart how many prayers have i managed to succeed in offering in the first row in the masjid and allah says in the quran then is one who was a believer like one who was defiantly disobedient they are not equal i hear what i say what you hear and i seek allah's forgiveness foreign alhamdulillah foreign one of the taberin says we were in an expedition and we were besieging noble in turkey and the byzantines were having their backs to the walls facing us so they had nowhere to go and we were at war all of a sudden one of the muslims barged alone to attack the enemy lines the other muslims said whoa he's throwing himself in harm's way he's throwing himself into destruction with his own hands among us was allah be pleased with him one of the great companions of the prophet hassam he was over 80 years of age and he was blind what is he doing in jihad he just wanted to die with the muslims and give them momentum and give them a number he wasn't going to fight but he was with them so when he heard what they said he said no no no no he's not throwing himself into destruction with his own hands because this ayah was revealed upon us the people of al-ansar the people of medina when we saw that victory was at the side of the prophet and he was victorious over all arabia we communicated with one another the people of medina and said okay islam has prevailed why don't we go back to our wealth our farms and fix it and try to make it as flourishing as is as it used to be so allah revealed in the quran and spend in the way of allah and do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction by refraining so abu ayoub says throwing our ourselves in destruction with our own hands meant that we fix our farms and leave jihad this is throwing ourselves into destruction aslam says abu imran abu ayoub continued to struggle in this asylum in the side of allah in jihad until he was buried near costa noble he did not fight but he was with them so that he would be with the people who are doing jihad this the seer of the ayah throwing yourself into destruction was the seer of the sahabi of a companion what is destruction to leave jihad to abandon pleasing allah in order for worldly gains so this is what we are doing at the moment when we do not believe do good deeds advise one another upon truth and advise one another to be patient when we refrain from jihad when we refrain from enjoining what is virtuous and good and forbidden forbidding what is evil and vice when we refrain from doing this we are throwing ourselves into destruction why because we fail to understand the meaning of winning and losing and i'll conclude with this final story that all of you know even your children who is he it's a long story to make it short a boy guided by allah to give da'wah against the king who was claiming divinity and claiming to be the lord of the people the king tried to kill him he sent him with a patch of his soldiers to throw him from a mountain the mountain shook they all fell and died he came walking to the king the king sent him with another group of soldiers to put him in a boat take him to the middle of the ocean and throw him so that he would drown the boat shook they all fell and drowned and the guy came walking the king was helpless so the boy told him listen you will not be able to kill me at all unless you do what i tell you to do so the king says okay what should i do so the boy said gather all the people of the village the people of your kingdom in this arena and tie me to a pole and take an arrow of mine and put it in the bow and before shooting me say it verbally and loudly bismillah in the name of allah the lord of this boy you claim divinity you claim to be god and now you're saying this so this foolish king did exactly what the boy told him and the arrow fell where it was shot and the boy passed away is he a winner or a loser indeed he's a winner in our standards the poor thing he could have lived another 10 or 20 years then what then he'll die but not as a martyr not with this impact and effect on the people when the people saw this they used to think that the king was their god when they saw this and they said if the king says bismillah then the lord of this boy is our lord we believe in allah the whole kingdom accepted islam on the spot the king felt helpless again his ill and evil advisors told him to dig trenches fill it up with fuel and light it up and whoever refuses to believe in him they will put him in the fire and he will die and perish the whole of the people refused to return back to their kuffur instead steadfast and died only believing in allah azzawajal this is the concept of winning in islam if you want to be a winner you have to abide you have no other alternative you have to abide by the quran and by the sunnah you have to call people to islam call them to goodness you have to enjoin virtue and good and forbid vice and evil you have to be patient because it will not come on a silver plate you will be harassed you will be abused because you are abiding by the sunnah we have to revive these messages through prayers through circles of knowledge through have the quran and memorizing the quran we have to support our brothers who are defending islam in palestine and elsewhere support them financially support them physically support them with dua how many of us make dua every single night before fajr in tahajjud that allah would grant our brothers who committing who are doing jihad to grant them victory how many if you say allah alhamdulillah i do it once a year you are a loser if you say i do it every night but i still feel that i'm not doing enough then insha allah you are a winner we have to open our eyes and see what islam is and teach our children and our wives what the concept of winning and losing in islam is if we do this maybe we will be among the winners in sha allah allahummafor wa fina foreign"
