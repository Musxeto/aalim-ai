  "title": "Judging by other than what Allah has revealed is kufr & calling others kafir Khawarij Assim AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "knowledge and the fifth type of is whomever rules with other than the sharia with other than what allah has revealed and commanded us to follow and this is kufar because you are obeying them you are believing in them allah says in the quran in so many places that following other than his rule is kufar allah says in the quran in surah al-mu 44 45 and 47 allah says and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are the disbelievers and in the following ayah then it is those who are the wrong doers or the unjust and two eyes afterwards allah says and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are definitely disobedient or defiantly disobedient three different descriptions to the same action which is whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed now this caused a lot of controversy the controversy is whether whoever rules with other than what allah has revealed is a kafir that must not be preyed upon that must not be buried in the graveyards of muslims that cannot be inherited by his family that his marriage is invalid that his children are born out of wedlock this is what a kafir is and between those who say that no this is totally legit and permissible and it's up to us to rule whatever we want to rule because the prophet sallam told us that we know our were world better than anyone else so these are worldly matters so there is a difference of opinion and scholars differed so you would imagine what people who are way less than scholars would do and this is where the khawarij originates from those like boko haram or the shabbat or the nicest non-islamic state of iraq and syria and those who give to fear and we don't say that all of them are some of them are might not have the same ideology some of them just wanted to fight for the sake of allah but the vast majority of those who do and indulge in such terrorist attacks there's no doubt in that so where did they come from they come from this very important topic is judging by other than what allah has revealed major cover or minor you read somewhere that even ambassador please with him when he came to the interpretation of 6 44 and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are the disbelievers he said that this is minor not major cover other scholars said these ayahs are being addressed to the people of the book the jews and the christians how are you implementing it to muslims and if you read the text the context you will find that it is in the jews and the christians so how to understand without starting to accuse one party over the other without labeling others it seems to me that the fairest of all and i'm not addressing the matter on the wall of course the fairest of the of all of these uh um texts combined is that the same principle applies to the takfir of the the the fear of the individual so we have texts in the quran stating to us that whoever does this is a kafir so whoever goes to a fortune teller and believes him he's a kafir and we know that whoever rejects any of what is known by default from islam whoever rejects it is a kafir whoever does not pray at all is a kafir and so on now these texts are known as general techfear but when you come it's it's like cursing whoever deals in riba is cursed by allah a woman who plucks her eyebrows is cursed a person who steals money is cursed a person who takes bride is cursed this is general i cannot come to mr nabeel and i say oh brother nabil you took a bribe from one of your clients so me allah cause you're cursed no i cannot come to someone who plucks her eyebrows and when i see her i say look at fatima fatima is cursed may i curse her why because she plucks her eyebrows and the prophet said that they are cursed yes but the prophet gave a general ruling for you to implement this ruling on a particular individual you have to have a set of conditions fulfilled and a set of obstacles not found and we spoke about this so many times so if a person prostrates to a statue a buddha for example i would say whoever prostrates to other than eliza mushrik is a kafir and this person is doing that this means that he's a kafir no there has there have to be conditions to be fulfilled one of them is knowledge so do you uh do you have knowledge do you know that what you're doing is cover i said no i never nobody told me this i just accepted islam a couple of weeks ago and we all processed straight uh we all okay it just told me that recording has stopped and then the recording is back and it stopped again is it on yes okay so why is it telling me that the recording is stopped anyhow so i asked the brother why are you prostrating to buddha he said i don't know all of my people do this i accept islam a couple of weeks ago so do i take him out of the fold of islam no because he the condition of knowledge is not fulfilled in him and the obstacle of ignorance is definitely fulfilled in him possibility number two what were you doing he said i dropped my glasses so i was looking under the couch for it and it took me some while until i found it subhanallah i thought you were prostrating to buddha no you're crazy i'm a muslim so maybe he was doing something you thought it was kufur while it wasn't maybe he would tell you that someone was putting a gun to my head and said that if you don't prostrate to that statue i'm gonna shoot you maybe he may be maybe oilfield and we have to ensure that there are no obstacles that are present that would stop us block us from giving him to fear and this is the most authentic opinion the general term tendency the general rule anyone who rules with other than the law of allah that he has revealed this is blatant major kuffar"
