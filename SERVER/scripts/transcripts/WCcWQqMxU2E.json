  "transcript": "or Wudu. The Prophet ﷺ said in an authentic hadith, Addil amanata ila man itamanak wa la takhun man khanak. Give whatever you've been entrusted with back to the lawful owner and do not betray who betrayed you. So you have to do your obligations. And another hadith, the Prophet ﷺ said, Addi ma alayk wa salillah ma lak. Do what you're obliged to do and ask for your rights, ask Allah for them. Now there are three categories of the society, the ruler, the husband, and the father. And in contrast, we have the citizens, the wife, and the children. So the ruler, the husband, and the father are obliged to do their obligations to the citizens, to the wife, and to the children. But if they don't do their obligations, the citizens are obliged to obey and be dutiful to their rulers. The wives are obliged to obey and always be ready for their husbands. And the children are obliged to be dutiful, respectful, and obedient to their parents even if their parents do not do their rights. This is a trend in Islam. Do your obligations and ask Allah for your rights. Otherwise, life would not go on. It would be stagnant. Everybody says, Nope, I'm not going to do this until you do this for me. And this life cannot go on. What did I answer your question? What was your question? Yeah, if he doesn't do, now, having said that, there are some aspects that if the husband does not do, then the wife can raise red flags. So if he does not provide for her, she's not obliged to give him his rights of intimacy. He doesn't provide, he doesn't give her a house, he doesn't give her food, and she's on her own. And every night he says, Simon says, No, Habibi, go somewhere else. Doesn't work here. Today we're closed. No service, no network. Because he has to. Allah says in ayah 34, chapter 4, Surah An-Nisa, men are protectors and guardians of women because one, Allah favored men over women, two, because what they spend over their wives. So if they don't spend, you have the right to refrain. Other than that, Wallahi, he doesn't take me out. He is not kind. He doesn't smile. He doesn't send text messages saying, I love you, I care for you, I feel dry in a relationship. These are not legitimate reasons and causes for you to withhold what Islam tells you to do to your husband, as I mentioned in my session, and Allah knows best."
