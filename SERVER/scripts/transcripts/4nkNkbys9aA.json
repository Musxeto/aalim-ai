  "transcript": "Waleed from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I met a Muslim brother the other day and he asked me what kind of Muslim I am. As in like what sect of Islam I follow. And I said I'm a Muslim and I follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah. And I advised him on the verse in the Qur'an that speaks about not causing division in the Ummah. And he said that I have to belong to a sect. And he cited a Hadith that eventually there will be 73 sects and only one will go to Jannah. And he says because it's 73 that one also has to be a sect. So what should I say to him? Tell him that I'm following the sect which is saved. I'm following the sect of the Prophet ﷺ and his companions. Duh! So what was the sect of the Prophet ﷺ and his companions? Such people argue without knowledge. First of all, saying that we have to belong to a sect, this is not true. We are Muslims. Now if you come and dissect Muslims into sects and cults. So are you Shi'i? Are you a super Sufi? Or a well-done or medium-rare Sufi? Are you a grave worshipper? Are you this? Are you that? Are you Qadiani? So they say, or Muhammadi, or Bahai, or Dirzi, or Alawi, and the likes. Okay, if someone asks you to identify yourself, you say, I am from Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah. I follow the methodology and the way of the Prophet ﷺ and his companions. That should be more than sufficient. If he wants more, he wants you to say I'm a Salafi, I'm a super Salafi. I am Athari, I am this, I'm that. Ignore such a person and give your back to him and just move on."
