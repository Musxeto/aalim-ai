  "transcript": "Khorram from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen Sheikh my question for today, it's been discovered that OCD isn't just an anxiety disorder but a brain disorder. Where brain scans of such people were different than normal people. Sheikh we also know that even though compulsive rituals provide temporary relief but they worsen OCD in the long run so a person should strictly refrain from compulsions. But if a person male or female suffers from such intense OCD that if they don't perform certain discomforting compulsions for example repeatedly gaining clarity over something from a religious scholar or abusing a service or a representative that was very poor in dealing Even leading to missed or qaza Salah. Increased urine incontinence and hence impurity and also deliberately wanting to keep sleeping due to depression and hence missing of Salah as a result. Should such a person keep performing the compulsions so that they can save their Salah? You may say that they should take treatment but they are already under medication Sheikh. First of all Akhi, people in Islam are one of two. Either sane or insane. Those who are insane, Allah has uplifted the pen of accountability so they are not held accountable on the day of judgment. If they don't pray, if they don't fast, if they don't mind their purity Allah would not hold them accountable because they are insane. Now people who are classified as sane and they know what's right and what's wrong. What's harmful and what's beneficial. If you bring them a burning coal, a hot firing stone, they would know that this is harmful, they would refrain. Someone who's insane would touch it, doesn't know. So a sane person is accountable on the day of judgment. Now psychiatrists may not be Muslims. May be Muslims but not practicing. And they follow their sciences that was made by Freud and the likes. And they try to implement it on Islam. And this doesn't work. We have to consult a Muslim practicing psychiatrist. Someone who knows the religion, ins and outs. And also knows his science and consult him. That person would give you the right answer. Because again, this is what we have in Islam. Sane and insane. Someone who comes and says, Wallahi I can't pray on time or I have to pray with najasa. Because if I don't and if I clean myself, this would cause me anxiety, it would cause me so and so and so. These people are bluffing. They're lying. If they're sane, they should know. Because if someone treated them in the same fashion, if her husband were to come to her and say, Wallahi I have this anxiety, if I treat you well I will do this and that so I have to abuse you, I have to beat you up and you have to bear with me because I'm under medication as well. Would she buy this? Of course not. And Allah knows best."
