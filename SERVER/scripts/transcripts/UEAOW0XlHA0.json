  "transcript": "[Music] from indonesia says there is a hadith where the prophet says obey your mother obey your mother obey your mother then obey your father so i would like to understand how is it possible and if my mom orders me to do something i should obey her more than my father first of all no fell the hadith is not as you had translated it the prophet said not did not say obey your mother a man came to the prophet and the man asked o prophet of allah who among the people i know is the most worthy of my good companionship so the prophet said your mother the man said then who the prophet said your mother the man said then who the prophet said your mother then the man said then who the prophet said your father so this indicates that your companionship should be 75 towards your mom 25 to yours towards your father this does not have to do with obedience this has to be with lowering your wing humiliating yourself being humble towards your mom more than your father why by default the mom is usually the underdog so children don't pay a lot of attention to respecting her or to obeying her or to be dutiful to her however the father is far greater in respect by nature because if you cross the line he would smack you on the face he would beat the heck out of you so by nature children respect their father and obey him while their mother are not like this this is why islam promotes being kind to moms to mothers and orders us and channels our respect and being dutiful more to our mothers than our parents than our father because the father by default is respected he's the man with the power with the money with everything while the mother is the merciful one the weak one the weakest link the poor thing and this is what is meant in the hadith not obedience as per obedience it differs from case to case and this is why when imam ahmed was asked my mom tells me something and my father tells me something else who should i obey imam muhammad said obey your father and do not disobey your mother so the guy was saying duh and this is the answer he cannot tell you obey one and disobey the other usually you have to obey them both but if someone says go right and the other says go left you have to improvise but still obey them both you have to be dutiful to them both and this is a very thin line that we have to walk and it's part of our testing you"
