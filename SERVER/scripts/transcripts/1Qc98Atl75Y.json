  "transcript": "Imran from Sweden so basically when um I was playing a game with people a guy I used to know he he I think he said that I wasn't a Muslim because I'm white and I'm not and I'm not ethnically like Arab or Muslim and I said them that then that and that means to a Muslim gets one out of Islam now you know what uh I did not tell him that he was a disbeliever but I told him that he did the action and I'm not sure if I had and he I think he didn't know have I have I done in val here you haven't done any Act of Tak by assuming that he made takir on you just because because he thought that you were not a Muslim due to your complexion due to the way you look due to your accent and your name for example so a person is not supposed to assume another is a cafir until he verifies it but at the same time he cannot assume that you're a Muslim if you are living in a cafir country look like them behave and act and speak like them unless you sayam alaykum or you say my name is Iman and and and the likes so therefore there is no takir here inshallah there is only hesitation of identifying a particular uh brother if he made the mistake of assuming that you were not a Muslim he did not do any Tak he made a mistake and likewise when you accuse him of doing teir on you that was a huge mistake from your part that was uncalled for you should not have said that and rather assumed the best of it and clarified it and Allah Knows Best"
