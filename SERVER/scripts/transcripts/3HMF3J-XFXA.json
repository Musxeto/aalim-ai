  "title": "Prayed the Hanafi way to unite the people & avoid confusion, was this Shirk as I pleased the people?",
  "transcript": "Ayun from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Okay, okay. Once I had to lead a prayer as an imam with a single person, an elderly man, who was a blind follower of Hanafi madhab. While praying with him, I intentionally followed the Hanafi practices, omitting certain sunnah like raising hands, placing them on the chest. I did this to prevent any potential trouble or confusion on his part. As I was concerned he might from form a negative opinion about my prayer or doubt the validity of his own. However, I'm now reflecting on whether this action could be considered shirk as I left certain sunnahs for the sake of shirk. No, this is not shirk. If it was made with the intention to gather hearts and not distract them and deviate them, there is no problem in that. You've lost the reward of following the sunnah, but there is no shirk in that, inshaAllah."
