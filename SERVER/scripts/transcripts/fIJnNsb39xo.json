  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, first of all, my name is Rafiq Naufal and I have a question. You are Naufal? He is also Naufal. Which one? The first one. Naufal. Yes, I am Naufal too. Yes, my question is, is it possible for us for not doing sin in one day? Thank you. Is it possible not to do a sin in one day? Yes. The Prophet ﷺ said, كلُّ بَنِ آدَمَ خَطَّا Every son of Adam has to do sin. Now, there are only major sins, there are small sins, there are sins that go in our minds, there are sins that we look at. So, I don't know of anyone who cannot do a sin. This is something that is in our DNA. But the Prophet ﷺ said, وَخَيْرُ الْخَطَّائِينَ الْتَوَّابُونَ And the best of those who are sinful, those who repent. And this is the beauty of studying Allah's beautiful names and attributes. And this is what I always emphasize upon. Do you know Allah's beautiful names and attributes? Yes. How many do you know? Can you write them all? Yes. You write them all, mashaAllah? Let's assume. Yes. If you ask people, how many of these names do you know the meaning? They say, ah, I know them, but I don't know what the meaning is. So, when I say al-Lateef, when I say al-Jabbar, when I say al-Samad, you say, hmm, Samad? Al-Mateeni. You don't know the meaning. So, if you can't relate to Allah's beautiful names, how will you find happiness in praying? So, now, one of Allah's beautiful names is al-Tawwab. So, if you don't sin, Allah will take you away and bring people who will sin and ask Him for forgiveness. And this is Allah's mercy upon us. He knows that we're weak. He's not telling us, come, come and sin. So, okay, go to nightclub tonight and then sin. No, Allah, forgive me. No. But Allah knows we're weak. We may fall and make a sin. Once we make a sin, immediately come, knock on Allah's door, ask Him for forgiveness and Allah will forgive you."
