  "title": "Good deeds like mountains turned into scattered dust - alone vs Publicizing sins, doomed in both?",
  "transcript": "Our first scholar is Ateeb from India. Ateeb. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, there are two hadiths. I am paraphrasing. In one hadith, the Prophet ﷺ said that on the Day of Judgment, people will come with mountains of good deeds and they will get scattered. Why? Because they used to transgress the limits of Allah when they were alone. This is the first hadith. The second hadith says that Allah will not forgive those who, when Allah concealed their sins, they like boasted about their sins or publicized them. So Sheikh, my question is, either way I am being doomed in a very serious way. So what is the correct explanation of these two hadiths Sheikh? We have answered this question many, many times and we've said that the first hadith, the hadith of Thawban, the servant of the Prophet ﷺ, may Allah be pleased with him, is referring to hypocrites who pretend to be Muslims while in fact they are not Muslims and they pretend to pray like us, to speak like us, to read the Quran like us, yet when they are alone they transgress and they do all sorts of disbelief as well as sins. While the second hadith is an authentic hadith as well and it refers to that each and every Muslim must conceal his sin and not expose it or disclose it to anyone or boast about it. And with the mercy of Allah and His grace, he will be forgiven. So these are two different hadiths and do not relate to one another and Allah knows best."
