  "transcript": "Arubi from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh is it must to do taqlid of the sheikhs of my own country or can I do taqlid of other countries Sheikh? Now how many times have you called Arubi asking about taqlid? Arubi Yes Sheikh How many times have you called to ask about taqlid? Why is the control cutting? Anyhow, this is an issue that seems, okay, the disturbance should be from Arubi's side. It seems that Arubi has a problem with OCD and with blind following, with taqlid, with schools of thought. And I've talked about this extensively on my YouTube channel. And we said that a person who is a layman at the very bottom does not have the ability to choose which is right and which is wrong, which means that he has to follow one trusted scholar. Her question is, is it a must that I follow a scholar from my own country, Bangladesh, or can I follow a scholar from a different country? The answer is, you should follow a scholar whom you trust in his knowledge, in his religious practice, in his akhlaq, in his judgment. You may not find such a scholar in Bangladesh, I don't know, you may not find them in Pakistan, you might not find them in XYZ country, but you may find them in Morocco, or Algiers, or in Saudi Arabia. Then you should follow the one that you trust and you feel that he is a good representation in front of Allah on the day of judgment."
