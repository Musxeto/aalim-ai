  "transcript": "and finally Ahmed says is it permissible to have two wives living in the same house but each have a separate room basically speaking Ahmed a Muslim man must provide his wife with a separate proper accommodation that befits her standard of living which means that she is not obliged to live with your family in a joint family she is not obliged to take in her house people she doesn't want if you manage to give her a separate room bedroom a living room a bathroom and a kitchen with a separate entrance where she is not obliged to see others that is her god-given right now if someone strikes the jackpot and both of his wives agreed to live in the same house and they have no ill feelings No Malice with the grace of Allah then this is their rights if they waver it if they say no we're fine with it we're okay to it in having one joint kitchen no problem but definitely they have to have their own separate bedrooms is it the ideal situation the answer is no because feelings of jealousy will inevitably come but if someone says no I have no problem and my wives have no problem alhamdulillah this is permissible it all depends on their consent both of them without any force or pressure"
