  "transcript": "Warisha from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam to Allah. So Sheikh, my grandmother, basically who's my maternal grandmother, she lives with us and we have like a joint family and my mother, my father and my three brothers also live. So Sheikh, I am almost engaged to a man who lives in America and he's a good practicing Muslim and I really want to marry him. And my mother and my father also want me to marry him as well. But once my grandmother said to me that you will not be able to come to my death if you obviously marry there because it's way too far. Otherwise, she's also happy with this and everybody's happy and she's also like okay with this marriage. So I don't know, but this thing kind of hit me and then obviously I discussed with her as well and then she was fine and okay with this. But I don't know like how to deal with it. There's nothing to deal with it. I would all do respect. We're all going to die. So this doesn't make any sense. If you leave this proposal and not marry that man, then your grandmother dies and another proposal comes, your father and mother would say the same. So you wait for them until they die. What kind of mentality is this? Who knows, maybe you'll die before them. Go and get married and move on with your life and don't pay any attention to such whispers of shaytan."
