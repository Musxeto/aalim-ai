  "transcript": "from nigeria can the charity of a kafir be accepted when he does this on behalf of a muslim well this has two faults first of all a disbeliever whatever good he does he's not rewarded for that and this reward is definitely not coming his way on the day of judgment so it would not benefit him he may benefit from it in this life so his health his wealth his food his drinks whatever good things happening to him this is a result from whatever good he did in this life but when he dies it's hell for eternity it's not going to benefit him now the the evidence would make whatever good they had done into dust now if he does this on behalf of a deceased muslim so in this life people benefited from this endowment he made a building and the revenue would be given to the poor so the puris are eating the needy are being they're getting their uh stuff fulfilled all of this is happening in this case he the kafir would not benefit from it but the deceased would benefit from it isha allahu azzawajal"
