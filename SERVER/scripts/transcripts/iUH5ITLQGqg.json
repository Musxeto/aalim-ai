  "transcript": "Nazar from India Shafi scholar stated about ra that it was abrogated at the last time of our Prophet Alat wasam as the Hadith of mas to an extent of exaggerating as authentic by sh Alani may Allah be pleased with him if it is authentic doesn't it contradict with the prayer booklet by shik albani where he himself raised the hand no these these these so-called Scholars are not telling the truth it was never abrogated and it continued to be as it is the Hadith of abdah Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and many many other Scholars approve that this was the way of the prayer of the Prophet Alat wasam and only to focus on and to waste time speak speaking about it shows how shatan is so happy and laughing at you and these so-called Scholars for wasting their time over something that is not of essence they're like an ostrich that puts its head in a hole in the ground when the Lions and the the tigers are about to attack and the ostrich says I see no danger there's nothing around me because its head in the ground you guys are doing the same thing the umah is be is being burnt to the ground Muslims are being slaughtered and and and confiscated from their property is confiscated they're killed and kicked out of their own lands and all what you care about is obligated so Subhan Allah this is insane it shows how ridiculous such people's intellect is when it comes to the life uh uh uh uh matters yes it is an issue of f we go and study it according to the F of schools of thought according to the Hadith authenticity but not to make it something that the apocalypse would follow afterwards"
