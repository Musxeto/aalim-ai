  "transcript": "And therefore, she does not do her Zuhur. Ateeb from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam No, you don't have to have such humility as long as you're not boasting about it or being arrogant about it. Whenever you do good deeds, the natural inclination would be that, I feel good. I'm satisfied. My chest is filled with peace and tranquility because of Allah's favors and blessing upon me due to this good deed. There's no reason for me to have negative thoughts and say, oh what if Allah does not accept my good deed? What if I'm a hypocrite? Why? You did it for the sake of Allah? Yes, I did. You feel good about it? Yes, I do. Are you boasting or feeling arrogant or feeling tempted to do sins because I've got credit? I can afford it? No, I don't have any such ill feelings. In this case, you're, alhamdulillah, in good."
