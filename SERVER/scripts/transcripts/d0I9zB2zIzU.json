  "title": "Can I give my insurance card to a poor relative to seek medical treatment? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "her second question was regarding medical insurance she says that I know that medical insurance is not permissible however my company obligates me to issue or to participate in the inch medical insurance scheme or the government forces this upon us so is it permissible if I have a poor relative to give her my cart to go and get treatment or to be operated upon by a particular hospital who would not ask whether she is the real cardholder or not so by this I would help my poor relative and at the same time utilize the money that I had paid the answer is totally No Islam prohibits cheating Islam prohibits lying and you're doing these two things by giving what you were entrusted with and that is your insurance card regardless whether insurance is halal or Haram it's something that was obligated upon you and you had to participate in order to obey the law and not to be fined not to be arrested not to be sacked from your job so you have justification for that what you do not have is the justification for cheating the insurance company cheating your company cheating the government by giving this card to someone else and that person would say yes my name is consume and he has a long beard probably and he's a man and and they say no problem and they take the card and they charge it to the insurance company this is lying and Allah prohibits collaborating and cooperating on vice and sin and this is definitely one of that so I hope this answers your question"
