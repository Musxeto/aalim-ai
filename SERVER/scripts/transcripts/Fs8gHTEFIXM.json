  "title": "Must I pay cash or offer food to expiate a broken OATH? (Paid 5 pounds per person) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "My question is, Sheikh, regarding, so if a person who breaks an oath, he has to feed ten poor people, right? And pay the fidya. I paid it before and then, I didn't pay it fully because I just searched up the average money it costs to pay a meal and then I paid it then. But then I found out the fidya price is actually £50, so £5 per person. So, but there was another time, Sheikh, which I paid for an oath which I done, but that oath was when I was like a child, so I didn't have to pay that oath, so that money that I spent that time, I had the intention to pay for my oath, so can that money go to fill up the one that I broke my oath with? First of all, the expiation of breaking an oath is to choose between one of three. Either to free a slave, which is not applicable nowadays, or to feed or clothe ten poor Muslims. And if a person is unable financially to do any of the previously mentioned three, he has to fast three days. Now, the hadith or the ayah specifically states on feeding, which means if you give £5 to a poor Muslim, or £50 for ten poor Muslims, that would not suffice and would not expiate your broken oath. Because you have to actually feed them by buying them food and giving it to them. Giving them cash is not sufficient. If you authorise a charity organisation on your behalf to buy food and feed these Muslims, that is also sufficient. So you state that this is £5 per person, buy food and feed the poor and they committed to that, this is valid. What you have expiated in the past for an oath you thought you needed to expiate is gone. If you made oaths while you were a child and did not reach the age of puberty, this does not oblige you to expiate because you were not accountable at the time. So the money that you have given is gone for charity, but it cannot fill in the gap of nowadays broken oaths, and Allah knows best."
