  "title": "Is Tawaruk Allowed in 2 Rakah Prayers Too? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Nazar from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, does the position of Tawarruq in Salah is to be performed only in second Tashahud or can it be done in the Salah of two units at the end? Jazakum Allah Khairan Wa Jazakum. This is an issue of dispute. Imam Shafi'i School of Thought say that this is to be done in the last Tashahud. Whether you're praying two Raka'a like Fajr or three Raka'a or four Raka'a like Maghreb and the rest of the fourth prayers. And other scholars say that no. Tawarruq, which is to sit on your left buttocks and you put your left leg underneath your right leg, is to be done only in a prayer that has two Tashahuds, which means that it is either Maghreb or Zuhr, Asr or Isha. Four Raka'as. Because in the first Tashahud, you sit normally. In the second and last Tashahud, which is the final thing, here is where you sit in Tawarruq and this is the choice of Sheikh Al-Albani and this is where I'm inclined to follow."
