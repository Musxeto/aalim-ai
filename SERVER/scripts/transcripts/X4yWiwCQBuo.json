  "title": "After night Athkaar, can I talk or must I sleep immediately? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Okay, what's your second question? And the second question is, adhkar to go to sleep. So after the adhkar, can I still talk to my husband or after the adhkar I have to go to sleep? Okay. JazakAllah Khair. Wa JazakAllah. As for the second question, in terms of the bed adhkar, the vast majority of them you can say them and still engage in communicating and talking with your husband or your children or using the phone as long as you're on your bed. So it doesn't matter what you do after that. It does not nullify them, except with the hadith that is highly recommended to be the last thing you say. Allahumma inni aslamtu nafsi ilayk wa wajahtu wajhi ilayk. This is the hadith of Al-Bara' ibn Aazim. This is highly recommended. And there is another hadith which I may recall later down the line, that also is recommended that you say the last. But mainly speaking, the hadith of Al-Bara' ibn Aazim should be the last thing you say before going to sleep. If you speak once again, then repeat it once again so that it would be the last thing you say and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
