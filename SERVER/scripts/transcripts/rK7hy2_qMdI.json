  "title": "Can we submit donation slips of Zakat or charity to get Tax Deductions or Exemption, Zakat affected?",
  "transcript": "a sister says recently I've learned that my country has the option to exempt tax for the donated amount if we submit our donation slips as proof is it permissible to submit donation slips of my zakat or charity to get tax deduction will my zakat be affected by this first of all the issue of exemption in zakat the exemption of taxes this is something that is required and sought after why taxes are taken from my own hard work in Islam taxation is not permitted due to the fact that the prophet said your wealth your uh uh safety and your reputation is Haram among you o upon one another like the prohibition of this land in this day in this sacred month so it's not lawful for me to go to an employee and take money of him and say this is for this or that without his permission likewise it's not permissible to lose money from my heart earned wealth for any reason unless there is a real legitimate reason that can be justifiable and this is something for the major Scholars to look into and justify so if there is a legitimate way a legal way where I can skip taxes without falling into breaking the law that is totally legit and this is something worldwide is being practiced whenever there's a loophole people do it and it's not tax evasion it's not skipping unlawfully because I'm following the law but the law when they take from my own hard earned money without any justification islamically this is harammani so if I pay zakat or a donation and I get a slip and I can get Exempted from paying my taxes there's no problem that my zakat my charity are all fine and uh Halal insha Allah"
