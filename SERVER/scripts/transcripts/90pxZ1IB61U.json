  "transcript": "aMDA says when should the person who's given poor Bonnie mention his name and the name he wants to include in his sacrifice is it at the time of buying the animal or when actually slaughtering it okay first of all let's do some translation what's the meaning of poor Bonnie our body is the older way of saying over here the Muslims the Arabs consider it as over here because this is how it is described in the Sunna and in the books of folk Orban is a sacrifice it's an originally Arabic word but poor Bernie has nothing to do with the Arabic so but it's used in the subcontinent and we explain it just for the people to know so I mean amla's question is this sacrifice for people who are not going to hatch so we the people the Muslims are divided into two types pilgrims who are going for Hajj and none pilgrims who are the vast majority of the Muslims those non pilgrims it is highly recommended son demo akkada for them to sacrifice and to slaughter a Ohia a ram or 1/7 of a cow or 1/7 of a camel so seven can share in a cow seven people can share in a camel and one person can sacrifice one sheep one goat when Ram a man is asking about this Ram I'm going to sacrifice is it permissible for me to include others in it the answer is yes providing those others are among the living who live under your roof so if I have a big family and I have my children and I have my grandchildren they all live under my roof they all eat from the kitchen in the house which I provide them food or they may contribute but it's the same kitchen that cooks the food for all in this case one sacrifice one sheep or one seventh of a cow or 1/7 of a camel suffice says for the whole entire family who live under my roof as for the dead I also am entitled to include the dead so I include in my same ram the living under my roof and those who have died such as my father my mother my grandparents my uncle my cousins now when do I have such an intention is it when I buy the ramp from the souk from the market or when the actual slaughtering is done the answer is when the actual slaughtering is done however do I have to say it so before slaughtering or before the butcher starts to slaughter I say listen this is on behalf and I get my list on behalf of so and so and so and so and so and so do I have to do this no is it the sooner some scholars say yes because the Prophet used to Adam say this is on behalf of my family and the Ummah of Muhammad so uttering it is just a Sunnah it has nothing to do with the validity of your sacrifice it has nothing to do with your intention so what counts is my intention so if I just go to the butcher and I say listen this is my sacrifice slaughter it for me and I don't tell him on who is it this is sufficient I don't tell him who on who it is this is selfish all what I need to know is that I personally know who is it intended for and this would suffice insha'Allah I'd like to add if I may there's no there are no callers so I can afford that a lot of the brothers and sisters in the subcontinent take it religiously upon themselves that slaughtering a poor Bonnie or Latvia is mandatory upon each individual so you see a household with ten people living under the same roof under their father's roof and they insist on slaughtering ten sheep every single year and this adds a lot of burden upon them financially and it is not part of the sooner the sooner is the slaughtered one this is sufficient and does the job now if you have if you're a millionaire or if you are well-off and you'd like to slaughter more this is okay no problem but to believe that it is an obligation upon Aisha and Fatima and Khadija and asthma and about Mohammed and Abdullah all the offsprings and the siblings living in the same house no this is not mandatory and there is no such thing as a sin if none of them slaughters except the father of the house there is no sin at all there is not even going against the Sunnah it's totally legit so people could utilize the money elsewhere"
