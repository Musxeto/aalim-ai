  "transcript": "he says is it permissible to download books install cracked versions of Windows operating system etc this is a frequently asked question and why people ask about it is because they believe that they're doing something wrong and the Prophet defined that in his salat wa salaam sin by saying whatever is scratching you from inside and you don't want people to know about so whatever you feel that it's not good and at the same time you don't want people to know about it most likely that this is sinful we know that Islam protects other people's rights so even if a person is a non-muslim it is totally prohibited for a Muslim to trespass his property or to steal anything of his wealth or of his possession just because he's not a Muslim does not mean that he has no rights and likewise big corporations or authors they have rights as well usually Satan comes to us and says these big corporations are filthy rich so they would not be harmed by us taking some of their products for free especially if this product is found for free on the internet or I can buy it in the market and it's either forged or an imitation or a replica so what's in is it on me well the vast majority of scholars of Islam prohibit this and they say that people have worked hard to produce such a product and by coming and stealing their right or buying a cracked version or something that's a replica you are harming them and hence this is totally prohibited therefore you cannot buy Photoshop cracked version or Windows operating system cracked version or any of the videos or that is audiobooks that are available that are also not legal because all of this goes in the same or under the same category which is invading people's rights and deprive the depriving them from what the it is lawfully theirs and Allah knows best"
