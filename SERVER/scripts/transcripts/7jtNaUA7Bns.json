  "transcript": "ABD from the from UK uh I had a question asked on the website but there wasn't enough characters I try to be as quick as possible um I was wondering if OCD or with sins or is a real thing so for example an OCD with what like s and um for example uh if someone like ask me if I'm hot I said no and then a few minutes after few minutes after I think was I was I actually hot not hot or was I lying even though there's no reason to lie or sometimes if I might make a face and I think did I do ham or LS and like I'm Critical with myself and repent from things that I'm not really sure sins just to be safe rather than sorry but this makes me feel feel sometimes that I do a lot of sins okay first of first of all this is becoming a mental illness and it has nothing to do with Islamic rulings when a person reaches a stage where he doubts his own actions his own intentions his own feelings it's a clear sign that shitan has taken over the driver's seat and that the individual has given control to Shan Shan has no control over humans as Allah stated in Surah ibraim verse 22 I had no control over you other than to call you and you responded and answered me so don't blame me rather blame yourselves so he has no control over you but if you keep on being hesitant and Confused us and reluctant to make a decisive decision and follow through this is what's going to happen always cast the doubt all psychiatrists Muslims and non-muslims alike along with the scholars say that OCD and WIS swas cure is to ignore but if you keep on overthinking this is the worst tool and weapon that Satan uses against you to overthink oh I may have committed shik I may have committed kufur I my my prayers might be invalid maybe my my woodo is invalid I repeat the W 10 times I repeat the shahada 20 times or 50 times a day this is what Shan wants may Allah protect us"
