  "transcript": "Okay, Saad from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, I have a nine-year-old child with my ex, who I regularly remind to keep in touch with the dad. Even though the dad does not bother whether the child calls or not. Allah knows my intentions are good. I want my child to have a good relationship with the dad. However, this man always have negative things to say or hurtful words to me. My question is, as a mom and the child is nine years old, am I obliged to tell my child to call the dad or just leave the child to call whenever she wants? As a mom and a Muslim woman, you have to know that your son has a relationship with his biological father in Islam and has responsibilities towards his father. Whether you like it or not, whether his father is abusive, evil, not practicing or not. He still is obliged to obey and be dutiful and respectful to his father. So, I would highly advise that he makes it a habit to call his father once a week or once every 10 days just to check on him and so that he may soften his heart after six, seven years. You never know. But inevitably, it's like your fingernail. You cannot just take it off unless you're tortured. This is part of your body and his father is part of him and he is part of the father and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
