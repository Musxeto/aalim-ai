  "title": "Should I give Salam to people who do acts of Shirk",
  "transcript": "number one Faizan Shareef from \nIndia he says, I have relatives that do acts of shirk and i'm not an expert in \ntakfir and at the same time i know that we   can't pray behind them so should i give them salam \nor not okay this is a package deal the default is   a person is a muslim his name is ali his father's \nname is abdullah his family name is a muslim name   so they're muslims by default if you ask them and \ngive them the microphone are you muslims he said   of course so this is the default now what they \ndo which is regarded to be acts of shirk is   the thing that's coming to remove this \ncertainty of them being muslims therefore   it has to rise to the level of certainty in order \nto remove a certainty they're muslim by default   that's certain in order to take them out of \nthe fold of islam i have to have certainty   till i have that certainty i assume \nthey're muslims i say salaam alaikum   without any problem now sheikh they're going to \ndhargas they're doing shirk they're doing that   okay i know these acts in order for us to take \nthem out of the fold of islam there are a number   of conditions that must be fulfilled and there are \na number of obstacles that we must ensure they do   not exist to prevent them from prevent us from \ngiving fear and usually this is done by scholars   so if you're not up to it in this case don't \nassume that they're mushriks give them salam   for the benefit of the doubt and allah knows best"
