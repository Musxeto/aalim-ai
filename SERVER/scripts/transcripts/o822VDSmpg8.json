  "title": "Is it mandatory to perform Hajj first or Umrah? | Assimalhakeem-JAL",
  "transcript": "abraham from the uk he says someone who did not perform hajj or umbra before is it mandatory for him to perform hajj first or can he perform umrah well if we look at the sunnah of the prophet salaam we would see that he performed umrah before hajj as he did in the um and his hajj was on the tenth year of hijrah however there is no difference of opinion that a person can go for umrah before hajj sometimes all what a person can do is perform umrah because he doesn't have the financing for hajj even if he saves for many years so there's no problem going for umrah first however if you know that if you wait a year or two you'll be able to collect money that enables you to go for hajj then definitely that would be a wiser decision but it is not mandatory if you go for umrah first and then you go for hajj later on this is totally legit"
