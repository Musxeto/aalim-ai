  "transcript": "uh finally mehush says will someone's severe dua against me come true if i was oppressor for example if i pulled my sibling's hair and they made dua saying may allah never forgive you would that come to reality first of all it is established in the authentic sunnah that the prophet said beware of the dua of the oppressed be careful beware of the dua of the victim because there is no barrier between it and allah which means that if you oppress someone your wife your servant your colleague your partner and they make dua that allah avenges them their dua will be answered and accepted now pulling your siblings hair is an act of aggression not forgiving you is transgression and dua if they were limiting the forgiveness in relation to their aggression which is pulling your hair that would have been accepted and yes allah will accept this but to not forgive all of your sins because such of in return or in exchange of such a small uh aggression or sin that would be transgression and hopefully allah will not accept this but at the end of the day it is in allah's hands and you must avoid oppressing people in order not to fall in such a threat and allah knows best you"
