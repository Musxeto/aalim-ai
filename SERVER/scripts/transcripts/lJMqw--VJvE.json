  "transcript": "damira says if i am on the way to a particular destination and it's time to pray and i do not find a woman designated area can I pray in the car seated in the sitting position for the fear of missing it altogether this is a frequently asked question by the sisters now if you notice from her question she is either a traveler or she's commuting within the city if she is a traveler the Sunnah is that it is permissible to pray sitting even if you're not into the direction of the Qibla providing that you're praying voluntary prayers because this is what the prophet has some used to do but whenever it was time for fault he would dismount of his right and pray standing up facing the Qibla this is a must standing up is a pillar facing the Qibla is one of the conditions of the Salah of salat of prayer now if you are unable to do this because you're on a bus or you are in a car and the driver is not willing to stop in this case these two conditions and pillar may be you be exempted from them due to necessity in you may pray again this is when you're travelling between cities if you're residing so you are in a city and you are with a driver are you driving yourself or with your husband and it's time for prayer it is totally prohibited for you to pray sitting in the car and I am astonished by a lot of the sisters asking the same question when it is possible to simply park your car and pray on the pavement on the road by that by the road don't pray on the road they will hit you but on the side of the road you don't have to pray in a concealed place or in a message you can pray in an open Park sisters who say oh sure people would look at us so you're wearing your hijab you're praying you're not playing or dancing or like immoral women do jogging in front of people and people people are watching you bounce among other things you are offering prayer in a very tranquil nice and peaceful postures there's nothing wrong in that none whatsoever but you cannot pray in the car when you are in City Limits commuting just because you don't want the people to look at you"
