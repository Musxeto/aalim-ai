  "transcript": "redwan says what does it mean when allah says he guides whom he wills is everyone not given the option to be guided yes everybody is given the option to be guided but do you know whom allah will assist to guide and whom allah predestined 50 000 years before creating the universe that he would be guided the answer is no destiny or al-qaeda is the ability of allah and one of the brothers may allah azza uh grant him great rewards corrected me because he said that he heard me say in a previous comment that imam ahmad says when he was asked about allah's destiny he said this is allah's knowledge and this is not the right quotation imam it says destiny is the ability of allah azzawajal of knowing what will happen of making it happen willing it to happen and creating it so all of this is part of destiny and you cannot say that i can guide myself because you can no one can guide himself guidance is in the hands of allah azza which literally means he the almighty guides whom he wills and misguides whom he wills is this possible of course aren't we all his creation yes aren't we all his possession yes isn't he allowed to do whatever he wants yes if he were to gather the whole universe and toss them all in hell the righteous and the sinners would anyone be able to object to that no don't they all belong to him and he has the freedom to do whatever he wishes yes so allah azzawajal created us allah owns us possesses us but we know for certain that he's fair he's just he's knowledgeable he's wealthy and capable so when we know these factors along with the fact that he is the owner and the creator of us then we feel safe and content allah showed us the way whether to go right or left and he told us if you go right you'll be guided if you go left you will be misguided and he made things easy for us so if we were to choose to go right allah will guide us and will will to guide us and if we choose to go left allah would misguide us and help us to be misguided because it is our choice we took it with our own free will does allah know what we will choose yes then why and how could that be free will it is free will i chose him knowing what i'll choose and him supporting me in my choice has nothing to do with my choice so we have to understand this concept that allah does what he wills it is no one can be guided without his guidance and that he is fair and just and knowledgeable and allah azza knows best you"
