  "title": "Standing up in Court before the Judge Permissible in Islam",
  "transcript": "Shafkat from the US. Jazakallah khair for sharing authentic knowledge. Barakallah fika. Yesterday's lecture you mentioned categories of individuals who Muslims should stand for. In the USA court it is expected that people stand when a judge comes into the room and again when the judge leaves the room. Is this permissible? Jazakallah khair. Wa jazakum. Islamically this is not permissible. However, if a person does it, he's sinful. He did not commit shirk. If a person would be thrown for contempt of the court and for insulting the judge and they will throw him in jail for a day or more, in this case, yeah, what the heck. You should not stand up and sit without any belief in the judge or the court or what they mean to you. But if your constitutional rights, as they say in the States, give you the right not to stand up and you want to sit and there's no legal implication upon that, no, you should not stand up. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
