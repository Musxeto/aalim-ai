  "transcript": "now why do people get with us and this is the one million kuwaiti dinar question i get so many counseling sessions with the grace of allah eighty percent of them is on with us and with the grace of allah azzawajal those who come rarely come back again because it takes them few minutes to understand but they need to have this in their minds shaytan comes to you when you are inclined to be religious and pious he doesn't come to you with these thoughts of cleanliness and purity if you're ignorant if you don't pray on time if you party all night long if you free mix if you neglect salat he doesn't even bother with you on these topics he has a different agenda because people are divided into two types when it comes to whispering of shaytan so if you're inclined to be practicing if you fear allah fear hell fire fear that your prayer is not going to be accepted you are a fertile ground for shaytaan for iblees for satan to mess up with you so how does he do it he approaches those who have little knowledge and with little knowledge you can do wonders if someone has little knowledge i can make him a terrorist i can make him an infidel i can make him leave the fold of islam i can make him do heinous things he has no knowledge so i can control him i can play with him i can mold him as i wish once you get the knowledge then you have surrounded yourself with a very high fence that it is almost impossible for shaytan to penetrate or to cross over"
