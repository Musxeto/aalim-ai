  "title": "Part of remorse is to fear Allah will Not forgive you but Allah is how you think of Him?",
  "transcript": "[Questioner: Saliheen] He says; 'I \nhave a confusion between you saying   that 'part of the remorse is to fear that \nAllah, Azza wa Jal, would not forgive you   and there is a possibility that Allah would \ntorment you'. And this confuses me because,   there is a hadith where Allah says, \n[أَنَا عِنْدَ ظَنِّ عَبْدِي بِي].   Allah is talking about Himself. 'I am at how My \nservant thinks of Me'. So how would that be, if   I fear that Allah would not forgive me? Wouldn't \nthat be overthinking, or negatively thinking of   Allah, Azza wa Jal? The answer is 'No'. There's no \ncontradiction none whatsoever. Because, if you go   through the Quran thoroughly, you will always find \nthat Allah mentions fear and hope side by side.   The Prophets and Messengers of Allah used \nto supplicate to Allah in fear and in hope.   And if you read the hadiths of the Prophet, \n'alayhi salatu wa salam, so many times he   would say, 'if you were to know what I know, you \nwould have laughed a little, cried a lot and you   would have gone on the open fields in the deserts, \netc., wandering on your faces because of the fear   of Allah, Azza wa Jal. And he himself, 'alayhi \nsalatu wa salam, used to wake up at the night   time praying and weeping until his tears would \nwet his beard and the floor underneath. 'Why would   he do such a thing? Doesn't he think positively \nof Allah Azza wa Jal?' You're mixing things up.   There is a difference between thinking negatively \nof Allah, Azza wa Jal, until you despair of His   mercy. So, 'No, no, no. Allah is definitely \ngoing to put me hell. No way Allah would   forgive me. Nowhere I will enter paradise.' What \nare you doing? Allah is Most Merciful. 'No, no,   no, not to me. He's not go~..' No, this is \nextreme and this is where the hadith goes   against it. And you are thinking negative of \nAllah, Azza wa Jal. And on the other side you will   find people putting it in low gear and would say, \n'Alhamdulillah, we're cruising.' Akhi, you have   so many sins. Ask Allah for forgiveness. Come and \npray. Do something. Do good deeds. [Says] 'No, no,   no, Allah will forgive all of my sins. Allah would \nput me, the first person in paradise. I know that.   I think well of Allah, Azza wa Jal.' So these are \ntwo extremes. You will not be part of Ahlus Sunnah   wal Jamaah. And a true believer, until you merge \nand combine between two conflicting feelings, that   can only be when worshipping Allah, Azza wa Jal. \nSo you fear Allah, but when you fear something in   this world, you run away from it. Allah, when you \nfear Him, you run to Him. Subhana Azza wa Jal. And   you hope and wish in Allah's forgiveness \nand mercy and paradise. And these can   only be merged and combined when worshipping \nAllah. And I hope this answers your question."
