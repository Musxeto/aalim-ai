  "transcript": "from Canada Sheik my question uh today is that some women claim that uh it is not permissible these days to uh or recommended even to marry more than four wives because they say that the prophet and the sahabah married more than one wife uh in their time only uh those who were orphan girls or the widowed women who uh whose men folk died in war and uh and so on um so is this uh something like a valid claim they said they are only supposed to we're only supposed to have only one wife these days and if it is uh even if we uh want to marry more than one wife to have uh more children this is not permissible and it is disrespectful and objectifying women is this something correct okay first of all you uh maybe a correction maybe you've said this without paying attention to it's not recommended to marry more than four it is prohibited to marry more than four wives I think you meant to say it is not recommended to marry more than one so yes what they say is an Islamic ruling so these women when they come and object or give a verdict regarding whether it's recommended or not recommended and base their evidence and logic behind it this is an Islamic ruling we have to see if they are qualified to give such a ruling do they know the Quran do they have knowledge in Arabic do they speak Arabic do they have knowledge in F and 99 99% we will find that such women are totally ignorant when it comes to the rulings of Islam if you ask them about the beautiful names of Allah the 99 Names of Allah they will probably list five maximum 10 and if you ask them about the then the meaning of these 10 names they would not have the knowledge except in one or two yet they have the audacity to speak speak without knowledge about Islam and to give verdicts whether this is recommended or not recommended when they themselves don't even know the basics of how to purify themselves after mensis or when answering the call of nature this is audacious this is outrageous such people should be sha ashamed of themselves because they're speaking in Islam without knowledge and this is exactly what Allah mentioned in chapter 7 verse 33ah verse number 33 when Allah listed the prohibited acts he concluded with the highest of them all which is to speak about Allah without knowledge so those who dare and say this is halal this is Haram this is recommended and not recommended without the appropriate knowledge or the tools that qualify them to do such things they are talking against Allah and they're placing themselves in a very very dangerous position that would qualify them with uh uh uh um medals to go into Hellfire if they don't show remorse and ask Allah for forgiveness and repent what they're saying is totally wrong and incorrect a person a man as as long as he's financially capable and he can be fair and just and he can divide his time equally between the spouses he marry whether second third or fourth in this case he does not require anyone's permission and he's fulfilling what Allah had made permissible for him and who does not like this can find a big door to walk out of you can find for divorce if you don't want to it's your life but you can't restrain your husband from marrying a second if he's fair and just and has the ability financially to provide for both families or more than that"
