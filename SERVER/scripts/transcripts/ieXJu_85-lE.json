  "transcript": "for Xena says is it okay if I make duaa in my heart without moving my lips before the ephod time or do I have to raise my hands and make duaa with the iftar near me the door has to be engaging your tongue and lips so I cannot keep my lips sealed and recite the Quran or make duaa no I have to make because also I have to say appointment for him and Akio meeting I have to move my lips and my tongue in order for my recitation for my daughter for my secret from whatever I'm worshipping alibi to be valid if I keep my lips sealed and this is a common mistake a lot of the Muslims do so when I start this prayer I say my grade is invalid I didn't say to me at the pub but sure I said it in my mind I said a lot but it doesn't work you have to say whether silently or audibly so when you make dua and their thought is next to you you have to move your lips by by making drug so that it would count and be answered the Shama"
