  "transcript": "Number one, do you think, Sara, that Allah Azza Wa Jal is poor and unable to give you your du'a? Yes or no? No. Okay. Do you think Allah Azza Wa Jal is stingy? He has the ability to answer your du'a, but He's not doing so. No. Okay. So, Alhamdulillah, Allah is the most generous. He gave all this universe what they have, though they're disbelievers. They insult Him, yet He gives them billions of dollars. Look at the richest people on earth. They're disbelievers. Allah is giving them without account, so He's generous. And He has everything in His hand. The whole universe belongs to Him. So when I believe in Allah, when I love Allah, when I know His beautiful names and attributes, and I keep on calling Him, and He's not giving me what I want, then in this case, I have the full conviction in my heart that what I'm asking for either is not good for me, or it's not the right time for me. And this is my belief in Allah Azza Wa Jal."
