  "title": "Doing a sin while the athaan is going on, is this a sin in itself? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Zainab from Pakistan I wanted to ask this \nquestion um I will not go in details but   if one is doing an act act that could \nbe a sin and Athaan is happening at the   same time or one is listening to a meeting \nwhich is Islamic so is it a sin in itself the sin is a sin whether the Athaanis going on \nwhether the Quran is being recited whether the   Sheikh is on YouTube giving a lecture \nthis has nothing to do with your sin   now what doubles or triples the sin if it \nis accompanied by mocking and ridiculing   such rituals so a person is smoking that's sinful \nthat then is being given and he continues to smoke   this has nothing to do with the Athaan and if someone says to him akhi the Athaan \nis being called and he says yes I'm repeating   behind the muazthin then he says yes but you're \nsmoking he said this has nothing to do with Athaan   he said no you're mocking Islam said no I'm not \nmocking Islam I love Islam I love the Athaan   I don't intend any disrespect so \nagain this is from shaytan it has   nothing to do with that or with \nthese rituals and Allah Knows Best"
