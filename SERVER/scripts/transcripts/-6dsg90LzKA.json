  "transcript": "and we have heidi from the emirates hello alhamdulillah yes okay this is the first one i'm talking to you because i'm a newly muslim mashaallah uh i need to know because uh my husband is uh from the other country and i am my father is from azerbaijan okay and i i want to know that my husband he does nothing for me because he said because you are on jobs you just need to take care of yourself everything he does everything for his parents or his family but nothing for me so i i because i don't want to complain about him it's not a complaint i just need to know that how can i deal with him shall i leave him or something i have my own job alhamdulillah i have my job everything alhamdulillah but you know sometimes i need also something from my husband that he buys some small thing for me just to make me happy some small things he does he said i'm very blessed that i'm doing for my parents does he pay for the rent for the food for uh the medical expenses absolutely nothing nothing everything is is there by my company my accommodation my everything so sometimes you take money from me while i'm okay i have no problem with this okay in return i have no idea how to deal with him shall i i don't know what i do i will answer inshallah id says her husband doesn't pay a dime for her well if you are offering charity i don't think you're a charity organization this is not in accordance to the requirements of marriage in marriage it's the man's duty to provide everything for his wife i'm not talking about buying her bags of from louis vuitton or shoes from prada no i'm talking about the norm so providing the food the shelter the medical expenses this is his duty now if she is being offered a housing or an apartment from her work and he comes and visits he should give her what's equivalent to the rent in exchange for that not to get uh to utilize all what she's getting and having this marriage freebie i know any man would wish to go to have a woman who's beautiful and and is rich and providing everything for him he doesn't have to pay a dime but this is unislamic this is not right so it's your mistake with all due respect heidi that you are allowing this how to communicate with him make him man up tell him in islam a man does not allow a woman to provide for him it's my duty it's it goes against my manhood to just sit there and the wife works and she pays for my car she pays for my food she pays for my rent what is this this is not a charity organization so it's your mistake you have to draw the line and consider is he the right person to marry or not and allah knows best"
