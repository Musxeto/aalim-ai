  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh   is it true that Umar -May Allah be pleased with \nhim- said that spending one third of your wealth   on perfume is not wasting money if yes if yes \ncan we actually spend a lot of money on perfume did Umar say that spending money on perfume \nwould not be wasting money I don't know   if this is authentic or not personally \nI don't believe it's authentic   why because everything can be under the \ncategory of extravagance even buying water   some bottles of water you buy for half \na real or one real Saudi riyal that is   sometimes you find bottles of water of 20 \nyears same water hello what is this holy water   said no this is Branch so and so from Switzerland \nor from uh whatever this is extravagance this is   nonsense water is water so perfume yes the Prophet \n-Peace and Blessing upon him- loved perfumes and   he said that there are three things when offered \nto you you should not reject among them is perfume   it's very nice and smell it's very cordial to \noffer to people so it's inappropriate to not   accept it but sometimes you can pay an arm and a \nleg for a small bottle of perfume so would that be   permissible or waste of money or extravagance \nyes it can be waste of money and extravagance   because nothing calls to pay as much for \na bottle of perfume and Allah Knows Best"
