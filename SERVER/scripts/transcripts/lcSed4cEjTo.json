  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the UAE. So my question is, if I'm reading silently, I'm not moving my lips or anything, and I'm reading about the Prophet, maybe the name of the Prophet is mentioned, salallahu alayhi wasalam, do I need to say salallahu alayhi wasalam with my mouth or moving my lips, or I can just, because I'm reading in my mind, I can just continue to read and say it in my mind as well? Inshallah, you can read it in your mind, but I don't think you will be rewarded for it. If you move your lips, you will get the ten good deeds and the angels would mention your name to the Prophet, alayhis salatu wasalam, etc. So, it is best to move it, but if you don't, you're not sinful, inshallah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
