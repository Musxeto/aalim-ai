  "transcript": "Iman from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I was wondering, so I have like around above 200 fasts to make so I heard from like if you don't make it up until Ramadan you're sinful for that but at the same time to make it easier for myself can I make them up in the winter and do that like over a period of years until I've made up all my fasts or does it have to be made up just before Ramadan? Okay so basically speaking someone who has 200 days of missed fasts this means that minimum of 7 to 10 years they've skipped Ramadan either due to pregnancy or breastfeeding or monthly cycle if it is or it was back-to-back they don't have any sin on them so now the kids are settled she's not breastfeeding and she has to make up for these days 200 days are a lot and it's almost impossible to do it in one single year over one shot and nobody says that you have to do this so you try to make them up to the best of your ability and if you manage to fast Mondays and Thursdays of every week and the three white days of every lunar year over the 11 months other than Ramadan you would be able to do 90 days approximately give or take few days which is great if you were to do it over a period of year or two or even three years Are you sinful? No you're not sinful alhamdulillah Allah made it easy for the likes of you to make it up without pressure Do I have to pay and feed a poor person for every day I've missed? It's an issue of dispute some scholars say that you have to others say that it was not mentioned in the Qur'an nor in the authentic Sunnah but it's only from some of the companions who used to recommend it therefore I'm inclined to the second or to the latter opinion which is that you don't have to feed a poor person for every day you miss all what you have to do is make it up and Allah Azzawajal knows best and have you ever taken a counseling session with me? go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah"
