  "transcript": "Hamza from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I got this question once and I just want to justify it as well so I recently got this book called the sealed nectar and I've been trying to find the answer in the book. I couldn't so I don't know what to do. Can you justify why? Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam married Aisha Why not? As such a young age. Come again? Why did the Prophet marry Aisha at such a young age? Why not? What's the problem? I don't understand to be honest because many people say that it's a bit strange and Akhi, Akhi, Akhi, Akhi, you don't Care or give any attention to what others say if you have Unconditional love to the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. If your conviction of the Quran the belief in Islam is Unequivocal there is no doubt in it You should not even listen to dogs when they bark as we don't fall on our hands and knees to bark back Though I've said this so many times. I've explained it in a prolonged Video clip answer. It's on my youtube channel You go and check it and you will find that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam did not marry Aisha except because Allah ordered him to do so and Aisha was engaged before the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam proposed when she was that young and She loved him as she loved no one else and he loved her as he loved no one else Her father and mother were so pleased with it. Everybody in the family were so honored with it There was no one to complain Among the idol worshipers themselves his enemies the Jews the Christians at the time. No one ever said whoa What is this it was the norm This was the normal marrying age only a hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago that this started surfacing For 13 centuries nobody ever complained. It was normal. So don't listen To the dogs when they bark because this is the only thing they found to be dubious in their sick minds and those among the Muslims who have weak iman may be fooled by it and may Listen to them. May Allah protect us all You"
