  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I've just learned recently that it is part of the Sunnah to take a siesta or the midday nap or as it is said in Arabic the Qaylullah because Shaitan or Satan doesn't take a siesta or a midday nap. What I wanted to ask you today was at what time specifically should someone try to take a siesta? Jazakallah Khair. Wa Jazakum. The Qaylullah is a recommended sunnah and to my knowledge that some countries may need them more than others. So hot countries may require this Qaylullah or siesta. Unfortunately some of us may instead of making it a siesta for like five or ten minutes, a super nap as we call them, they go on for hibernation for a couple of hours. This is not a siesta, this is a second night that you're spending. So a siesta, the understanding of it is as follows. The Prophet ï·º and his companions used to wake up before the break of dawn like at four maybe three and then continue to work until after Isha prayer. This long time of working and being active requires some rest and this is where the siesta or this Qaylullah time comes. It should be before Dhuhr prayer or after Dhuhr prayer. It is around this time so it's 11, 11.30 or maybe at 12.30 after Dhuhr prayer depending on your region and it should be like for 15 minutes, half an hour at most and this breaks the tired some that you may feel and energizes you and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
