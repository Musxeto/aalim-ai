  "transcript": "Abu Rayyan from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Ahsanallahu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaykum Barakallahu Fikum Sheikh my question for today is he says instead of so I don't know how okay first of all the utterance of the letters and is very close and the exit and the similar and they resemble one another it's very close so for example the verse in Surat Al Qiyamah wujuhun yawma idhin naadira ila rabbiha naadira naadira and naadira two different words one with a daad which does not have a stick and one was with a dha see dha I take my tongue out dha well the first one is daad dha and the language of Arabic is known as the language of the daad because it's the only language that contains this letter daad so the right way to say it is now a lot and I mean a lot of people in Arabia they say and this to some may be however if I recall correctly in the very beginning of the tafsir of Ibn Kathir he mentioned this fact and said that the utterance of the two letters are resembling one another and it is forgiven and likewise the famous and well-known reciters of the Quran say that this is a fact and some even in the haram may do this quote-unquote mistake because this is how they were brought up and those who listen to it would not say they said a different word rather it's a but there's a it's very close therefore the prayer is valid inshallah and you have no problem with that"
