  "transcript": "Ahmed from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh can you explain what is shirk of obedience and if someone tells me to do a sin and I obey them because I'm afraid that they might make fun of me or think low of me, is this shirk? Akhi, shirk is to associate others with Allah Azza Wa Jal and when my teacher says do this homework and I obey him, when my father says go and get the groceries and I obey him, when my wife tells me to shut up and I obey her, this is not shirk. Shirk is when there is the feeling of reverence, ta'zeem, when there is glorification of Allah Azza Wa Jal or the same to someone else. So I'm not obeying them because they ordered me and I respect them or I fear them or they may put some hardship on me that's why I'm obeying them. Obedience of ibadah, of reverence and worship and humility, when this is found to someone other than Allah then this would be shirk and in 99.9999% of all what goes in your mind of wishwas, it has nothing to do with shirk."
