  "transcript": "sajida from Canada um if I'm out with my parents or in the car with them and they think it is my crew to pray us there when the sun is yellow am I sinful for praying actually when the sun is yellow because it'll be difficult for me to pray um since they're gonna pray at home or later and they're not going to wait for me to you know pray my my son they'll get mad at me I'm like how do I measure a scenario to be necessary where I can bring us through what I'm out with my parents first of all the Hadith like the Hadith be pleased with them stated that the time of assar the time of choice is when the length of an erected object the shade of it is twice the length of the electric object so if it's a meter long and the shade is a twice as long this is where the time of choice ends and this is usually when the sun becomes yellow so Scholars say from the time when the shade is equivalent to the length of the erected object this is the beginning of the time of Asar and the end of time of Asar of choice is when the shade is twice as long as the erected object and this is when the sun becomes yellow and the time of necessity is when the sun is yellow till before it completely sets so in your case if your family is not allowing you this is a time of necessity there's no problem in praying it before the sun sets once you reach your destination and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
