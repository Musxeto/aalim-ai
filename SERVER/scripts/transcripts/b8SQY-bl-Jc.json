  "transcript": "Michael from Kazakhstan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh May Allah bless us all with Fardars Ameen So my question is, what is the best way to give dawah for my family members in my situation? And the situation is, I'm a convert from an Orthodox Christian family. One-tenth of them is very religious. Two-tenths may have some connections with magic and zikr. And the majority of them don't think about God or admire themselves as atheists. First of all, Akhi, this is a long, long, long topic. But in a nutshell, the best form of dawah is to act upon what you know and to walk the talk. So you have to excel in your moral ethics and conduct so that you would stand out in a crowd and people would point and say, this guy is generous, he is courageous, he is kind, he is a cooperative, he is this, he is that. This is all changed after he became a Muslim. This is definitely attributed to his religion. This is point one. Point two, you can engage in dialogue because Allah stated this in the Qur'an. And in Surah Al-Ankabut, the spider, do not debate and argue with the Christians, with the people of the book, except by means of goodness and kindness, unless they are transgressors. So you can do that, but not in public, not in a gathering, because then you will have many enemies against you. You have people ridiculing you, making fun, which would undermine your dawah. Rather, make it one to one. When you visit one of them on their own, you can speak to them softly, give them dawah, show it from the Qur'an, from the Sunnah, from logic, etc. Time after time, inshallah, that would soften their hearts and Allah knows best."
