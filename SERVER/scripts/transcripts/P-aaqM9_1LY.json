  "transcript": "uh from the US how should the IM and his follower Pray when it's only the two of them I've read that it was foot to foot with the follower on the right but many people insist that the IM is slightly ahead to indicate that he is leading could you please clarify this what no this is an act of ignorance of the Imam if the Imam insists on moving a little bit forward when only one person one follower is praying next to him he's ignorant he doesn't have knowledge the Sunnah is that they stand shoulder Tosh shoulder foot to foot as we do usually in the row behind the Imam because when the Imam and the follower are praying together this is the Sunnah not for the Imam to be a little bit ahead of his follower rather they have to be shoulder Tosh shoulder and foot uh to foot and Allah Knows Best"
