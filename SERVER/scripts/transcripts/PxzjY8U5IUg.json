  "title": "Investing Haram Wealth in Halal projects? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Imran says, what's the ruling on investing haram money in halal projects? If a person earned haram money, whether through bribery or selling haram items like cigarettes or issues related to entertainment or intoxicants and the likes, this haram wealth, scholars have disputed whether he has to get rid of it all and regardless if he remains broke or not, or whether he can benefit from it so that he would maintain a decent standard of living. And this is the choice of Ibn Al Qayyim and his Sheikh Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on their souls, that if a person repented and he gathered all of his wealth from selling drugs for example, that's a heinous sin and a crime. But now he's repented. If we were to ask him to throw your mansions and your cars and your cash deposits and everything and be a stone broke flat without a penny, that may not help him to repent or it would cause him to go to do worse things. So the most authentic opinion is that he may keep what maintains a decent standard of living or to be given, he of course he has the money, to take what enables him to have a capital to start a good business, halal business, and inshallah that would be a win-win and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
