  "title": "What is better in Ramadan, to READ or MEMORIZE Quran? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "mustafa from saudi i want to ask you about which is the best of quran recite or to keep the old memorized well this is a good question what's best to recite the quran or to memorize it it depends on the short-term investment and the long-term investment short-term investment is reading it so if i am lazy and if i don't have enough time to devote to memorizing and revising the quran i would recite only one jesus a day so every month i'll finish the whole quran following month the same thing but if i have the energy and the enthusiasm to invest long term then nothing beats memorizing the quran because this would benefit you in the future when you're older this would keep the quran in your heart and it would do wonders for you now in ramadan we have a dilemma because this is a season and the more i read the quran the more reward i get so what should i do this depends on where you find your heart if you find your heart in reciting five or six jesus finishing the quran every five days so be it if you find your heart in revising surat al-baqarah and memorizing it and and and following the imam because you have revised a full jesus or half of jesus so you know what the imam is going to recite and you revise this and work hard on it so be it and allah knows best you"
