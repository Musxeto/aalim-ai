  "transcript": "okay about Yusuf's concerned from Saudi Arabia and this is a very valid concern because unfortunately in the subcontinent in Pakistan India and in Bangladesh and elsewhere they put great deal of emphasis on this Haram practice and that is that when a man proposes there is a lot of financial burden on the girl's family to the extent that they go out of the straight path of Islam and the boy's family demand from the girl's family a dowry which the Hindus practice and the Muslims unfortunately who are Muslim by name still practice it and they say that this is okay no it's not okay at all it is the responsibility of the man to take care of all financial commitments so he is the one who pays for the dowry he's the one who throws the meal of Nakash which is usually this one is to happen after they consummate the marriage but if it happens before or on the night of there's no problem in sha allah he's the one who's responsible for providing for their marital home furnishing put the furnishing furniture in it and all the other expenses this is his responsibility in Islam the father of the girl is not obliged to pay a single dime it's not his responsibility in Islam now having said that there are cultural things so for example if someone proposes to my daughter and they come to write the contract we have here in Jeddah Saudi Arabia we have two things we have what is known as Milka and we have the wedding night Milkha is the marriage contract so at first they come and they propose and the boy sees the girl they like each other the father comes officially proposes to me and I accept he asks me in between each other are there any conditions and we acknowledge whether there is or there isn't how was done okay next week you guys come officially for the marriage ceremony so they come and they write the contract of marriage everything is set now the tradition is that we the family of the bride we throw an invitation that it is small and this is why your cousin when they made the nikah the marriage contract they didn't invite you because usually this is small very limited my siblings maybe my sons-in-law and he brings his siblings and his father it's at uncle's maybe so it's like 20 or 30 people and it's all only for men usually and then we agree on the night of the wedding night which is probably a month to 3 depending so this one is a big night now usually the the the bride the groom there is the boy is the one who takes care of it sometimes he comes to me and said uncle here are like 20 cards invitation for you so I can invite 20 of my friends especially if it's in a hotel or in a big place now my family is big so I say ok tell you what I will take half of the cost on me so that I can bring 150 of my friends and relatives and make it a big night and the bushes ok I'm fair I'm fine with that maybe the boy says listen I can't afford a wedding so I'm not throwing a wedding altogether 3 months from now I'll come and collect my wife and maybe we'll make a walima which is for 10 20 people a very small one in hand Allah a lot of the families no my daughter wants to wear her wedding dress and she wants to be happy this is one night in a lifetime don't worry I'll take care of it now this is not obligatory upon me but I'm offering because I want it so in a nutshell Abu Yussef don't hold a grudge against your cousins it is their right to invite you for one party and not for the other party depending on their financing secondly there is no problem in accepting the invitation for both this is totally permissible inshallah you"
