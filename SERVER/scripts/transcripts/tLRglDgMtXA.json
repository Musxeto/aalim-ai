  "transcript": "Musa from Azerbaijan Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam to Allah Sheikh, I'm having some problems with defecating, while defecating Sometimes I can't get completely empty, therefore I have to push myself to get empty While pushing myself, I notice that I also push myself from the front part And after urinating, I notice that some urine is being left in my canal Because of pushing myself And as I understand, and urine may come out while doing wudu or praying What should I do? Nothing After you finish defecating and pushing yourself You are not responsible for what remains in the passage of your private part Meaning the urine Because if the urine is not coming out naturally And you don't see any urine coming Just overwhelm the whole area with water Sprinkle your underwear and move on"
