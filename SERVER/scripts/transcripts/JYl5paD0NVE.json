  "transcript": "Sheikh I have one question, In Sha Allah. Yes. Okay, so I found some videos about our Sheikh, may Allah preserve him, Sheikh Al-Munajji. Okay. And the videos, they have English subtitles. So is this a good strategy for us non-Arab speakers to learn Arabic or there is a danger on the translation? Just advice, In Sha Allah. Okay. I found a video clip in Arabic, Islamic lectures, and with Arabic subtitles. So is this a good way to learn Arabic? And can this be dangerous? The answer is no. It's totally legit. And most of the material that the subtitles are written in, I was honoured to revise it. So you can, In Sha Allah, trust it, I hope. Because such materials would not be out unless it is revised a number of times. So In Sha Allah, it is mostly authentic to watch and learn from it. However, when it comes to Arabic, you have to understand that not all translations are literal. So sometimes you come to a sentence or a long phrase and you can't translate it word to word. Rather, you have to understand the meaning, rephrase it and put it in a new phrase in the language being translated to, so that the native speaker or the reader would understand it as it's coming in a flowing way, rather than having it puzzling him and not knowing why did they use this word, they should have used that word because it's literal. No, it shouldn't be literal. So if you want to watch and benefit from it, it's In Sha Allah a good thing to do."
