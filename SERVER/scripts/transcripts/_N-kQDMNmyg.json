  "title": "Can I wear Ayatul Kursi as a Necklace? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from South Africa, he says wearing Ayatul\nKursi as a necklace. This is totally prohibited for men and women,\nthis is disrespecting the Ayatul Kursi although you don't believe that it wards off evil but\nyou wear it because you love it or it looks nice etc, this is what you guys call taweez\nand this is not permissible even if you don't believe in it as a taweez. Despite the fact that this is disrespectful\nfor Ayatul kursi, the Quran was not revealed to be worn and you may be in a room that a\nlot of bad and evil sinful things may be taking place, you may forget and go to the toilet\nwith it so the concept of it falling and then you kissing it, this is also another Innovation\nto some scholars, some scholars say it is a form of respect, its best not to do that\nand Allah knows best"
