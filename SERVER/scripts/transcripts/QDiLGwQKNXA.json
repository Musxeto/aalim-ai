  "transcript": "says when we are in the draw for prayer how do we align the row is it by the toes of the feet or by the heels it's an issue of dispute and there isn't a specific hadith that covers and answers this but without any doubt it's the shoulders that should count so even if i have a 46 size foot the shoulders that counts not the toes or the heels so if i put shoulder to shoulder and get as close as possible regardless of the opposition of my foot that would be valid insha allah"
