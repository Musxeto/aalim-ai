  "title": "So many creations, but whom does Allah give Jannahï¼Ÿassim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The Prophet said, Allah is more. You make dua, Allah is more. Do you think Allah Azza Wa Jal needs you or he's poor? How many, and I will conclude by that, how many times did I say this statement? This is the third time. Third is a charm. In Sha Allah, I will conclude with that. How many humans are on earth? Seven billion, give or take. Maybe eight billion. Who provides for each individual? Imagine. Once I was in my high-riser in Kuala Lumpur to attend the conference devoted for da'wah. Anyhow, I was there enjoying my five-star hotel, looking at the people at the rush hour, like ants, in their motorcycles, in their cars, in the hundreds of thousands. And I'm thinking, Ya Allah, each and everyone has a problem, has a debt, has a sick person, has needs, has desires. Allah is giving each and everyone without a doubt. Every single individual on earth Allah is providing for. Only humans? Even the jinn, in their billions. Even the animals. How many animals? In Africa, in Asia, and elsewhere. How many fish underneath the oceans and the rivers? Trillions. How many birds? How many insects? Allah takes care of all of them, but Allah only gives Jannah to you. You want Jannah? Comply with Allah's decree and be satisfied."
