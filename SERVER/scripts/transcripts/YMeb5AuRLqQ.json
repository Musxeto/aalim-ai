  "transcript": "ABD Rahman from the UK he says that his job is to uh um enter data about those who were vaccinated and those who were not and to contact them and to make reservations and some of the brothers oppose this and say that it is Haram first of all it is not Haram and anyone who says it's Haram is speaking without knowledge because he has to speak speak from the Quran the Sunnah and all what these conspiracy theorists talk about is that there's a an electronic chip there is this infertility it causes uh so this is up to you to believe you cannot force people to do this or like that nurse in Germany who vaccinated 8,000 people with salt because she's convinced that it's not permissible and she cheated the people making them think that they're immune when they are not there is nothing wrong in taking the vaccine because it's like any other vaccine you had taken since birth which are a dozen and almost 60% or 70% of the population have taken it I myself have taken both dosages uh from visor like five six months ago early on am I convinced of it or not doesn't matter this is what the system says you want to go for Hajj you want to go for om you want to enter malls you want to travel you have to take it so everybody's taking it why make a fuzz out of it when everybody is being harmed by you as they say the doctors and the professionals and all the scientists say this but you prefer to listen to to a car mechanic who claims that this is a theory that there is a conspiracy and they want to kill us and they want to uh rule the world I personally believe that there is nothing wrong in that can you forge documents helping those who don't want to get the vaccine definitely not you'll be cheating and lying and this is a major sin"
