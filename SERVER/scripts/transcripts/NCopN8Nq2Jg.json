  "transcript": "is running wet fingers between the fingers and the toes obligatory in wouldl this is the Sunnah that this question goes on but I don't have to read it all the Sunnah is when I wash my hands that I put my fingers in between the fingers and when I wish wash my feet I put my fingers in between the toes and why do I do this to ensure that the water reaches the area so this is a highly recommended Sunnah however if a person opens his hands like this I hope the camera gets the short shot so that people would see it if a person opens his fingers like this and he washes it 100% the water is reaching the area in between and the toes the same thing so there is no need if a person skips putting his fingers in his between his fingers and his toes there's no problem none whatsoever and this is an issue of dispute among scholars do I have to rub what I wash or just putting it under the faucet and ensuring that the water reached everything is sufficient the answer is the water is sufficient you don't have to rub it but if you rub it it's an extra plus for you"
