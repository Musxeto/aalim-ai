  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Kashmir Sheikh there are certain \nconditions in Islam where Allah has given us some   relaxations for example like traveling or doing \ntayammum if we don't find water or water is too   cold my question is let's say for example a person \nhas to go to America or China to attend a music   concert hypothetically let's say but he has to \nstay there for two or three days even though   he is sinning so in this situation does these \nrelaxations apply to him for example can he   pray the kasar prayer or let's say hypothetically \na person commits Zina and then he does not find   a water and he does the time so in these cases \neven if he is doing sin does these relaxation   still apply to him the two examples are different \nsomeone who committed Zina this is a major sin   he is now in the major ritual impurity State \ndoesn't have water it's time for prayer that's a   separate thing he has to pray there's no water the \nconcession of offering dry evolution is there for   him he has to take it this is separate someone \nwho's traveling with the intention of sinning   the majority of Scholars say that he may not \ntake Allah's concessions of traveling because   he's traveling is not permissible so if I'm \ngoing to a country to fornicate and to party   and while going there I'd like to take the \nconcessions of travel a traveler and prays   and combined between Assad Etc no this is \nnot permissible because the initial purpose   of your travel is Haram and hence this \nis not permissible and Allah Knows Best foreign"
