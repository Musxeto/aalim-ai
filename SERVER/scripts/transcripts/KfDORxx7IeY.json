  "transcript": "uh Dima from Germany I have a very organ IC so um my grandpa used to not pray in the past and we know that like if a person does not pray at all he is counted as a kaffir but now he prays alhamdulillah but my mother doesn't know whether um when my when her when my grandfather who's her father she doesn't remember whether he was praying at the time where she got married to my father or not so I'm worried because a cafe cannot count as a as a Welly of a woman so I'm worried whether their marriage is valid and whether I'm attributed to my father now what is this is this a joke Dima now you are cascading things that are way above your pay grade and this indicates a grave error in the way people think so my grandfather did not used to pray but now he prays alhamdulillah so we know that he is a kafir no you don't who labeled him as a kaffir ah Sheikh I heard somewhere on the web I don't I don't know maybe Islam q a maybe Islam web that would not who does not praise the kafir we said a gazillion times that this ruling is theoretical I don't come to brother Ahmed who's my neighbor or colleague at work and cascaded on him by observing him and says hmm I haven't seen him pray for two weeks he's a kafir boom labeled him stamped this is not Islamic so now one number one you cascaded the ruling on your grandfather without any Witnesses without any interrogation without asking him without having a Muslim judge condemning him after interrogating him that he's a kafir this is error number one error number two now you want to Cascade this ruling on him being a Wali to your mom when she married your father so you want to invalidate their marriage which is cascaded on the other points such as number three you're not the legitimate child of your father which means that your father cannot hug you or kiss you because yet he is your biological father islamically he you are born out of wedlock which means that if he dies you will not inherit him you have to take hijab from him and if someone wants to marry you he cannot be your guardian what is this and this is the same mindset that generates unfortunately don't get this personal I'm not talking about Dima personally I'm talking about a trend among the Muslims this is the same mindset that generates that generates Isis or nicest non-islamic state of Iraq and Syria that generates people who give the fear and are prone to blow up places and people because of their Twisted mindset had they learned Islam properly and I'm again not addressing you Dima don't get me wrong I'm just giving an advice for the ummah because this is something that is obviously growing among the youth they pick up a word or a statement from a Sheikh and they Cascade lots of scenarios and they act upon it without going back to the Sheikh himself and if they went to the Sheikh that probably he would have scolded them for their approach and the way of thinking so definitely all what you have mentioned in your question is bogus and baseless and you have to erase it from your memory and move on you and your mother as well [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
