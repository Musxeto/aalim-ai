  "title": "Can I pray Salatul Shukr Everyday to Thank Allah for Blessings",
  "transcript": "um zainab says can i praise salah to sukur every day to thank allah for the immense blessings that he bestowed on me and my family the vast majority of scholars say that salatu also is not based in islam there are some scholars that accepted it and said that it is permissible based on weak hadiths and based on a hadith that are not related to sugar prayer rather it is related to duha prayer so the vast majority of scholars the vast majority of scholars say in islam what is proven is frustration of gratitude and this was done by the prophet saw whenever a blessing occurred and he wanted to show his gratitude to allah so when the muslims were victorious in a certain place he falls down and prostrate one prostration of gratitude if you have an uncle who's undergoing a serious surgery and a life-threatening surgery and you were told that he alhamdulillah made it you make this sujud but when your wife cooks a good meal you don't do this when your team or you yourself score a goal you don't do this because this is an ongoing process when your boss gives you your paycheck at the end of the month you don't do this so in short salah to sugar is also not something that is related to islam and it's not authentic to do you"
