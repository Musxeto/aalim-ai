  "transcript": "Aisha from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, my parents, they always keep fighting. They have argument every month. So, my dad does not understand about period. So, he keeps ordering my mom to do things and when she says no, he still keeps telling her that don't give excuses and do it. Even if they have an argument, they don't talk for 5 to 7 days. So, what should my dad do, Sheikh? This is something that both of them need counseling. Definitely, they have a problem in the field of communication and in the field of respect and also in the field of knowing each one's rights and obligations. So, they need to have counseling with a Muslim counselor who would listen to both of them and correct them and show them what to do."
