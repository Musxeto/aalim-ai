  "transcript": "Ewan is from Holland we know that mocking Islam takes you out of the fort of Islam but what counts as most mocking Islam people when making jokes don't want to mock Islam but they use elements of Islam to make people laugh does it count as smoking Islam definitely definitely any joke of Islam takes a person out of the fold of Islam Allah says in chapter 9 is [Music] Allah says and if you were to ask them they would say we were just fooling around Allah says say to them is it by Allah his signs or his verses and his messenger you mock around and fool around do not apologize you have left the fold of Islam you have committed cover after being a Believers so any joke about Islam about Quran about Allah about the prophet saws any making fun of the rituals of Islam immediately takes a person out of the fold of Islam"
