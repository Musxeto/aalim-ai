  "transcript": "so the topic of the day is the rights for the spouse and this is a very important topic for everyone to listen whether they are married not married or are going to get [Music] and before we start our program can anyone please put their phone on so without wasting any time this topic is extremely important but unfortunately the time is limited i did something around the topic of the spouses and marriage in islam which took me about 16 hours in a workshop called half deen hd or you can call it high definition but it stands for half dean in chennai india and it was mashallah a good event that i have benefited a lot from unfortunately we are limited in time and we would like to go through as quickly as possible to benefit from the time that we in just looking at the tip of the iceberg now those who are interested in getting married insha'allah enlightening but those who are currently married would find it a bit disappointing [Music] see i do counseling and when i sit with the man complaining about his wife and i listen to him i say your wife should be executed and when she comes in tells me about him i say your husband should be standing in front of firing squad and when they sit together with me half of what they had said is gone like butter at night it's solid when the day time comes it melts so everyone is not a victim is a perpetrator everyone because when we tell our side of the story we tend to show that we are the victims she did this to me she did that to me and i said yo allah i feel you man and when she comes and complains i said where is your man i want to beat him but we have to fear allah azzawajal because yes i can win when i debate with you i can overtalk you i can have more logic and beautiful sayings when you are unable to express yourself but who knows the truth first of all we have to understand that marriage is not what do i have in this marriage for myself it is not something about the most important thing is for you to look at marriage as a favor and blessing from allah azzawajal those who have been married for 10 20 years say what blessing and what favor i'm just doing time i just want my freedom well then what should i say when i'm 36 years now married alhamdulillah and i'm still walking i don't know how but alhamdulillah if i show you my head you will see high heels traces from my wives masha allah seriously allah azza mentioned marriage in the quran what did allah say allah says and of his signs is that he created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them and he placed between you affection and see indeed in that are signs for the people who give thought subhan allah this is what allah says about marriage so marriage is a blessing from allah azzawajal but you need to acknowledge this in the beginning otherwise you would see it as a menace so now if i tell you how many blessings of allah do you have said oh maybe one of two what i have a car but it's not working very good i have a job but i'm thinking of much better job with pay that's it what about your eyesight what about your health what about your children what about your parents who are well what about the security you're enjoying here in this country uh yeah that that also you don't recognize allah's favors this is why allah's favors are easily taken out from you because when you're not thankful allah will take it why would allah keep his grace upon you if you're not grateful and thankful so you have to acknowledge number one that you are in aniyama a favor a blessing from allah azzawajal now when it comes to right of the spouse this is problematic if you go into a marriage only thinking that it is rights and obligations your marriage is not going to last long if you think that this is what marriage is i have rights she has to give to me she has rights my obligations towards her that's it is this marriage then you have a problem marriage is much much higher than this so first of all before going into rights and obligations there are common rights between man and a woman these common rights are shared between them so first of all they both have rights allah says in the quran and allah says and due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them according to what is reasonable but the men have a degree over them this is what allah says so they both have rights but the men have a higher degree which means that the responsibility upon the women in order to deal with their men is much greater than the responsibility of men to treat with their wives and we will come to mention this insha allah down the line so what are the common grounds between the rights of spouses first they have to cooperate with one another in advising one another and reminding one another of allah azzawajal so it is not the responsibility of the man woman wear hijab woman go and pray woman fix my nasi goren and and sadi this is not your part she has to also advise you why don't you go to pray in the masjid why aren't you giving your zakat money every year why don't you go and see your mother and father this is your obligation my duty as a wife is to remind you go and call your father and mother and your kinship and be kind to them and we have so many stories that we can cover but the time is very limited the prophet says may allah have mercy over a man waking up in the middle of the night then waking up his wife if she refuses sprinkles water in her face and she wakes up and they pray night prayer together and may allah have mercy on a woman who wakes up in the middle of the night and wakes her husband up if he refuses she sprinkles water in his face and he not a bucket of water huh sprinkle just little with love with compassion he doesn't want to get divorced it's too early so this is what on what on building a house on buying a new car on saving money on akira they have to remind one another of allah remain steadfast protect yourselves and your families from hellfire so this is something that is joined between them secondly in marriage there has to be a manifestation of mercy tranquility compassion love each one of them must show the other it's not as we usually say no no no men they have hard hearts they fail in expressing their feelings when was the last time you took your mobile as a husband and wrote to your wife i love you i miss you it's been a long time and she replies to you are you crazy you just left home half an hour ago what's wrong with you are you getting married to a second wife come on confess no no no this it doesn't go like this whenever i say such things i usually i'm the first to do it so immediately after it's finished i take my mobile and i send my wife a love message and it has a great impact because men are stiff by nate you know women they mashallah they don't hate each other but they talk and they talk about their personal things you know my husband did this my husband did that my father-in-law did this my mother-in-law did they talk about personal things men no it's taboo we can sit together how what's the latest model of the car you saw what about the football game and what about buying real estate uh mortgage this never talk about their personal things this is how men are made it is something that has to be shared by both men and women expressing their compassion imagine the prophet ali by allah i know when you're mad with me and when you are pleased what is this is mad with the prophet so she says how is that o prophet of allah he says when you're mad with me you say no"
