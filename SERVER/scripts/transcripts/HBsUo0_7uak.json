  "title": "Mispronunciation leads me to repeat verses over & over, & it takes 30 mins to pray, what to do?",
  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I'm struggling with pronunciation during Salat. I do well in reciting or repeating after recording outside of prayer, but during prayer my mind blurs and sometimes I don't know if I recited was correct or not. And this causes me to think that I pronounce things incorrectly and makes me repeat phrases constantly. And this issue affects all parts of Salat, making it take up to 30 minutes. So after praying, I review the Arabic letters and sometimes discover that my mispronunciations change the meaning. And I don't know that it does well in the moment because I don't know Arabic words, but afterwards I look it up and end up finding out, which leads me to pray all over again. And this cycle of stress and worry repeats for each prayer time. And during Salat, I have a tendency to start feeling physically ill because of it. So I know I can pronounce things correctly and I try to get it right by repeating. And I would just ignore to move on and not repeat, but I feel like my mispronunciations are too incorrect for me to just brush off. So what should I do? Brush it off. Very, very simple. You've reached level four or five, which is just about to be broken by Shaytan. So Shaytan wants to break you. And you've reached a level where he has marinated you over a long period of time. Now you're ready because you've been listening to him repeatedly and answering all of his queries and doubts. And now you've reached a breaking point where actually you're contemplating on, this is not working. This religion is not fit for me. I'm not going to go into this. This is causing me physical harm and mental harm. So I might as well quit Salat. And this is what happens with a lot of the apostates. May Allah protect you and me. What to do? Nothing. Allah Azza wa Jal is the most merciful, the most forgiving, the most compassionate, the kind, the one who guides people to repent and accept their repentance. He's not a tyrant. He doesn't, he's not waiting for you to slip and then or trip and throw you in hell. He knows your ability. Take it easy and try your level best and move on. Allah would not hold you accountable as long as you did your best. Repeating verses and phrases in the Salat is not your best. This is adhering to the whispers of Shaytan. You've done your best outside of the prayer when you're reciting with the reciters and rectifying your recitation. Everything is beautiful. The moment you start to pray, he messes up with your head. And there is a Shaytan designated for this. His name is Khinzab, the Prophet told us, as there is another Shaytan designated to mess up with our heads when we come to issues of purity His name is Al-Walhan. So don't listen to him. Allah says in the Quran, fear Allah to the best of your ability. And by what you're doing, you're doing it beautifully. Don't repeat verses. Don't check whether you said it right or wrong because this is how Shaytan is going to mess up with your head. Salat should not take more than 10 minutes in average. Can be a little bit less, a little bit longer. That's it. Not because of repeating it, but rather because you're praying it normally and correctly. So don't go into Shaytan's trap holes."
