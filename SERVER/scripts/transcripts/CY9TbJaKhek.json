  "transcript": "Muhammad from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh I heard the interpretation of a good dream we get comes true so we shouldn't tell about our dreams to anyone My question is if someone make a mistake and said his good dream to someone and get a bad interpretation Is the interpretation bound to come true or it can be changed by Allah if the person make dua No it is not going to come true with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal Because the interpretation of the hadith is an issue of dispute among scholars Whoever sees a good dream he should not tell it except to those who love him Because the interpretation would coincide with the Qadar of Allah Azza Wa Jal This is mainly so in most occasions like 95% You will not tell your good dreams except to those who love you And in these 95% those who love you will interpret it in a good way And in these 95% they interpret it in a good way It will coincide with the divine decree of Allah and it will happen as they've interpreted it The 5% who chose to go against the norm and interpreted it in a bad way This will not happen as Allah Azza Wa Jal decreed it before because it's not according to what Allah has decreed And Allah knows best"
