  "transcript": "[Music] if the prophet sallallaahu assalam and the Companions prayed p.m. at home and not in the Masjid then why Masjid in the Arab countries host Gemara prayer that is congregation prayer for p.m. isn't that counters as a bidder first of all let us understand the math what is p.m. what is that are we what is the Hajj or what is Witter these are terminologies that I'm confused of don't be this is why I'm here 'i'm will a known as night prayer or salah too late this is a big umbrella and this big umbrella underneath it folds any prayer you pray after isha and before the break of dawn the Adana Fechter so anything you pray in between is considered to be night prayer hmm interesting what about Tara we're taraweeh is specifically night prayer offered during the month of Ramadan haha so if I pray during the month of Shaban this is not prayer if I pray during Hajj this is night prayer Tara we specifically refers to night prayer done in the month of Ramadan interesting hundred what is the hundred the hundred is night prayer the only difference is that the majority of scholars say that the head jute has to be preceded by sleeping so if I pray after Isha at nine o'clock for three hours is this the head Judd they said no this is night prayer but if I sleep after Isha for an hour or five hours and then I wake up before the break of dawn and I pray for an hour for a half for three hours for four hours is this the hatchet excellent why because to wake up after sleeping is far difficult than to pray without sleeping so I'm already awake it's 10 o'clock it's 11 o'clock I'm still fit to go and make wood oh and pray there's no much effort needed but when you sleep for three hours and it's your cozy bed air condition is cold and it's dark everybody's asleep you wake up and say huh let me pray a night prayer let me pray 200 Shaitaan is whispering and he said come on come on night is long sleep and wake up after an hour or two and you go back to sleep you wake up only after fajar it's difficult it needs guts it needs a strong will supported by allah azzawajal for you to wake up and pray this is why the HUD jute is far more difficult than regular night prayer hmm okay then what is Whittle with her in Arabic means odd so one is with her three is with her five is with her seven is with her and so on but usually it refers to a single raka or three rockets because this was the habit of the Prophet Allah so - Salam who said night prayer are in twos to offer Salam to offer Salam to offer Salaam and then the Prophet says I some if you fear the break of dawn then conclude this with one single Raqqa which is Witter so the total would be 11 or 21 or 51 or 55 50 cent whatever number it's odd because you've added one single raka to the even numbers of rakahs prayed earlier so this is Witten and if you understand all of this you will understand that the Prophet himself alayhi salatu was-salam offered Tarawera we've mentioned this earlier he prayed three or four nights leading the companions in congregation in Ramadan then he stopped but he continued to pray the whole night in the last 10 nights of ramadan and this is why in the arab world as you referred the muslims pray the first 20 nights in taraweeh when the last 10 nights enter they would increase the paste and put it in high gear so that their Hamada there were forms of worship would be increased so in addition to the taraweeh they offer p.m. which are connected there's no problem in having a gap in between them where people would go and eat or have a good night's sleep and come back to conclude it with p.m. al a which is known as as well as the head root this is not a problem in it's not Abaddon in sha Allah [Music] you [Applause]"
