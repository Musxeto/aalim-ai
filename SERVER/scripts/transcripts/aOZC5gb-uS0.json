  "transcript": "Wasim says that the rocky that made Rukia to my grandmother said that she has magic her hand has too much pain during the night and the doctors here in Algeria and in Europe do not know what is going on I want to learn how to read Quran to her on her hand do I put my hand on hers and I read or without this or how should I do proper rupiah for her please clarify first of all let it be known through my programs lectures and answers I always say that is part of the RPD of a delusional jamar which we all abide by we believe in the existence of black magic we believe in the existence of jinn possession we believe in the existence of envy and on evil eye all of this was mentioned in the Quran and the authentication of the Prophet as some we have to put the ground rules before we answer this question so we all agree that this is true and a reality however I have problems with people who try to justify their failures in life with such things and I've repeated this so many times someone who has a nagging wife he says that she is possessed with jinn his son fails in exams he said this is evil I his boss does not promote him or deprives him from the race he says this is black magic his car does this or its envy people are envious of me and this is not that the case and hence people should not blame everything that happens in their lives to these things secondly brother Waseem says we took her to our play and he says she has magic and so many times I get questions similar to this saying that the rock is that he or she has black magic done to them by their uncle masha'Allah or they have evil eye given to them by their relative in Kuwait and I asked them okay if I take my car to the mechanic he hooks it up to a computer and he can tell by the analysis what is the problem with the engine does the arathi do something similar to that how would the Rakhi know that it was done by so-and-so unless he's a liar or as he's a soothsayer it is with jinn so I have my reservations yes some rocky's who are trustworthy say that there are signs that differs between someone with black magic and someone would evil eye but still this is not something that was revealed to us something that is divine or part of the Sunnah it is personal HT hat that might be right might be wrong thirdly what to do when I want to make croupier because some people say do I put my hand over the head of the person I'd like to make repair for or do I just recite the Quran what's the procedure again we have to go back to the Quran the sanam and mainly to the sooner the prophet alayhi salatu salam as narrated by mother aisha may allah be pleased with her whenever he used to go to bed he used to blow and then recite the last three holes of the Quran and then wipe whatever he can from his body but if he felt pain in his body now this is the night coat and coat rupiah or bed at car but the actual rope here whenever he felt pain in his body he used to recite the three holes then blow not the opposite and then he wipes over it when he was sick at the end of his life mother aisha said i used to gather his own hands read in them the three holes blow and wipe his body with his own hands which means that mm no he says the actual blowing is part of the rakia so whether you blow on your grandmother by reciting al-fatiha idol could see the last two ayahs of surah al-baqarah and the last three pulls and you dry blow on her or you do that on your hand and wipe on her this is hella this is okay there's no problem in that insha'Allah but you have to be present I've heard of some rakhis who are performing rakia long distance and that's mighty fine to me he's in the states and the people are in India and he goes alhamdulillah I mean he blows in his head phone or his handset and sometimes they go into conference call so UK Korea and India in the same call what is this this doesn't work at all this is totally bogus and it does not work"
