  "title": "Does the Crescent Moon and Star have any basis in Islam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Monier says the crescent moon and the star which some people consider to be the Islamic symbol does it actually have any basis in Islam the short answer is no it has no trace or relationship or roots in Islam some people came up with it to match the David the start of David to match the cross which the Christians have and the Muslims at that error said we don't have anything to show as a symbol so they came up with the crescent and they came up with the star and this has nothing to do with Islam so relating it to Islam considered it to be part of Islam hanging it on merits or hanging it on flags this has nothing to do with Islam"
