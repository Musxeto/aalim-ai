  "transcript": "Abdul Malik from [Music] France uh my friend told me that during the domination of the Ottoman Empire Balan had to pay huge tax jazia I think the word is so my question is how much Jia is for the non-muslim I heard is between 2.5 or 5% I don't understand your question correctly but gizia is a form of Taxation that is imposed upon those who are non-muslims yet living on Muslims territory and lands and it's quite a small amount of money where they get to live and Taxation is being taken all over the world it is in some cases less than the the zakat that we Muslims are obliged to pay and it's only mandatory upon those who are considered to be capable of working so um women children and the likes are not obliged to pay jizya only capable men who are at the working age are those who are considered to be um supposed to pay the jizya the percentage I don't actually know it but it is mentioned in the books of F and Allah Knows Best"
