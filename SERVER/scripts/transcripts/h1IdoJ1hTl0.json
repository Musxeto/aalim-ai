  "title": "Is it Haram to go to school or work on Eid",
  "transcript": "uh the uk in the uk they have a limitation of the amount of days we can do it so there's so they eat i celebrate their age because of course it would be haram for me as a muslim consideration with the quran or not to celebrate my aid with the muslim but what about can i go to school on those days and then come home and celebrate with my family or do i have to stay home and celebrate with my family first of all as a muslim living in a kafir country there are many things that we have to adopt and not to think that we still live in a muslim country among these things that would be friday prayers for someone who works and everyone works on a friday and they'd refuse to give you a day off you can you cannot simply say i'm not gonna work and start begging people so one has to adapt to what's happening in accordance to the sharia law when it comes to read there is no enforcement of not to work on the day of eight and it's not the sabbath that we should sit home do nothing it's a day of jubilation it's a day of happiness it's a day of celebration and this does not mean that you don't work you can work and there's no restriction in islam none whatsoever to working on the day of aid or to going to your school if you need to the only restriction is that you must not fast on that day and that is about it you"
