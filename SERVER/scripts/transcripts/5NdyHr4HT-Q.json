  "transcript": "of abandoning the quran is abandoning pondering upon it contemplating on the beautiful meanings that it includes not being able to succeed in understanding what allah wants from us so yes we may read the quran we may recite it but we are short of going the extra mile reading the tafsir understanding what allah wants from us through it and implementing it in our lives imagine if you as an individual managed to devote half of your time not all of it no let's be fair just devote half of your time even 25 of your time that you spend on social media on reading newspapers on watching the news on watching netflix or haram showtime programs etc rubbish if you devote 25 so if you spend eight hours just spend two hours of these eight hours reading the quran pondering upon it checking the meanings in the books of tafsir how would our lives be if we managed to do this we wouldn't be"
