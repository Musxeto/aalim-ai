  "title": "Am I Sinful for cutting the beard a fist length? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Idrees from Holland, the Netherlands. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh I have a question, is a person sinful if he cuts his beard up to a fist length like Ibn Umar may Allah be pleased with him? may Allah be pleased with them were reported to have this understanding that the beard can be shortened if you do this and you cut whatever exceeds a fist length. So, whoa, I have a lot, I can, I can, I have credit, I can do that. Why don't you do it Sheikh? It looks nicer. Yeah, it can look nicer but as there is an issue of dispute and there are two opinions and both have grounds for what they're saying. So, Sheikh Ibn Baz and Ibn Uthaymeen and my whole posse of scholars that I follow say it's not permissible. Why? Okay, I respect this, I follow this. So, we have two strong opinions. Now, if I come on the Day of Judgment not taking anything from my beard, would Allah, Azza wa Jal, blame me for that? No. Okay, but if I come on the Day of Judgment shortening my beard to a fist length, would it be a probability that Allah would blame me for that? Yep. So, what is the safest? To leave it. And this is what I'm doing and this is what I'm inclined to say, but I wouldn't say it's sinful. And Allah knows best."
