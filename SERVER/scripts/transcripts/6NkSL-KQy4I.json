  "transcript": "i sha says can my brother through breastfeeding be my welly if my father dies and if I don't have any blood brothers and does he inherit my parents first of all the team or the prohibition of breastfeeding or suckling is only in marriage and nothing else so if my wife circles a child and the child's grows and everybody knows that he is my son out of suckling or breastfeeding when I die he doesn't inherit and he cannot be a guardian to my daughters because he's and he's not a blood brother he's not a real brother so for you Ayesha yes the brother through breastfeeding cannot be a guardian for you and he does not inherit your parents or you the prophets told the Sallisaw some that the Muslim ruler or the judge would take the place of a guardian for a woman who does not have a guardian so in your case if your parents are dead you have no siblings then it is your paternal uncles they are your Guardians if you have no paternal uncles then your paternal cousins they are your Guardians because they carry your name if you have none and you're cut from a tree as we say in Arabic in this case you go to the Muslim court or to the Islamic centre the authorized Islamic Center and the Imam would become your guardian and a large surgeon knows best"
