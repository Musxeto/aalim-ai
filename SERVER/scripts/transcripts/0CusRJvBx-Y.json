  "title": "The Three Fundamental Principles (Thalaathat ul Usool) | Part 2 | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "like him has to provide like him and has to give you guidance like him and no one in this universe can do that not even a clothes and beer angel nor a close and dear messenger this is why Allah the Almighty may forgive all types of sins it's up to his divine will you can be a murderer and Allah forgives that a man killed a hundred soul and sought Redemption and forgiveness and Allah forgive I forgave him you can commit all heinous acts and still Allah forgives that except  except associating others with Allah except disbelieving in Allah and his attributes if one does this and dies doing this allah azza wajal would never ever admit him to Jenna and he would be admitted to Hellfire without any chance of leaving that the evidences are overwhelming allah azza wajal says that the mess sheets the mosques are for allah alone so invoke not anyone along with allah and this clearly indicates that allah azza wajal does not advocate does not permit people to associate others with him and the Prophet said Allah has taught wa sallam said in an authentic hadith whoever meets allah azza wajal and he does not associate others with him he will be admitted to Paradise and whoever associate others with allah azza wajal he would be thrown into hell may Allah al protect us all okay now said whoever obeys the messenger that is mohammed sallallahu wasallam and singled out Allah in worship it is not permissible for him to take as allies those who oppose Allah and His Messenger not even if they are close relatives ok this is an issue known as al voila well bara which is a very essential and important issue in Islam what is al wala well bara Allah is allegiance to take someone and to give him your allegiance so if he needs help or protection you provide that for him this is al wala and as oh Allah is the ally of the believers and the believers men and women are a lie one to the other so the issue of allegiance is extremely important as important as distancing yourself from the disbelievers which is known as al bara you have to announce that we are not like the disbelievers and they are not like us and this is extremely important to understand and to know from the religion of Islam so many people because of their ignorance they think that Islam is just simply praying and fasting Ramadan and that's it we can be like them we can dress like them we can talk like them while in the Quran in the prophets hadith sallallahu alaihi wasallam you would find that this is something that cannot be accepted and it is part of the essence of the Deen so you must not take those people close to you even if they were your relatives what is the ayah no sir now the proof is you will not find any people who believe in Allah and the last day making friendship with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers all die kindred for such he is he has written faith in their in their heart and strengthened them with the roar light and guidance from himself and he will admit them into the gardens underneath which rivers flow to dwell therein forever Allah is pleased with them and they with him the other part they are the party of Allah verily it is the party of Allah that will be the successful very good this ayah is in Surat al Majid Allah the last I of certain mu J Dilla now the translation is not accurate you Muhammad will not find any people who believe in Allah and the last day making friendship this is not an accurate translation of the word where Allah says that as you do home and your men honorable Allah you are doing them and had the lower solar width is not something that is prohibited width is a sort of a friendship with conditions now what we are not allowed to take that non-muslims as allies as confidence as close people to us more than the Muslims and the ayah is crystal clear even if these people were to be your fathers sons brothers and your kindred as long as they poses them and there are enemies of Islam and this is what you understand from the word had allaha wa rasuluh those who oppose Allah not any person who does not want to believe so yes we there are non-muslims who don't want to believe in Allah or in the prophet or in the day of judgment but they are not enemies of Islam their kind to Muslims they respect Islam they never insult Islam such people's we can't take them as friends not close allies not confidence but their acquaintances we say good morning to them in the morning we send them food in Ramadan as a gift we congratulate them when it is our eighth not their festivals because this is not permissible if they were blessed with a child we congratulate them there's nothing wrong in that in Islam at all what is wrong is to take those who oppose Allah and the messenger Ali system as friends and this is the third matter which is extremely important which is a so clear in the Quran and so clear in the Sunna that a lot of the people due to their ignorance and lack of knowledge don't know of it now I know that the people of Nigeria have strong Eman but through Twitter I've also found out that a lot of them are ignorant maybe they would come publicly and say statements that would be very difficult for for them to retract off they would say things that children know as Basics in Islam and this is no no losers not logical how can Islam say this this is fabrication this is this and they installed in their humilate and they read a cure something that is from part of the basics of Islam so I know people now would listen to my talk and say oh this is causing disunity ah he don't mixed apples with oranges nobody is making disunity this is the religion of Allah so Allah tells us in black and white we must not take them as allies they're not Muslims but Islam doesn't tell us to cut their throats this doesn't tell us to spit in their faces when they see them this is not how the Prophet used to deal with them the Prophet used to deal with them with a lot of dignity and honor meaning he would not bow his head to them never now we see the Muslims kissing their boots let alone bowing to them so Islam tells you be kind to them but at the same time preserve your honor and the dignity of Islam so you should not be violent you should not be rude or abusive when they come to you be kind to them as long as they do not oppose Islam and Allah and the messenger and the day of judgment now listen to this ayah in Surat al muntaha verse number 4 chapter number 60 you can read it yourself later on for 60 Allah says there has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibrahim and those with him okay Allah is telling us the Lingam - the RAM it says the recording has stopped no sir you you guys still can't hear me okay then I will continue Sharla so Allah Azza WA JAL is addressing muhammad salallahu alaihe salam and giving him an example to follow Allah says there has already been for you an excellent pattern in AB Rahim and those with him when they said to their people the Brahimi's people said to their own people indeed we are disassociated we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah okay so this disassociation is part of Allah we're telling you we are not alike you are from our people we have the same nationality we speak the same language but you have a different faith so we disassociate it with any other thing that you worship other than Allah what's next they say we have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone what a strong message to be said this is a declaration of faith this is what we believe we're not gonna beat around the bush we believe in allah azzawajal if you want to share our belief you are more than welcome we become brothers and sisters but if you refuse in this case we have to part our ways because you have your own religion and we have our own religion okay are you back doesn't matter okay now we're going to know that me I'm not grant you the ability to obey Him that Abu Hanifah the regional Ibrahim is that you worship Allah alone making the religion sincere that is solely for him these can retreat the second page no may Allah grant you the ability to obey Him that al hanifa the religion of unbroken al-hadith iya now Hannah Thea by the way has nothing to do with Abu Hanifah the Imam hanifa Leah is to tell and not to be straight that's strange because we thought that Islam was always all being straight yes to be tilted deviated from the way of shirk this is why it's called al-hadi fear to some hat this is the religion of Islam since the time of Adam till the time of Muhammad SAW Allah Allahu Allah may Allah be pleased peace and blessings be upon them all so it is tilted and this usually refers to the religion of the brahim the father of all messengers so the Sheikh the Imam says acknowledge may Allah guide you to obey him that al Hanafy this pure r√°pida is the religion of ibrahim okay then what is the religion of Ibraheem the Imam says hmm that you worship Allah alone making the religion sincerely for him this is what Allah ordered all of mankind to do and this okay so so what is if someone says to you what is the Hanafi diya what is the religion of Ibraheem what is the religion of all messengers of Allah the answer is very simple it is to worship Allah alone sincerely in sincerity in Arabic is Allah floss do you know a chapter in the Quran by the name of surat al-ikhlas no sir yes which is full elderliness no the one before that by touch alone pull who Allah this is called surah - plus the chapter of sincerity what what sincerity say Allah is one Allah who summit the one that all people go to or direct their prayers to for asking him for their needs merely do an amulet he's not be getting begotten and does not beget well amir khalaf one and no one is like him soprano time this is called a little ass so to worship allah azza wa jal it's not just to pray and fast and do these rituals wishes pillars of Islam you will not be accepted until you have sincerity in your heart sincerity in forms of worship one says sure I'm a friend of a brother Ibrahim because he has a beautiful car I'm not saying if so I will be in hell no this is not a worship its it might be sinful you might be using him but this is not a breach of sincerity which will admit you to Hellfire we're talking about sincerity of your robada of your worship why are you fasting because of Ramadan no I've gained weight so everybody's fasting so I'm joining them so that I would lose weight so it's not for Allah no I don't think so why are you praying I haven't seen you pray in the masjid for ages said my boss is joining us for prayer so I wanted him to see me pray next to him so the Philippine marriage is a breach of sincerity that is unacceptable none whatsoever so the religion of Ibraheem dependent on worshiping allah azza wajal sit with sincerity and this is what allah has instructed all of humanity not only that this is what why Allah created all of humanity yes of him now Allah says when my father children no aliens alarum boon and I did not create gene and mankind except to worship me okay to worship me what does this mean this mean is to single me out and worship so Allah created the jinn and the ends so that they can worship Him now some of them did worship him others did not worship him so they disobeyed Allah Azza WA JAL was Allah subhana WA Ta'ala unable to force them out of Allah of course he was able to force them but he gave them the choice and Allah gave the choice to all humans whether to worship Him or to disbelief to disbelieve and end up in Hell fire so the choice is yours and this is the meaning of worshipping allah azza wajal that is to single him out in worship and this is why we have to know with a meaning of tau heat so heat has three meanings meaning number one or three branches three types there is no heat aloo bhujia there is no heat and hulu here and there is no heat an asthma was so fat chef we don't speak Arabic can you please translate okay wait why are you rushing we have all day long this is almost four hours for if part don't fresh things and beside this is free so I'm not charging you for it at hand except from Allah so though heat number one is that the heat of Lord ship what do you mean by tell Heat no heat is to single Allah out with which no one can share with him okay singling Allah out with one what no one else can share with him can you elaborate I will inshallah number one the head of lordship how do we single Allah out in his lordship first of all we have to acknowledge as we stated before that Allah is the creator okay this is easy and that Allah is the sustainer he provides us with all what we need definitely and that Allah is the owner and these are powerful words doesn't seem powerful for Misha he created us he sustains us he owns us no it is powerful because if you contemplate upon it being the owner I can do whatever I want with what I own so if I take my mobile and I toss it against the wall to break into pieces which is mine no one can say why did you do this I'll report you to the police alas dojin has no one to be reported to to he's the supreme subhana Allah if he were to take all of humanity all of this universe all of the jinn and the angels and whatever he created and throw them into hell not a single person or soul could object to that because he owns you and he has the power to do whatever he wants with you so when you acknowledge his lordship that no one creates but him no one provides but him no one sustains but him and that he's the owner and that he is the giver of life and he's the taker of life he's the one who facilitates our affairs I can go from point A to point B without his permission and planning and enabling me to do so so this is the head of Lordship no one has argued about distillate even idol worshippers when you ask them who created the heavens and the earth the idol worshipers would stay on long who brings rain from the heavens they wouldn't say Idol number one or Buddha or our cow they would say Allah who created you Allah who made this world possible to live on Allah everything you will find this so many times repeated in the Quran so this is the head of Lordship the second type of dough heat is that Oh hate that wars were initiated to protect the blood was shed because of their defiance and not willing to accept and that is that the heat of worship so we single out a lot so agile in worshipping him we pray only to Allah we seek forgiveness only from Allah we fast only to Allah we sacrifice and offer sacrifices only to Allah soldier when we seek refuge we seek refuge in Allah and when we supplicate and invoke we supplicate and invoke only Allah this division of though he is what the idol worshipers fought against and they said Subhan Allah didn't say that this is from me and they said had he that is Muhammed made all the gods one that we don't worship except one this is something weird so this type of to hate is what most of our Dawa revolves around because the vast majority of people are believers in allah in his existence in his powers to create to own to sustain to provide to give life and to take but when it comes to devoting sincerely underline coat bold and make it and red flashing sincerely worshipping allah azzawajal this is where all the disputes between the messengers of allah and the enemies of these messengers of allah took place because of number three is the head of allah azza wajal in his beautiful names and attributes so we don't call allah and we do not describe allah except with what he himself called and destroyed himself or his messenger called and described him the almighty allah so john why because these names then attributes cannot be something that is figured out by your intellect it has to be a revelation we did not see Allah Azza WA JAL so we cannot talk about him without proper evidence that is backed by Quran and Sunnah even the companions may allah be pleased with them don't have the authority to describe allah or to give names to allah if it were not backed by the quran and by the sunnah yes of he the greater esteem that Allah commanded is tawheed which means singling out Allah in worship and the greatest thing that allowed one against is sheer pushes supplicating to others other than him and the proof for this is elastic it's meant what I would allow her whether to be Shia and what she Allah alone and do not mix anything in worship with him and if he has said to you what are the three fundamental principles the mankind is okay let us let us know so let us stop here so the evidence is crystal clear the cardinal sin as they call it in in in cattle ISM which is associating others with silk this is something that allah azza wajal does not accept or forgive so all what you study and learn from al-qaeda is one who your Lord is to what your religion is free who your messenger sallallaahu Salim is and what did he teach you if you combine all these three and implement them and there your life you will find that you have become a proper Muslim and that a bada of allah azza wajal is according to what pleases allah and you're bound to hit paradise with the grace of allah azza wajal now I think we should stop here if you guys don't mind because we will be beginning a new chapter and we would like to devote more time for that so what do you say is just massive should we go to the questions yes yes sure sure I shall now read the question out for you now it so the first question is a sheikh my mother he is a patient suffering from you will you Ranieri bladder cancer now she has a new pathway for uranium which higher in pushed back to a bag and not through natural pathway she wants to know if her bag comes full of urine and when she drains that urine is how will do broken or and to make a new Vudu okay click after shake to pray for her first of all I pray to allah azzawajal the almighty the creator of the heavens and the earth the one that holds everything in his hands to cure your mother and to make this something that erases her sins the previous and upcoming and to grant her the patience and the content to be content with whatever Allah as those of decrees upon her Allah is most hearing and most seen secondly what your mother is suffering from this was described by the scholars of someone who has your urinary incontinence and incontinence means that urine comes out without being able to control it so what is to be done scholars say for people who are similar to your mother's case that this is beyond your control and due to the issue whenever it becomes so tight Islam widens it up and now it's very hard and tight so how does in slam treat this well scholars say that if it is time for lore and the van is called for the horn and you empty this back you wash the areas afflicted by urine a new performer you can pray the cur you can pray sooner you can brace the Hara you can read the massage you can do anything you want until the time of Awesome Jeff I can see you're in coming out no problem your rudeness is still intact once the answer time is do you want to pray answer you have to renew the process and perform Moodle and you can go on until sunset once the Sun sets you have to perform Moodle and you can remain in this voodoo as long as you do not difficut or pass went or do things other than things dealing with urine this is only big of the urine coming out issue but if you break your rule with other means then your wood breaks so you Premal rape your prisoner you can do whatever you wish until it is time for Asia you can perform Moodle pressure until midnight and then you have to perform another would all if you want to pray a night prayer and you go on like this without any problem well hamdulillahi rabbil alameen this is shared by anyone who has urine incontinence or someone who has ste haba so she's getting brownish yellowish discharge though she is pure from her menses so she acts exactly the same fashion as mentioned before or someone who has a problem with passing went 24/7 the same goes for him or her and Allah knows best all right shake these questions say that you spoke about bin since he had totally to Allah it is is it permissible to record videos and show to the public when we are doing charity because the donation will receive up from public I don't understand the question is it okay for her to you know when you go for charity to make videos and make picture the name public because the public actually give them the money okay I believe that we doing poor people or people in need and using their footage to draw money from the rich and make them feel sorry for how poor they are that this is degrading and humiliating allah tested me with poverty I am in need I am a poor Muslim but this doesn't mean that it's allowed for you to go and do what whether you want to do with my picture and my footage like that this is Hara so some people say okay what about if we take that permission of course they will give you their permission because they want your money so it's like forcing them to concede to accept when they are in deep need of it this is not fair it's not fair for people to go and shoot for example in Syria houses that are burnt or destroyed and and poor people outside who've lost their loved ones crying and weeping and we video that just to show them the atrocities that are taking place these people have honor and dignity and we should not do this or use that and Allah knows best I think the next question is it possible to make heaven if you don't believe no you you don't another hit Islam if you believe your way of life is religion itself your kind you're good you're a nice to people you don't do wrong things you don't hurt people but you don't have a specific religion how would a larger this is a kafir there's no dispute in that the Prophet said Elizabeth Salam in an authentic hadith he who hears about me and does not follow me he will be in hell forever and would not be admitted to channel so no matter how nice you are how kind how polite how generous to the poor if you don't believe in Quran if you don't believe in prayers if you don't believe in the Sharia and implement it you're doomed to hell it doesn't matter how good you are to the people if you're not good to your Creator and without submitting your will to Allah you have the arrogance that Satan had Satan was among the ranks of the Angels when Allah created Adam he told them all to prostrate they all prostrated except Satan so Allah says Satan why didn't you prostrate to what I had created with my own two hands Satan said I'm better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay so he was arrogant he did not submit his will to Allah and the result was that he's thrown in hell - he turn 80 and every single person who shares the same conviction and belief would share the same fate mashanda I said how do I deal please how to do a Muslim answer the question from an atheist who created Allah well this is illogical because if there was someone to create Allah he would not qualify to be a god a god that is created cannot be a god because part of the description of God that he does not that he is not created he's one of a kind he's the first without a beginning he's the last without an end this is the definition of God so his question is not relevant it's not logical because if there were someone who created God then that someone would be God himself then we would go into the loop then who created God then who created the woman who created God then who created the one who created the one who created God all of this is nonsense God is one subhanahu wa'ta'ala is not created he's not begotten and he does not beget and there is nothing like him subhanahu wa'ta'ala qui Shaykh there is a house with the owner buried within the compound about 15 years ago the house is about to be sold please what can we do with the grave it cannot be sold a house that has the grave of a Muslim buried in it cannot be sold and this is why it is wrong for a Muslim to instruct his family to be buried in his home because now this becomes a sacred land that is sacred because of a Muslims corpse inside of it the only way I see it out for them is that they approach the Islamic court and they try to get a order from that court to remove the grave to be taken into the cemeteries of the Muslims so that they can sell that land and this cannot only be done by a judge a Muslim judge directive yeah if a person dies on Friday what are the facilities that he will get or she will get the Prophet told told us are a missile at us and whoever dies during the daytime of Friday or the night time of Friday when is the night time of Friday a chef Nasir night I'm afraid yes Thursday night correct so the night time of the day in Islam is the night that precedes it that comes before it and this is cascaded throughout the whole year and this is why Thursday night we started praying taraweeh though Thursday was the 30th or the 29th of the month and the first day of Ramadan was Friday but the night in Islam precedes the day except in one case and that is on RF at the day of artifact once the Sun sets the night is also called the night of artifact when we go to Muzdalifah but this is not our topic so what is our topic if a person dies Thursday night or during the daytime of Friday the Prophet gave us the glad tidings alayhi salatu wassalam that he will be exempted from the torment of the grave and this is a glad tiding because this means that this person has a good ending yet we have to be careful that not to jump into conclusions so people say oh if he's not being tormented in his grave then he will be admitted to Paradise directly and I says no this does not mean that he would not pay for his sins in Hellfire on the day of judgment it simply means that Allah exempted him from the punishment and the torment of the grave on the day of judgement it depends how good or bad he was and he would be held accountable accordingly and Allah knows best none about donation I accidentally donated 250 pounds to Islamic Relief and I have an issue because I want to cancel it but at the same time since is Ramadan I shouldn't cancel the payment even though my intention wasn't to pay 250 pounds and it was my mistake what should i do what should i do will I get for what for not cancelling the money even though it was a mistake if you did not cancel it it means that you are approving it and it will you be rewarded for that if you cancelled it this is your right nobody says that you have to go ahead with that mistake which you did not intend and you will be centrally if you retract it no there's nothing wrong in going back in it and putting that I wanted it only to donate 25 not 250 there's no problem none can one eat food in which a Christian mentioned blood of Jesus on it before serving or when one is eaten together is same bismillah at my end sufficient to interpret what counts about the food whether it's halal or Haram is the slaughtering so if we're talking about vegetables and fruit and some Christian says in the name of the blood of Christ or a Buddhist said in the name of Buddha or a Hindu says in the name of Krishna and they present us the food we say bismillah and eat because whatever they had said does not impact the fruit or the vegetables or the candies or whatever no problem eat if I have meat so someone is serving steak and they say bismillah or they say in the name of Jesus or they say in the name of Krishna and they serve it that does not impact the meat what impacts the permissibility or the prohibition of consuming that meat is how it was slaughtered so if someone while slaughtering the sheep says bismillah Allah WA and it what is it this is halal meat if someone says bismillah Allahu Akbar and he stabs the sheep in the stomach or guts it out while alive or bangs it with a hammer in the head or suffocates it until it dies or Electrify it until it dies all of this is called dead meat though he said bismillah Allahu Akbar because it was not slaughtered so the two reasons or the two conditions for a meat to be Highland one you have to mention the name of Allah - you have to slaughter it three the person slaughtering it has to be a Muslim Jew or Christian any other religion is unacceptable now the Christians slaughter and they bring us the food but we don't know what they had mentioned whether it's the name of Jesus or the name of Allah it doesn't matter the default is it is Haddad unless proven otherwise so coming back again to your question someone presents me with food I look is this food veg or non-veg if it is vegetables fruits candies cakes whatever bread it doesn't matter that what they mentioned the name of they mentioned in the name of Jin shayateen the food itself is halal I can save a smell and eat it if it is non-veg it's an animal I'll have to look into the animal is it pork it's Haram by default is it lions is it monkeys as it dogs cats Allah harem by default no it is beef or camel or mutton sheep okay then I have to look into the origin of it who's presenting it to me it's a Christian or a Jew they're slaughtering is hard for me I can eat it's a Muslim I can eat it is some other religion I have to refrain I have to investigate how it was slaughtered once I am assured that it is Islamically proper I can then eat and Allah knows best and I'm sure someone asks is it okay by perform ablution naked if people are not looking no problem I guess ablution has nothing to do whether you are fully covered or totally naked evolution is washing your hands your face your arms wiping over your head and washing your feet it doesn't matter with whether you are clothed or not so to answer your question it is totally permissible I was once employed by a company as a software engineer to build apps for them one up I walked one was similar to GoFundMe where anyone can financially contribute to people's need it was during the building that it was doing the building the app that I got to know that the total money contributed can have interest on it although I no longer work with them was a salary I ain't doing the time Haram and and do I have to be paid back after paid him back so I did not understand the point with the interest yeah yeah I think he opened an application like GoFundMe but he now realized that there is interest attached to it so what kind of interest he didn't specify maybe he can specify okay generally speaking an app that is both used in Hara and Haram as long as you don't know what is going to be used in salah as long as you did not know that they will charge interest or give interest or it would have any involvement in interest you just built a wallet for them there's nothing wrong in that it's like saying share I used to sell house she ten cents and I sold someone a knife and he killed someone with that knife am i sinful and there's my money and income Haram dances no when you sold him the knife did you know that he was going to use it in Haram there's no his knives only used in Haram no the generally speaking it's only mostly used in halal cutting meat cutting bread using it to eat cutting vegetables in this case there's nothing on you in Sharma masha'Allah Sheikh is it permissible in Islam to have the intention of the total number of children one wants to have meaning limiting it you're like now I would say okay I want to just have four children haha after flexure I don't have much children no this is not as per the sooner the Prophet said daddy his salat WA Salam tanaka who ten a salute hawala do get married reproduced have children for I will boast the nations with my own followers on the day of judgment so the Prophet would boast against other messengers telling them look my followers are more than your followers so the Prophet instructed us to have children and only those secularists or those affected by their ideas would say no no no this is wrong it's best to have good quality than quantity to have two or three children and raise them well better than to have 15 and they're all scum and burden on the Syria society and the community this is nonsense there are so many couples I know that have only one child and this child is the most evil and deviant child ever they tried everything and nothing worked well not only that no peace be upon him tried everything with his son and his son drowned in the flood refusing to go with his father on the ark why because guidance in the hand of Allah it's not in yours and mine I know a lot of people who have a dozen or more of children and they're all righteous practicing masha'Allah a coolness to the eyes I know one of the shoe here in Saudi he's over 70 years of age he has so many children two of them are PhD holders and they are Diaries themselves are very well known that is in Saudi when you are a scholar and you find your children being scholars or being productive or being positive elements of the community this is excellent so limiting the number of children saying ok 3 is enough that's crap let's call it her rap and that's it cut all tubes and and and whatever is needed to reproduce no this is not permissible that's Hara know yet when praise Allah wish you are expected to recite aloud for you mister Clarice I silently or vice versa what shall you do does it require so yourself first of all should you do so who is only required if you make a mistake with a mandatory act or a pillar mandatory act such as saying subhana wa birra americorps subhana wa bil allah institute saying allah talked about will you move from one place to the other saying semi allahu liman hamidah arab banana kind Han sitting in the first a Shahu saying it here to really let the first one all of these are mandatory acts if you make a mistake if you did not say it if you put it as somewhere else you have to perform so yourself pillars are like reciting the Fatiha standing up for prayer doing record doing sujod sitting between the two sister doing the last shot saying Allah Akbar in the beginning and saying as Salam aleikum o Allah in the end these are pillars if you make a mistake in them you have to rectify it in the same prayer and and offer it and then pray sujood or offers you the sell things that are voluntary are Sunnah they do not require sutra the sell whether you do them by mistake or intention for example I am standing to pray I say Allah Akbar sure you didn't raise your hands yeah I know Oh chef this is not permissible pray offer to stress yourself no this is Sunnah saying Allahu Akbar in the beginning is the pillar so if I don't raise my hands I'm not sinful in Lahore reciting the fat behind the first two rakahs is Sunnah silently the Fatiha itself is a pillar but reciting it silently is this one if someone comes into the Masjid and this happened so many times the imam comes to lead the lahore he said Allah ho Akbar and his mind is somewhere else what somewhere else al-hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen and everybody is behind him this is lore what is he doing so then subhanAllah subhanAllah and then he wakes up he continues the prayer normally is he obliged to pray or offer to soothe yourself no in mother the MM comes Allah and he decides to Fatima silently and the people are waiting with what is he doing we're waiting to hear the Quran he says Allah Akbar he goes for record no problem the prayer is totally valid and there is no such itself for that I hope his trance is your question now shake Ike will fast last Ramadan as I was pregnant I couldn't pay it back as I am breastfeeding now I remember pregnant no no she was pregnant then you have to say that in the beginning and you don't get me confused having second thoughts okay so a woman saying that she was red didn't fast last Ramadan as she was pregnant she couldn't pay it back because she's breastfeeding now and Ramadan is here surely she said do I need to do Vidya for the last Ramadan but I didn't pay back just like Allah said there is no Vidya the most authentic opinion among scholars is that there is no figure for a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding so this means that a woman who heard my previous two answers and she said to her husband okay the chef says we have to continue bringing children and she brings children breast feeds them then gets pregnant again breast feeds them and gets pregnant again for ten five ten years so she comes to says check 30 days by 15 these are 450 days to make up do I have to pay any expiration or feeding in the food nothing once the obstacles are gone you have to make up for these missed days to your convenience we don't tell you for 50 days custom in a row no fast every Monday every Thursday the white days day on day off depending on your ability and you can make it a pitch Allah with a year or two or three maximum but there is no sin on you and saying that you have to reproduce does not mean that you do not plan I didn't say that you get pregnant you circle you get pregnant nine months later on well still suckling your child and have them on top of each other no you get pregnant you give birth take a year and a half off so that you can breastfeed the child grows well once the child is a year and a half or so you can get pregnant again so your body is more relaxed and you've regained your strength and you can live no one said that you have to have them all in a row yes I'm sure this question is a please check I need more clarification in the question about making a video of help in a burnable one because what was asked what if the money is from the public meaning the video is for each donor to see where this donation went okay it doesn't matter whether it is from people that those who were filmed do not know about or not the issue is with the human dignity with the honor of those who were videoed so if I were to tell you I'd like to videotape you when you are sick and dying or you are on your bed sick and suffering so that we can get donations for this or for that would you allow it most people say no I don't allow people to take me when I'm weak and vulnerable and use such footage so this is what counts Allah knows listen this is my opinion by the way ricochet Kazama reckon I cannot fast due to medical condition but I often feel guilty I know it is a test from Allah hard way to how do I deal with this guilt this medical condition my friend is either chronic which means that the doctors say you will never ever recover from and this would remain with you to the end of your life or they would say that inshallah a couple years three years will be fit to fast again if it's the latter then there is no problem in you skipping the fasting days until you recover like the sister who was pregnant or suckling and then you can make it up when there are no obstacles for you to make them up but if you're the first which is a chronic illness like dialysis something to do with blood pressure or with diabetes that if you don't eat every couple of hours you would faint and probably die in this case this is chronic in this case yes you don't fast but you feed after every day a enough food for one poor person so if you delay it until the end of the month and you feed thirty persons that would be sufficient by giving each one 1.125 kilogram of rice or you just simply cook a lot of good food and invite 30 poor people to eat from it now the next question is if you make the intentionally memorizing the Quran on you and working towards it on you attack we get there would have been Hafez did not get that if you memorize the Quran if you're on the verge of wanting to memorize the Quran and you pass away do you die as a half if you get the water in a harvest no you tried but you did not die as a half of and you will be rewarded for your intention and when you ask such questions it gives me the impression that you have the ability to say okay if I'm not gonna die as a half of I'm not gonna die today die another day this is something in other stands Allah rewards us for our intentions but definitely those who memorize the Quran and they memorize it fully Allah Azza WA JAL would make their level in paradise at the last ayah they recited and memorized so sharp Mahdi he will be treated well she should know he should not fear any injustice from Allah the Almighty as sahaja M can one collect money from someone whom you know is it his source of income is Haram as a gift basically his source of income is Haram but loves to give charity even to the Masjid and the needy people also he is not a Muslim but gives charity to everyone regardless money or Haram money is either Haram for itself or Haram for the way it is earned money that is Haram for itself is either stolen or taken by force this money you cannot utilize it if given to you as a gift you must not accept it and it's Haram for you if you take it even as charity we cannot take it so if someone comes to me and says sure this is not service car I'd like to give it for Dawa and he says okay where's Nasir works non-citizen Nigeria is in Cano and I stole it from him I cannot accept that there is another way of Haram money which is haram for the way being earned so a prostitute makes money the money itself is haram not because of itself rather because of the way it was earned someone who sells drugs or has a bar and sells alcohol the money he earns is haram according to it the way it was earned someone who deals with RIBA and he lands people money and he gets RIBA the Haram money is how long because of its the way of it it was earned it is haram upon the person who earns it once he gives it to anyone else it becomes how halal to everyone else so if he gives me a gift I accept it if he gives a donation to the Masjid we will accept it because the Haram money is how onto its way of earning not due to its nature and Allah knows best sure come my wife correct my recitation when she is praying behind me during an obligatory prayer or thoroughiy secondly if I make mistake my prayer like Miss America how can she call my attention to she says on Allah or Club Homs the scholars say that if a woman is praying with her Muharram and there is other nun Muharram she must not speak she just claps to bring his attention to this mistake but if she is praying with other Muharram other women and their all her Muharram mail she can correct him by raising her voice likewise if he makes a mistake she has Liberty to say subhanallah like men who usually do or to clap either way is permissible because why not saying Subhan Allah is permissible for her he's the reason is not there anymore there are no than Muharram for her to clap so she can say subhanAllah without any problem ok my shot automatically just to take few question they were in for today's Allah how many just so that I can adjust my timing okay that's true Charla I have no problem going no so sure how can I get over Shaitaan make me feel good when people see me doing would act even if my initial intention is is good I feel it is real should I just make it stick for her and Allah will accept or are my good deeds oh my deeds food because I felt good so most I did gonna be terrible because I felt good I had while it to the road first of all if you were to ask me about my CV I would probably give you 2 to 3 pages and I have worked in many positions that have many training courses in the corporate world of course not in the Islamic world but in companies and you would think that mashallah Hassan is well versed in public relations and human resources this is my specialty but if we were to ask Satan to give you her his CV it would be in the hundreds of thousands of pages because his experience ranges from the time of Adam peace be upon him till the current date so he knows exactly what makes you tick if he sees that you're careful about religious commitment he would go to extremes washing your arms three times is not enough make it give it a fourth time just to be safe so instead of making wudu in three minutes you end up making wudu in half an hour and every day you add another minute or two then he comes and says why make wouldl if you're not sure that you've washed the organs properly nickel for every salon and he remains and continues to harden things for you because you opened the door for him until he makes you abandon salat altogether leave salat leave Dean and this is what I do counseling for I do a lot of counseling sessions with people who are almost having OCD and they are going a bit towards insanity we give them such eyeopener's like this and with the grace of Allah social they are well again or the other side there are people who are not religiously committed so he goes to them and say why wash your arms to begin with half of the arm is enough fee this area did is not wash since ok Allah for Ibrahim I was most forgiving after you prayed I saw three lockers did I yes ok Allah ok I have to pray the fourth no no no no Allah will accept that and he indulges in fitna indulges in sins mixing with women drinking people watching movies listening to music until they leave so a lot totally and become liberals secularists whatever you call them so now you come and always ask yourself I did something good it was for the sake of Allah people are praising me well should I do ok who I hear you do you mind asking me who's talking to me who's telling me this who's giving me advice about whether I did something good or not it whether it was sincere or not is it an angel or Satan you will immediately answer yourself by saying no this is Satan if it's Satan don't the center I am giving a lecture on zoom' about a soul ethel otha I get people sending me messages Seussical Ohio and very beneficial we have learned so much of you I love you for the sake of Allah blah blah blah my head is getting bigger and bigger and bigger like a balloon boom it explodes I tell myself before going tonight to bed at night hmm praising people is good I feel good when they praised me when they say that we've benefited from you you have changed my life I feel so fulfilled am i doing it for the sake of a Laura not maybe I'm not maybe I'm doing RIA I'm showing off I like people to praise me why aren't they saying that he is the share the scholar the knowledgeable the dish is that why people are not kissing my head or forehead when they meet me they're not respecting me I'm not doing this for the sake of Allah I'm doing it for fame I'm doing it for being renowned among the people when I get these thoughts I sit in my bed not literally but figure out what you're saying my friend but can you please identify yourself are you an angel or you are you a Shaitaan I don't get a reply because he does not identify himself sometimes I'm sitting and I get these whispers you have four hours of no commitment why don't you go where your aha make Umrah just say I hear what you're saying my friend but can you please identify yourself are you an angel or a Shaitaan I would definitely get the answer back even if he doesn't answer I will answer myself no this is an angel no doubt about it he's telling me to do something good so I he when you get these whispers of Shaitaan and you know that they are from Shaitaan his only objective is to make you stop doing good things and if you do stop doing good things you become one of his soldiers so whenever he comes to you tell him hahaha I know who you are I'm going to double it next time just to make you unhappy and angry and you keep on doing good things for the sake of Allah knowing that no one knows you no matter how many people praise you on earth and say so many good things about you only you know yourself better than anyone else so even if you say shall pass him you're a righteous person you're a a kind person you are masha'Allah a scholar of all scholars I know myself so who you fooling no matter what you say I know that I'm not a scholar and this is why I keep on repeating I am NOT a scholar we're just students of knowledge collectors of knowledge from authentic places here and there Allah only blessed me to be famous because I come on TV channels and because I speak a little bit of English that allows me to explain like any teacher would analyze a journalist push a mathematical logic is a time already
