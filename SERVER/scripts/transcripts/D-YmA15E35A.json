  "title": "Elastic band around wrists on Abaya sleeves? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam to Allah. So my question is if an abaya has an elastic band at the wrist and the elastic band is approximately like three centimeters long, is that abaya, is my arm still covered? I don't know. What you have to do is cover your wrist and whatever is under, up your wrist. So if you expose this area, no, your salat is not valid. This is your wrist, this is what you cover. Whatever is above that has to be covered. So I hope this answers your question and you must be careful not to go into OCD. So it's not an issue of millimeters and centimeters and bringing an auditing company to check whether your prayer is valid or not. Be normal and try your level best to cover your hands without even an elastic band. Just try to wear your sleeves up to your wrist. If something exposed and you see it, you simply pull it down and that does the job inshallah."
