  "title": "She wants a divorce, but her father insists on independence or returning to her husband, leave BOTH?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, I have had a difficult marriage in the past 10 years and now I have decided to get separated. My dad agreed initially but as I am not independent at the moment he wants me to either get independent or go back to my husband. I used to work earlier and gave every single penny to my dad and now I have no savings or investments. I am actively looking for a job but my dad keeps on abusing me. Is it ok for me to leave my house and my father? Do what? If you don't want to go to your husband and if you don't have a job and if you don't want to stay in your father's house, excuse me, what are you going to do? Work as a prostitute? Anywhere? Be logical. Either you stay in your husband's house, tolerate his abuse and be a decent wife or trash him and ditch him and force yourself upon your father without working and tolerate his abuse but to go and live elsewhere. Where? With what income? And who would take you in? This is not logical. Some women are impulsive. They take decisions, they shoot and then they ask questions. And they say, Oh Walla Sheikh, what should I do? Now you ask, ask before you make such a decision so that you know what your options are. And this is why it is important to consult elders, people of wisdom in your family, people of experience and to make istikhara before making any decision, not the opposite. So you have a choice. Stay with your husband. I can't Sheikh. In this case, file for divorce without the approval and the help of your father. And once you're divorced, force yourself upon your father. He will not kick you out of the house. And if he does, then you've done your due diligence. Because if you stay with your husband without fulfilling his rights, the angels curse you every day until fajr. And Allah knows best."
