  "title": "Being late for Isha & the Imam already started Taraweeh, what to do | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay Abu Yussef says that if a person comes to the harem and to any other Masjid and he finds that the congregation is on but this individual did not pray his Asia prayer but he is not sure whether this is Asia or taraweeh what is the right thing to do the answer is simple that I think to do for you is to enter with them regardless whether they're praying Asia or taraweeh your intention is for taraweeh for Asia so if they were praying Russia so be it hand Allah a win-win situation if they were praying taraweeh once the Imam offers Salam from his second raka you would know that this was tell away so you stand up and continue whatever is remaining for you in salat so if you have three records remaining you offer it if you have two then you offer to and then after concluding your Asia you will join them insha'Allah in the remaining of tell away"
