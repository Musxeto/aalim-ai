  "title": "Dawah: How do we give Dawah? (Basics Part 4) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "we're still discussing the basics in our religion and among the basics in islam is to call and invite others to islam and we talked in the previous two episodes something about this topic and we were hoping insha'allah to conclude talking about this today and this is the third episode of calling to allah azza so how do we make da'wah as i said it's not one size that fits all there are different ways it depends my dawah to atheists is different than maidawa to uh other religions christians jews etc my dawah to the intellectuals it might be different than maidawa to laymen and people of simple knowledge so it depends on the situation the circumstances and the one i am addressing however thirteen years that the prophet alaihis salaam had spent in mecca giving dawah he did not teach people rules of or of sharia or legislations he addressed main topics that would make the foundation for a strong islam this foundation this particular foundation that he had established resulted in a generation that humanity had never witnessed and this is the muhajireen those who migrated from makkah to abyssinia and from mecca to medina they proved themselves alongside with their brothers al-ansar the people of medina they proved themselves when the tough got going for example in the battle of hunain when the prophet haslam conquest mecca and 2 000 of the inhabitants of mecca accepted islam so an army of 10 to 12 000 soldiers marched to the city of taif where the tribe of and hawazin were there and while they were on their way unaware they were ambushed and the moment they were ambushed the whole army retreated and fled out of fear only the prophet alaihis salatu along with seven or eight individuals remained facing this ambush and the whole army of that city funny thing is the prophet islam had so much trust in allah that he went to battle on his mule he didn't go on his camel because usually in such battles where you have to engage with the enemy you usually either take your camel or your horse as a right in order to support you in your fight but a mule but this shows you how much trust the prophet so all the companions retreated and fled but the prophet remained as islam along a handful of companions fighting off defending the prophet the prophet ordered the abbas and abbas had a very loud voice to call upon the people and he specifically ordered him to call the muhajireen those who migrated from makkah to medina who stayed with the prophet hassam all these 13 years and then migrated with him to medina al-ansar and those who gave the pledge of allegiance to die underneath the tree and that was in the covenant of al-hudabiyah when the prophet came on the sixth year of hijrah sallallahu to perform umrah and he was blocked from completing it and they had a treaty and they signed the treaty so they had the pledge of allegiance to die in order to go and save uthman in afan who was sent as an envoy to makkah but was delayed because of their hospitality the the prophet assam and his companions thought that he was killed and assassinated when abbas called these people the moment they heard these titles they turned 180 degrees and came shouting here we are o prophet of allah and in matter of minutes everything changed and the muslims won that battle took hundreds and thousands of prisoners of war and took a lot of camels and cows and sheep and all of what that enemy army had gotten with them out of their ignorance thinking that this would prevent the people from fleeing the war so they ordered the women and the children and to take all of their wealth with them so that when they are at war they would fear to abandon and to flee the war in order not to risk losing their wealth and their families not knowing that when death is lurking you don't think about anything except saving your own neck the point is that the prophet isalam set the foundation for a strong iman what did he do throughout these 13 years he gave dawa based on what based on a number of factors unlike what we do you see lots of us give dawah by being defensive so we start to defend what the enemies of islam criticize it of and that's not the right way of doing dawah yes it's one aspect it's one part of it someone comes to me and says sheikh why islam is so and so and so i have to have an answer in most cases i have answers but to devote my time and dawah solely for the purpose of why islam permits men to marry for why do women have to wear the hijab why do we have prescribed punishment in islam why do men get double the amount females get in inheritance why this why that i would be wasting a lot of time without setting the foundation because you will always find something to criticize if you fail to set the foundation what is the foundation allah stated in the quran say o people of the book come to a common term between us and you that we should not worship other than allah so this is the foundation that we should establish first before anything else why if you don't believe in islam if you don't believe in the existence of allah if you have doubts about allah azzawajal no matter what i say or quote from the quran or from the prophetic sunnah of the prophet salam no matter what evidences i give to you your logic would still say no no this is not logical so imagine if someone is interested interested in islam and he starts asking these questions why is wearing gold prohibited for men and it's permissible for women what would i say to this this person because it is uh it gives the looks of feminism to a man and this is not masculine and it says okay what's the ruling on wearing diamonds for men diamonds are okay diamonds are forever says this is more feminine i said i never thought of that this is wrong this is not how you make da'wah when you tell people about fasting so someone comes to say why do muslims fast you say because islam wants the muslims to feel how the poor feel when they don't have food or a water and non-muslim would say duh this is not logical i could buy food and give it to them why would i starve and if i live in a country where daytime is eight hours or five hours and nighttime is 17 or i wouldn't feel hungry or thirsty so is my fast is invalid this doesn't make any sense and it doesn't make any sense this is why we have to set the foundation what is the foundation sheikh to worship allah alone do you know what the prophet assalam focused most on in these 13 years until hate what is the definition of tawheed tahit is divided into three types to heed of lordship to heed of worship to of beautiful names and attributes of allah we will not go into these details but maybe we will devote a an episode for it as this is among the main basics in islam but tawheed revolved around two main pillars which the prophet alaihis hassan focused upon his dawah in mecca and elsewhere number one to dissimate disseminate to disseminate all that is related to idols or entities worshiped other than allah so anything that does not possess benefit for you and cannot harm you and cannot give you life or death and cannot resurrect anything that does not listen or comprehend or feel such gods are not worthy of being worshiped so we have to explain to the people that all of this is void is nothing can't be worshipped can be taken as gods and this is the first half of the statement there is no god worthy of being worshiped this is what the prophet used to do and this hadith is graded weak by al-bani but it has a lot of value to it al hussain is the father of hussain the well-known companion the prophet asked him a very straightforward question how many lords do you worship and he said seven one in heavens and six on earth so the prophet haslam asked him who do you call when you want benefit or want to be protected from harm he said the one in the heavens who makes the rainfall he said the one in the heavens when you have something who do you ask he said the one in the heavens so is it possible that you worship and thank and express your gratitude to other than him and share with him these six who don't have anything to do or offer to you look at this logic this logic can be used anywhere you can use it with those who when you ask them how many gods do you have they don't know one of them says the last i counted was 60 thousand sixty thousand gods what do you worship said everything mice uh cows idols um statues portraits anything that can be worshipped we worship ask them this specific question who do you call when you are in need and they will all say the one in the heavens because this is going back to our first episode islam the religion of nature the religion of fitra this is the fitra that allah has created this upon to worship only one god and that is him so this is part one the prophet islam used to disseminate anything related to god's worship other than allah and this was easy to prove it's not rocket science the prophet just opened their eyes out of islam and they could see clearly the second part is to make them worship that there is no other god deity worthy of being worshipped but allah so cancel all gods and only worship the one true god who's worthy of being worshiped and that is allah and that is also easy to prove to them that he's the creator that he's a facilitator that he's a sustainer that he's the giver of life and death all of these things are with him the third aspect is to engage them in the concept of resurrection and life after death and the day of judgment because this was one of the main issues they did not believe in how is it possible when we are turned into dust when our bones are gone that we are resurrected and the quran speaks about this in a very logical and easy way to understand even for nomads and bedouins the one who created you from nothing it's easier in our calculations and logic to resurrect you from something wouldn't that be a fact of course so the concept of the belief of resurrection and accountability after death and the day of judgment this holds great value in making our lives as it is today because it defines us why wouldn't i cheat lie steal do things when there are no cctv cameras because i know that allah is watching and this by itself is a huge game changer in the life of a human being in the life of an individual after that the prophet focused allah on two main things on how miraculous the quran is which still date stands challenging and this is one of the basics and we will insha allah devote a an episode for the quran as being one of the basics in our religion that has been overlooked and ignored by many muslims so to prove to them to the whole world that this is miraculous this is allah's words allah's speech that you're reciting and listening and reading and this is challenging and there is nothing wrong with it it's infallible you cannot find a mistake in it so this was part of his dawah and finally it was essential in these 13 years to prove to them which was so obvious but it needed to be cemented as part of the foundation to prove to them that the prophet alaihis salatu is the messenger of allah the final messenger and the servant of allah almighty they knew this from day one that he was the honest the trustworthy that the one who never lied the one who never cheated the one he they could not hold against him a single thing 63 years that the prophet lived alice islam not a single negative thing can be quoted against him he was the perfect man ever to work to walk on earth so this needed to be continuously preached and shown and proven for them that he is the servant and the messenger of allah azza wajal these are the main principles alongside with exalting the moral conduct and the behavior of humans in terms of pardoning forgiving tolerating forbearing looking the other way because 13 years no fights no re retaliation these attributes were preached to the muslims so that the foundation now is set and strong and firm we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we'll be right back"
