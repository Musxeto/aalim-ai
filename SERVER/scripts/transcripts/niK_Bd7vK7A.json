  "title": "Can we say Sayyidina for NonMuslims? What about Sir or Mr.? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Hamid from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu There is an adif in Sunan Abu Dawood adif 4977 and it's graded as sahih by Sheikh Al Albani The adif is do not say Sayyidana Fi Munafiq because if he's really your master then you have angered your lord. My question is can we use Sayyid which means Mr. in English for non-Muslims not intending to honor them but because it is the norm. JazakAllahu Khair Wa Jazakum. Saying Sayyiduna means our lord or our master and the hadith is authentic we must not address this disbeliever or a hypocrite by glorifying them and praising them and saying that they are our masters our lords and they're the best of us as found in the media. Sometimes we hear this to some politicians who we can confirm that they are full-fledged hypocrites. Sometimes it's even said to disbelievers a Sayyid so and so he's a kafir. So those who accept it and say it willingly knowing that the prophet prohibited this they've angered Allah without any doubt. Now saying sir is a different story altogether because sir is said even to a janitor or a farmer or a layman or a bedouin or a nomad there is no problem in saying it at all and Allah knows best."
