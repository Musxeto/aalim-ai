  "title": "I spoke badly to my father as a teen— he’s passed away, what to do now and will Allah forgive me?",
  "transcript": "Mahmood from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu During my teenage years I sometimes spoke to my father in high voice and did rough behavior and now I regret my father died some years ago. Can I do anything for him and what can I do to save me from Allah's punishment? Number one you have to repent to Allah Azza Wa Jal which means that you have to have deep remorse over that sin and you have to ask Allah for forgiveness. Number two you should always ask Allah to forgive your father to expand his grave and to fill it with fragrances from Jannah and to have his blessings and favors showered over him. Number three you can do a lot of dua for him you can give charity on his behalf if you have money and you can make umrah or hajj on his behalf whenever you have the means to do that if you wish and inshallah with your remorse and asking Allah for forgiveness Allah will forgive you."
