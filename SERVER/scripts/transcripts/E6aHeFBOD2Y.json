  "transcript": "consider subscribing my name is nadeem yes i'm from libya from malaysia okay nadeem where is nadeem nadeem yes i want to assume sheikh yes sir the important question is you know i was think from 2020 to la sorry 2 200 to 2000 triple digits you know my mother has been injected with a kubit vaccine and i disagree with that because i know this is a poison so sheikh i want to ask you i'm from malaysia this our prime minister or whatever our own ministers they have forced us to take this vaccination thing but i don't believe in that but my mother has died can i go and kill the ministers not okay when did your mother die two months ago how long was it before she took the vaccine she took the vaccine on now is 22 08 she could have vaccine on 22.002 so almost how how long now in years months three months okay first of all okay i will ask you i will answer your question uh nadeem first of all i took three vaccines not one not true three with the booster and alhamdulillah i'm still working like the energized bunny i have no problem all of my family took it they have no problem all in my community in my country and i know hundreds and thousands of people no problem so to come and accuse the vaccine of killing your mom this is outrageous this is not logical number two when you say that our minister is the one who advised this our minister and your minister did not advise this because they have ill intent they don't want to kill people because we are their people they don't want to kill themselves and their loved ones and their relatives so they did it according to the medical reports that are overwhelmingly confirming that this is the only way to fight this pandemic in their opinion right or wrong we don't know they're the scientists and they claim to say this in this not one scientist it's hundreds of thousands against five or ten of those who oppose it and say no it's a conspiracy they want to do this they want to do that number three we cannot take the law into our own hands if you kill someone whether it's the doctor the nurse the manager of the hospital the minister the prime minister any tom dick or harry allah will throw you in hell simple as that it's your choice before you are thrown into hell you will be probably thrown into jail prosecuted maybe executed this is not a jungle allah has put sharia law to be implemented and he has placed a muslim ruler and underneath him a panel of muslim judges to look into such cases and to give their verdict if anyone accuses his neighbor of poisoning the water and causing his son to die and then he goes and kills the neighbor without any proof that can stand in a court of law then he is a murderer and he must be punished therefore we as muslims do not act upon our impulsiveness our demons our thoughts we act upon the sharia and we refer to muslim scholars muslim judges with proof evidence that can stand in a court of law not upon speculations upon i think maybe this and that this is not our religion and allah knows best and may allah have mercy on your mother and may allah grant her the level in jannah of shaheed eventually we are all going to die then what what makes us happy is after death where are we hell or heaven if we know that our loved ones did well in this life and they performed well then alhamdulillah what else do we want we want gender for them so if she died out of this and we pray that this was a cause of her elevation in jannah so be it and alhamdulillah because eventually she would have died sooner or later as we will die sooner or later you"
