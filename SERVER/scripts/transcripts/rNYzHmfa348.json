  "transcript": "cadman from bangladesh just my question is how the majority of scholars and solops used to treat with us please explain it okay i will answer inshallah sad man uh says how did the imma deal with the people of innovation and this requires a lecture and lots of quotations but at the end of the day why would we ask such a question if those people of innovation are living with us around us if i'm living in a country that 90 percent of the people are from the people of innovation would it be wise to treat them as disbelievers cut old ties they give salam i don't re reply to their salam they say salaam alaikum with a big smile and i grim in their faces and frown in their faces as if i want to spit on them and step on their necks what type of a muslim is this now don't get me and quote me wrong i'm not saying to be friend with them and at the same time i'm not saying that all people of innovations are the same only the people of ignorance who paint all people with the same brush so someone who makes congregational dua after the prayer is over is a people of innovation and someone who goes through dhargas and worship the grave people and call them is people of innovation are they the same of course not so the students of knowledge should have knowledge should have etiquette should have wisdom it's not collecting how did the imam sufyanathari react when someone of the people of innovation came and did this and that why did imam so and so not respond to the salaam of so and so why did they this is not quran and sunnah your quran your sunnah dictates how you treat people and never the prophet salam taught us to treat people in such a vicious and ruthless way just because they're people of innovation when we know that there are more than 100 shades of people innovation some of them are very acceptable but still innovation we can be friends we can tolerate we can talk to and give advice so this is a long topic that students of knowledge should pay attention to"
