  "title": "Should a latecomer recite opening Dua or Fatiha, & Dua even after imam gave Tasleem? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Zakaria from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So say someone's a follower in the Salah and the Imam starts to say Takbeer or the Tazleem or the Fatiha As soon as he starts to say it, should you stop what you're saying? Or should you finish it or can you like add another, like continue until he finishes and then start moving? This is not something that is prescribed in the Sunnah. The only thing that is prescribed is when the Imam starts reciting the Fatiha or the Surah, you should refrain and listen, specifically for the Fatiha. So if the Imam says Allahu Akbar and he's preoccupied with the Du'a al-Istiftah and I come like 10-15 seconds late, by the time he finishes I say Allahu Akbar and I want to say my Du'a, he starts reciting the Fatiha, I should stop. I should not say my Du'a al-Istiftah and I must listen to his Fatiha. He finishes, I'd like to recite the Fatiha. Then he starts his Surah. I didn't finish my Fatiha, I have the option to continue and I have the option to interrupt my Fatiha and skip it altogether and listen to his recitation. Anything else? No, there's no problem. He's in the Ruku' position, I'm saying Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem, he goes Sami'allahu liman hamida, while he's saying Sami'allahu liman hamida, I could say Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem two or three times, no problem, I can say that. Likewise in Sujood, likewise elsewhere. As for the Tasleem, if I'm in the salutation of the Prophet and he says Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah, Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah, I can continue. There's no problem in continuing for 10, 15, 20 seconds, etc. after his Salam. So I hope this answers your question."
