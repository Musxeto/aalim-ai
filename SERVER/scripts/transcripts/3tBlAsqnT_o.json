  "title": "He gets water in his throat when doing Wudu while fasting, can he just wet the nose with fingers?",
  "transcript": "isharak from singapore um i i wrote to you on your website um previously about pulling the water up our nostrils during fasting of course we all know of the hadith where the prophet sallallahu alaihi uh said that um to exaggerate in pulling the water up the nostrils except when we are fasting um what i wrote to you was even if i'm careful pulling the water up my nose when i'm fasting i tend to get some water in my throat and i asked if i can just wet my fingers and clean the insides of my nostrils and you said that we still have to pull some water up so um what do i do with because uh on the number of days this ramadan and some of the voluntary fasts that i've been trying to to keep i i end up with water in my throat and i try my best to actually spit the water out but what do you suggest i do to help with this issue this is not normal maybe you need to go to a doctor to a physician to check whether your nostrils are not normal they're this short because you don't have to inhale until it goes into your lungs into your stomach it's just a small drops of water and you just put it up your nostrils and up your nostrils here you don't have to pull it to your uh the top of your nostrils especially when you're fasting so to say that even if i try i still get some water inside of my throat or my stomach this is unacceptable you have to coach your self you have to discipline yourself you have to train yourself and it's not a valid excuse so i try my best and i could not do it no this is not valid we cannot bend the rules of sharia okay as long as you insist then just wet your finger and put it up your nose no that doesn't work this way do it don't exaggerate just pull it to the inside the cavity of your nose that is more than enough and blow your nose and inshallah things would be fine you"
