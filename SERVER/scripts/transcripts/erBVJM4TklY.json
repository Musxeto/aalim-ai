  "transcript": "Amr from Tunis, Tunisia? Amr? Hello, Assalamu Alaikum. Do you say Amir? Alaikumussalam. You are? Amir from U.S. Your name? Amir from U.S. Amir, okay. Yes, Amir. Yeah, sorry. So I was in a story, right? And I live in a non-Muslim country. Is it okay for me to like call people like, because you know, I heard you say like, people are kafir and self-proven otherwise or something like that in the non-Muslim countries. So if I see somebody who doesn't look like a Muslim, can I refer them as a kafir and self-proven otherwise? So what do you mean by refer to them as kafir, when you see them and say good morning kafir or good morning infidel? No, no, like say, when I'm like in the store, I see like, you know, maybe like a female, right? Like from the first gaze, like, and I just like lower my gaze and I like, you know, I sometimes I get mad, you know, because, you know, how they're dressed and I just say like kafir, you know? No, no, no, no, no. You shouldn't do this. This has consequences. It will build up in yourself until it is further, way further than resentment feelings. And then it may turn into hostility. You acknowledge people, people are not dressed properly. Welcome to the club. You are in a kafir country. What do you think they should be wearing? A nun's dresses? No, they are not Muslims. So you see them inappropriately dressed, you just lower your gaze and move on. Don't label people. You're not obliged to label them or to give them salam because they're not Muslims, but you don't have to say these things and fill your heart with such feelings that may trigger something that is not healthy."
