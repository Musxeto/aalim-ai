  "title": "Did the Prophetï·º pray 4 Rakats Sunnah after Isha & 11 rakats of night prayer at all times",
  "transcript": "from Bangladesh. Um we know from the hadith of Abbas that the prophet used to pray four raas of sunnah after isa and from the hadith of that um he used to preserve 11 raas of night prayer at all times. So he used to do he used to do what? preserve 11 raas of night prayer at all times. Okay. And the hadith of Abbas was what? Um he used to pray four raas of sunnah after Isa the f of isa there is no sunnah for after isa the hadith is not authentic. So what is it your question? Um so how do I preserve 11 ragas of my prayer u alongside tarawi in Ramadan? Okay, first of all, the hadith of mother Aisha that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam never prayed in Ramadan or other than Ramadan more than 11 raka night prayer and it's reported in Muslim. This hadith is not accurate in the sense that there are other narrations that he prayed 13 raqas as per the hadith of Abbas and she reported that as well. So some scholars say that the 13 refers to the two sunnah of ISA and the 11 of night prayer and some would say that no the prophet was mostly consistent on 11 but sometimes he may add more and sometimes he may pray less. Now the hadith that the prophet prayed sunnah after to my knowledge there is no such authentic hadith. The hadith of Habiba, may Allah be pleased with her and other uh uh narrators that the prophet said sallallahu alaihi wasallam. Whoever prays 12 rakas during the day and night other than the far Allah will build him a house in Jenna two raas before rakas before two ra after after two rakas after and two rakas after these are 12. So these are the conf confirmed emphatic sunnah to be prayed. Now after praying that you may pray 11 raqa night prayers which is usually included inaw for those who pray 11 raqa for those who pray 23 rakas it is included in them and extra. So there's no problem in doing that because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam never limited night prayer to 11 not to be exceeded."
