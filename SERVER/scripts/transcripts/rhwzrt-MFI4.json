  "transcript": "rejects polygamy so marrying more than one wife to them is not permissible illegal and they oppose it publicly though it is part of the quran part of islam some of them even goes a bit further like we've heard this in some muslim countries where they say it's not fair to give a daughter half what the son gets in inheritance so we would like to abolish this and they have to be equal some parents living in america and the uk do this when they write their will despite the opposition and objection of their children they say this is haram you're going against allah's commands so no no no this is harmony all of you should be equal in distribution of the inheritance after my death not knowing by rejecting the quran they've abandoned it and they've committed an act of apostasy"
