  "title": "Dawah: Tawheed #2 (Basics Part 6) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign [Music] and welcome to this new episode of your program in ramadan the basics today is the second segment where we will continue about talking about one of the most important basics in islam which is tohit yesterday we talked about two branches of tahit and that is the head of lordship and of worship the third branch of tawheed is the asma'i was to heed of the beautiful names and attributes of allah azza wajal and this is where a believer worships allah azzawajal by calling him by acknowledging him through his beautiful names and attributes the prophet allah said allah has 99 names a hundred minus one whoever calculates them will enter jannah calculating them means that you memorize them that you know them that you understand what they mean and that you implement them in your life so the core of this branch of tawhid lies upon your belief that allah has no equivalent to him nothing is compared to him nothing is unlike to him like him subhanahu azzawajal in anything the core is to believe in allah's beautiful names so when you say ar-rahim when you say ar-azak when you call him by his name al-khafur all of these names have many profound and strong meanings and the more you know them the closer you get to allah and if you remember last ramadan allah has blessed me to introduce to you the beautiful names of allah it's found on zad's youtube channel on my youtube channel on my website i would highly advise you to go and study them because this lays the foundation and cements your iman and strengthens it beyond recognition so that it would be an astonishing event in your life when you introduce the beautiful names of allah to your life so how to believe in allah's beautiful names and attributes by only believing that we cannot know or understand the beautiful names and attributes of allah except through what allah has told us about himself and what the prophet alas islam told us about allah and we take these beautiful names and attributes as they are we understand them as they were revealed to us in the arabic language without any distortion so we do not play with words without any twisting or misinterpret it's misinterpretation so we don't say that yeah this is the word but it means something else without denying the reality and without asking how these attributes are and if you look at all the deviant sects and cults who went astray like the jahmyah like the murtazila and those who followed suit like the ashara and maturidiya you'll find that they have done one of these mistakes or more in the beautiful names of allah and his beautiful attributes by distortion by manipulating or misunderstanding by denying the meaning totally and all of this took them astray now these branches of tawheed are the basics without them there is no success for the whole ummah and for us as individuals and this is why it's a grave mistake when we look at the arena and we see people focusing on things that may have some importance but they are not the real deal so in one country or one community the muslims are focusing totally on politics parties even if they have to lie or cheat or have coalitions with non-muslims or with deviant cults they say don't divide us let's unite how can you unite with someone who has a different akida who believes in a different god how can you unite with someone who endorses lgbtq plus or defends dismantling sharia laws or the prescribed punishments or ignores parts of the quran or the sunnah how can we collaborate with them how can we unite with them in some areas you find people neglecting everything and focusing on one of the important rituals of islam which is jihad but jihad cannot be established unless you have to hate a man came to join the army of the prophet and the prophet asked him as a clear straightforward question are you a muslim the man said no so the prophet said go away we do not seek help or assistance except from muslims the prophet is in need for fighters it's a life-or-death issue yet the heed is the dividing rule the dividing line where we cannot cross so everywhere you look you will find that there are good efforts for dawah but without tawheed all of this would be in vain because what's not based on the basics it will not have any value and this is why we keep on repeating the word we have to go back to tahit we have to revive the hate and this is why people hate us why do people hate us who could hate the heat it's in the quran it's the core of the religion who could hate to hate a lot of people those who go against the hate like the shia like the super sufis the super sufis are not people who just chance and give nasheed and swirl around themselves and maybe just do thicker a gazillion times a day no the super sufis have corruptacida when they believe that other than allah control the universe that the prophet salaam controls the universe as he controls the palm of his hand his hazernaza he sees everything this is a breach of taheed those people hate whoever preaches their heat though the heed is in the quran no denying that those who have hidden agendas political agendas now in present times who ignited the flame of tawheed again with the grace of allah and allah supported him and allah gave him acceptance in the whole world imam muhammad abdullah who hates him either the shia the super sufis the deviant sects and cults those who are grave worshipers those who invoke the dead those who [Music] endorse the selling and trading of amulets davis it's a business a multi-billion dollars business so when you come and preach people you have to have trust in allah you cannot rely on these things you cannot go to peers to cure your illness rather turn to allah you cannot go to soothsayers who would tell you what will happen in the future because only allah knows the unseen and the and the future all of these things are a breach of tahit nullifies a person's islam they don't know because the masters tell them otherwise they don't want you to [Music] have dependence and reliance on the quran and the sunnah you can't understand those except through us you have to come for me you have to give me baya pledge of allegiance and you have to be like a dead person in the hands of a man washing him so you have to obey me whenever you supplicate to allah always have me in your vision because i am the relationship between you and the prophet and i will have the prophet salaam when i make dua in my vision because he's the relationship between me and allah what kind of nonsense is this this is what they have in their cults in their sects all these tariqah they hate to hate and also some of those modernists who took off the cloak of the heat and they said that this is primitive this is like this is from arabia now we're in america we are in prestigious universities we have to act and talk like them even with nonsense at least they accept it and they've distorted and changed the deen they have issues with their hate they have issues with imam muhammad abdullah because he's from arabia he's from najd so when you hate arabia when you hate najd you hate everyone who comes from there so you start discrediting them tarnishing their reputation looking down at them they're not scholars anymore i've evolved i'm more stronger and powerful than this all of this takes you out of the basics and it shows you that you have gone astray there is no prosperity except with the hate so what is the importance of the hate there are many points that we can talk about the beauty of the hate simply because it can be endless due to the fact that this is what islam is about to hate short and simple so what is the importance of the hate first of all it tells you it instills in you as a servant of allah that allah did not create you except with the sole purpose to worship him does not need us does not need us praying for him or fasting or giving zakat or performing or umrah or hajj allah doesn't need us so those who object to say why did allah create us allah created you to order you to worship him and they say why did allah do that we were better off without that listen you're not talking to your peer at work you're not objecting you to your boss or your supervisor or to the prince of the town you're living in or to the prime minister or to the most powerful person on earth you are objecting to the one who created you the one who owns you the one who gave you life and takes life away from you when he wills you're objecting to the one who your breath cannot be without his permission the moment he wills it you'll stop breathing your heart will stop beating and you'll die this is the one you're objecting to you're objecting to the one who owns everything if he were to take the whole universe and toss it in hellfire can anyone object can you do anything about it nothing you can't do anything even if a small thing a small morsel gets stuck in your throat you'll choke to death ap can choke you to death you can't do anything about it it's allah so you don't have a choice he created you he ordered you to worship him and he told you if you comply i'll give you paradise as white as the heavens and the earth don't ask about the length and this paradise you will stay in it not 70 years that you lived on earth not 700 not 7 000 not 7 million you'll stay in it for eternity without an end and you'll be enjoying your head off with things that you cannot even imagine but if you decide to follow your whims and desires abandon tahit i'll toss you in hell fire forever and don't ask about the torment that you'll face there because you cannot even imagine it so it's not going to be burning you for a minute under a flame it's not going to be for an hour a day a year a thousand it's going to be for eternity so now you have the choice what's it going to be you want to go to paradise or you would like to enjoy this limited period of enjoyment on earth and which is not full it comes with a package it comes with baggage no one enjoys this world fully except those who have no hate can you imagine that those who have to hate enjoy their lives in this dunya because no civilization no modernization no happiness or tranquility can be attained except when you have to hate sheikh look at the most wealthiest man on earth whoever he might be he's got so much money so much wealth you telling me that he's not happy he's not happy and i'm sweating upon that his happiness is limited what kind of happiness is there when you eat a good meal and have stomachache or diarrhea what good is the most beautiful woman on earth when she files for divorce and takes half of your wealth happiness on earth is not complete except for those who have attained to hate allah says and if only the people of the cities had believed and feared allah this is their hate we would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth but they denied the messengers so we seize them for what they were earning only if you believe and allah says almighty whoever does righteousness whether male or female while he is a believer we will surely cause him to live a good life and we will surely give them their reward in the hereafter according to the best of what they used to do you want a good life you want tranquility in this life this is what you will get allah azzawajal told us that only through tawheed we can be guided in this life and the hereafter anyone and i repeat even among the muslims anyone who does not have full tawheed in his heart wallahi he will not live a happy life i know a lot of the muslims who memorize the quran who are not happy because they have not fulfilled it of hatred they have not accomplished it yes they pray and they fast but they don't have the conviction inside they have stress they have anxiety they have depression they have confusion they do not have the full tau hate allah says they who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice that is shirk this is the heat those will have security and they are rightly guided this is one of the fruits of tahit the salaf used to say if the kings the descendants of kings knew the happiness that we are encountering they would have fought us with swords to take it away from us and they used to say in this dunya there's a paradise who does not enter it will not enter the paradise in the hereafter what paradise are we talking about this is the result of the heat when you trust allah when you have full confidence in allah when you only fear him hope in what he has when you only love him when you have or seek refuge only in him and ask benefits only from him will you have your heart totally aligned with the hate wallahi you will be the happiest person on earth this is why we encourage people and we go out of our way calling them to the basics to tawheed this is why so many people keep on complaining why do you always talk about the heat or heat your hobbies are like this you are like that not knowing that only with tawheed we can prosperous and find success tomorrow insha'allah if there is life predestined for us we will discuss the third part which deals with the importance of tahit along side with where do we get the heat from what are the sources we have a short break stay tuned and insha allah will be right back"
