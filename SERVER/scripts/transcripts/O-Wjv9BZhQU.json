  "title": "They wrote: DO NOT SAY Ameen OUTLOUD in the Hanafi Masjid & think Prophet ‎ﷺ is Hazir Nazir",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu May Allah keep you strong in this age and guarantee everything that you desire in this dunya and akhira And you as well my friend Sheikh by circumstances I after work in the Friday prayer I attend the masjid and later I realized that unfortunately on the wall they have written do not say Ameen out loud and the imam of the Qutba doesn't start the Qutba with a customary introduction of the Qutba and he admits that Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is Aadir and Naadir and etc. So after realizing this should I just move out of the masjid or should I just pray? If you discovered that the imam has committed an act of shirk or kufr then you cannot continue to stay there you have to leave and look for another masjid to pray with. The writing that do not say Ameen, only ignorant imbeciles do this. So fanatic Hanafis may do this but they are a shame to the Hanafi school of thought. The beautiful huge great Hanafi thought school of thought with its great scholars. Such imbeciles are not attributed to this school. So anyone who writes this is an ignorant imbecile as if he's saying that the hadith where the prophet himself used to say Ameen out loud and the second row behind him not the first the second row would hear that as if they're saying that the prophet is wrong and if they do dare say such a thing they're out of the fold of Islam without any doubt. And if the imam did not start the khutbah in the normal traditional way I don't know what you're referring to. What he has to say as part of the khutbah is praising Allah, Alhamdulillah and the shahada Ash'hadu an la ilaha illallah wa ahda wa la sharika lah wa ash'hadu an muhammadan abduhu rasuluh and reciting one ayah. This is the bare minimum. If he doesn't do this at all, doesn't praise Allah, doesn't offer salutation of the prophet this is to a lot of the scholars of the schools of thought invalidates his khutbah. Thirdly if he says that the prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam is hathir nathir and he controls the universe and he oversees what's happening in this world this is kufr, this is blasphemy. So you can't pray behind such people and Allah knows best."
