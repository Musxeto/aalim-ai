  "transcript": "[Music] it is how close or far should someone be to be considered a neighbor there is no specific prescribed definition of your neighbor some scholars said a neighbor is a person who hears the adhan so if the adhan is in the masjid the vicinity that the adhan reaches these are all your neighbors some said your neighbor is the seventh door to your left right front and back so all those you count from one to seven are your neighbors some say your neighbors are every person who prays fajr in the masjid with you providing you which is unfortunate to see that so little of the muslims observe their prayers in the masjid so there isn't any prescribed answer for that and allah knows best"
