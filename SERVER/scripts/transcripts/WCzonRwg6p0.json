  "transcript": "So one good, sharp question from her side is that how to answer or react from the Christian friends that says Islam has many branches, including Shia, Sunni, Ahmadiyya and other Islam organizations. How should we answer upon that question? First of all, do I have to answer every question a Christian says against Islam? No. I have to present the real Islam. So when someone says Islam has many branches, Shia, Sunni, Ahmadiyya, not Muhammadiyya, Ahmadiyya. And so I said, listen, no, Islam has only one branch. It is the branch of the Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. This is Islam. Now, we talk usually to the Shia. When they say, no, you have to be Shia, you have to, I said, was the Prophet Shia? And they said, there was no Shia at the time of the Prophet. If there were no Shia at the time of the Prophet, why can't we be like the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam? End of story. So when they say to you this, you can say to them, okay, Christianity has Catholicism, Orthodox, Coptic, Protestant, they have many books, they have this and this and this. This is not something you can say about a religion. The religion of Islam is found in the Quran and the Sunnah. You want to ask me a question? Ask me about Quran and Sunnah. And I hope this answers your question. I hope this answers your question."
