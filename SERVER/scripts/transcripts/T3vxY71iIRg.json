  "title": "If a Person doesnâ€™t Pray Throughout the whole Year but Prays Jummah & Ramadan, is He a Muslim?",
  "transcript": "Amina From Pakistan she's I have a question uh if a person does not offer prayer prayer throughout the he only offers Juma prayer uh one day or the one time or the other and he only prays in Ramadan uh is he still considered to be a Muslim okay the vast majority of Scholars say that a person who does not pray at all the whole year is not a Muslim and this is the most authentic opinion someone who Goes to School only to attend the physical education class to play sports and skips six periods every single day at the end of the year would we say that he has passed or failed the exams he's a failure he's a drop-off a Dropout is is not considered to be part of the school and likewise a person who doesn't pray at all and if you tell him come and pray he says no I'm not going to pray and he prays one jummah on and two off and maybe three Germans uh on and three off depending on how he likes it such a person can't be a Muslim and this is generally speaking and such a person has to be admonished advised and reprimanded if he remains his wife should leave him and treat him as an apostate and ask for color because such a person is not worthy of living with even if he's a sweetheart even if he's earning and putting food on the table if he doesn't pray at all he's a cafe a lot of the sisters have counseling sessions with me and say that my husband doesn't pray what should I do ditch him totally divorce him leave him you can't stay with a Christian or with a Jew he's worse than a Christian or a Jew why if a Christian or a Jew slaughter a sheep we can eat the meat if this guy who doesn't pray at all a person who abandoned prayer Slaughters a sheep we cannot eat it it's a dead meat therefore this is something you need to simply draw the line if his connection with Allah is so bad and corrupt why should I even take care about him foreign"
