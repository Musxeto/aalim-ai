  "transcript": "Suleiha from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. If Imam combines Dua and Asr Salah due to rain, then at Asr time, if it stops raining, should we go to Masjid and pray Asr Salah again? JazakAllahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum. No, the answer is not. As long as you've prayed Asr at the time of Dhuhr due to a legitimate reason, such as heavy rain, or due to travelling. So even if I am travelling from one city back to my home town, and on the way I prayed Dhuhr and Asr at the time of Dhuhr. An hour and a half later, I so happen to reach my home town, and half an hour later the Adhan of Asr is called. Am I obliged to pray Asr again? The answer is no. I have already prayed it due to a legitimate reason at its legitimate time when travelling. The same thing happens if I combine Isha to Maghreb at the time of Maghreb due to heavy rain. At the time of Isha, the rain stops, and it's clear that I can go to the Masjid. I don't have to go to the Masjid anymore."
