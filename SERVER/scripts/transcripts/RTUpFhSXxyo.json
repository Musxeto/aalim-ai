  "title": "Does Spotting brown discharge affect my fast or prayer, is my fast valid",
  "transcript": "Sadiqa from Bangladesh I got spotting during Asr prayer so I didn't stop praying and I also don't break my fast. The spotting is more likely white discharge but fully reddish. I started having the flow of blood during Isha prayer so I didn't pray the Isha prayer. Now my question is do I need to make up the fast after the Ramadan because of the spotting? We've stated this before a number of times and said that it's an issue of dispute whether a woman when she gets spotting before her menses accompanied by cramps maybe or not and back pains etc. Should she consider this to be part of her menses or not? It's an issue of dispute. The most authentic opinion and this is the opinion of Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on his soul, that such spottings or colored discharges before the establishment of the flow of the blood are considered to be part of Istihadah. All what you need to do is after the Adhan, clean yourself, change the soiled clothes and perform wudu and pray. Once the flow of the blood is established, this is when you start to consider it as your menses. Therefore, your fast is valid. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
