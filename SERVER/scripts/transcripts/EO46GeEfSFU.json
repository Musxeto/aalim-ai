  "transcript": "if I have taken ablution and wore my socks then next time when I am taking ablution no need to remove socks and wash my feet question mark is that ablution valid question mark first of all this is known as wiping over the socks or the shoes in arabic alamos who idol who feign and this usually is found in the books of fit but also in the books of al Qaeda because this is part of the appeal of Alyson noÃ«l Gemara an imam ahmed narrated so many hadith about this from the companions and he says that I have not a shroud of doubt about this so this is why the scholars put it in the books of al Qaeda to differentiate the appiied of Allison l-jamaa from those who do not believe in wiping over the socks such as a how our age and a ruffler they rejected us understand algebra we believe in it and we apply it there are conditions for doing this so can I wipe on any socks or shoes no there are conditions the condition number one that you must put on the socks or the shoes you want to wipe over while you are in the state of voodoo so after I finished my Woodill now I can pray if I put on my socks now or after half an hour or an hour where I'm still in my state of would did not break my wooden in this case later on when I make woudl I can wipe over my socks or shoes so this is condition one to put it on as per the Himalayan Sherpa mail and pleased with them on or in the state of Odom second condition that the material of the hoof or the socks or the shoes is hello you don't wear skins of pig for example or of Mayta than animals because this is nature's and I'm not going to go into tanning and whether it is the meat is eatable or not of that animal I'm just giving a general idea number three that the socks covers the foot and the ankles so the area that is usually washed in woudl must be covered with the socks or with the shoes over the hoof because if it's below that you cannot wipe on it and number four is that you have to observe the time of wiping so a resident can wipe for a day and night 24 hours and a traveller can wipe for three days and three nights which is 72 hours and I hope this answers your question"
