  "transcript": "and not to asks is there anything particularly special about Friday night I mean is there any special arribada that can earn you great rewards on such nights or they are simply like any other nights without doubt the best of days of the week is the week is the day of Friday and we don't have to go to any a lot of lengths in explaining this because the Prophet said that some told us that the best of your days is the Friday now having said that the night of Friday is like the night of Eid and what do we mean by the nights of eight now we have two eights riedle up high and eight alpha tell some people before the fire of the eighth they spend it in night prayers and in a lot of a bada and this is an innovation why we're praying for allah azza wajal we're doing thicker because the prophet adam did not instruct us to do anything anything of of such likewise the night of Friday so if a person wants before tomorrow is Friday so before fajar only Thursday night late night which is before which is Islamic Lee called Friday night Friday night is the night that precedes the fetcher of the day of Friday this is called Friday night this this is why when the Sun sets this night is tomorrow's night not today's night so today now inside the Arabia where I am it's between Mahadevan Asia today is Saturday this night that I'm talking to you live in is called Sunday night so it precedes the day in Islam there for Friday night has no significance none whatsoever except in offering the salutation to the prophet alayhi salaatu sarah who said that whenever it is the day of not the day of Friday or the night of Friday offer a lot of salutation to me as much as you can because your salutation will be displayed to me how is it displayed an angel comes to the Prophet Elisha and tells him awesome just offered salat upon you allahumma salli wa sallim ala nabina muhammad so this is the only virtue that I know of that Friday night has is it permissible to recite Surat al-kahf in it and if you have disputed the most authentic is that reciting surah al-kahf is limited to the daytime so after the Adana fajar you can recite surah kahf on a friday day on a Friday until just before the sunset of that Friday and the larger knows best"
