  "transcript": "as a doctor this is from a sister as a doctor we have to interact with naan mahaan impatient and non muharram colleagues how do I maintain my hijab in my interactions at the workplace sometimes I have palpate a male's body as part of the physical examination whatever is necessary then this is permissible providing you do not transgress so patients if I have a male patient and I'm a female doctor and there is no other male doctor that can do this yes this is for a necessity exactly like when my wife has to be examined by a male doctor because there is no female doctors this is permissible for necessity but if there is a male doctor that can do the job then why would I come and intervene no I should make it clear to them that I am more comfortable and this is my religious belief and conviction that I should treat children and females only as for the interaction of or with male colleagues this is not permissible unless it's a necessity so a milk male colleague says patient in room 2 1:5 he was given this dose of so-and-so is this the right amount or it should be more or less and you say you're a nun madam I don't speak to you no this is business this is work so I said no the amount is good doing should increase it you should decrease it it should be taking over a duration of 8 hours comes but if he comes and says good morning doctor how are things don't refer to him whatever what is this I'm not your friend I'm a colleague at work and you have to know that I have a job near calm and I'm abiding by this law I'm not gonna interact with you oh oh sir or chef this is rude should so what better to be rude than to suffer in Hellfire so what's next how are you doctor good morning everything is fine tomorrow I brought you some cappuccino cappuccino I share a lot about Akala next day my place or yours no this is totally out of the question keep your limit working in a mixed environment is haram for doctors and nurses due to its communal obligation and that we have to have females in this field we say it is okay with a lot of conditions surrounding it otherwise it becomes Haram as it used to be so be careful and avoid that analyst"
