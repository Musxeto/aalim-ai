  "title": "If a latecomer ask someone who already prayed to join him & who should LEAD?",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing uh abdullah from japan if i'm not mistaken a couple of episodes ago one brother asked you um if he comes late for the congregation um if it's okay for him to ask the one who had already prayed to join him in the prayer and you said it's okay so i kind of wanted to follow up on that in that situation um who should lead the prayer um you know can the one who had already or should the one who is about to pray to it it doesn't matter both ways are fine basically and ideally speaking the one who memorizes the quran most would be the one who leads the prayer it doesn't matter whether the imam is the one praying the farilah or praying voluntary prayers and the evidence backing this up is the famous hadith of murad ibn jabal we know that muad ibn jabel may allah be pleased with him one of was one of the most learned companions and a scholar among the companions and in the hadith the authentic hadith narrated by bukhari and others he used to attend the risha prayer with the prophet and after concluding the prayer he used to go to his tribe and lead them in isha which is asia for him which is voluntary for him and followed for them none of them objected and said hey hey wait we should be leading the prayer because we're praying fault and you're praying voluntary because he was the most knowledgeable the most among them who memorizes the quran so it doesn't matter which one leads because the prayer is valid both ways ideally speaking it should be the one with more quran and lanos best you"
