  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, my question is regarding the story of Musa Alayhis Salaam like when he unintentionally killed one of the person then he immediately he asked Allah for repentance and in Surah Qasas it says that هذا من عمل الشيطان so one of the Sheikh while giving Tafseer he said that when we do anything wrong we are allowed to blame Shaytan for our actions because Musa Alayhis Salaam blamed Shaytan for this action but in the Quran it says that whatever we do we are blamed for our own actions so I wanted your help with that I was not confused I got confused by that person Jazak Allah Khair Wa Jazakum if you go a little bit earlier in time and you read in the Quran that our father Adam and our mother Hawwa or Eve and they ate from the forbidden fruit and from the prohibited tree the word used in the Quran فَأَزَلْ لَهُمَ الشَّيْطَانِ Shaytan made them trip and fall in this sin so there is no problem in attributing a sin to the whispers ارحمكم الله to the whispers of Shaytan there is no issue in that but it does not justify it I wouldn't say that whoops I dealt in Riba I took a mortgage and I bought a house and I consumed a bottle of Haram and did some drugs it's all from Shaytan no I did it I chose it but the whispering was from Shaytan the guidance or misguidance was from Shaytan and there is no problem in that introducing NISF a privacy focused Islamic matchmaking app that follows the Sunnah no photos, no chatting and a Wali-involved matchmaking process create a unique profile use our comprehensive filters to search for profiles and send requests once a request is accepted your phone number or your Wali's if you are a female is shared find a pious spouse the Sunnah way download NISF now www.nisf.org"
