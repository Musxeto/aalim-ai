  "title": "Visiting niece/nephew when only sister in law is in the house? Assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Adi Kanol from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam I would like to visit the children of my brother. He is not around. The children are like 10 years old maximum. Can I call his wife to say I'm coming to visit you or would that be impermissible because I'll be visiting the children? But I'm actually visiting the children, not the wife. Is that permissible for me to visit the children? If there are no other adults with you or in the house, this is inappropriate. Even if your intention is pure to visit your nephews and nieces, but anyone who would see you enter the house of your own brother when he's absent, when there are no adults, knowing that only your sister-in-law is in the house, would think dubiously of you and would doubt you. So this is totally inappropriate and subhanAllah your addiction to meeting them or you being fond of meeting them can wait. Or you can ask your sister-in-law to send them out so that you can take them out or to visit you at your house etc. but not to go to your brother's house when he's not there and where there are no adults."
