  "title": "Gold Sticker Protects you from Radiation, can men use it? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Qul hadhi sabili adu'u ila Allah We have brother Mohammed from Sweden. So I have this question about this sticker, right? And it's like anti-radiation. And it's like gold. Now I don't know if it's real gold. It says it's 24K but one piece only costs $1. So I don't know if it's okay or not. If it's real or not. But is it permissible to use small amounts of gold to protect yourself from harm? From electric devices? You know, small amount of gold. And it's on the phone. So is it permissible to use gold or do I have to use another color? Jazak Allah Khairan. This thing you're talking about, is it inside a mobile phone or inside a computer? No, it's like a sticker, like you put on top of it. What does it do? What does it do? It protects you from radiation, you know, from harmful radiation from the phone. And I'm sensitive to it so like I have to have it. Otherwise I can use phones. Okay. If it has real gold in it and you're not wearing it and it is used for another purpose other than wearing it, then this is permissible, inshaAllah. Having gold in your cufflinks or in your pen that you're using, this is wearing it. But to have gold components in your mobile phone or in your computer, this is totally fine. Now the claim that this sticker prevents you from radiation, I very much doubt this. I believe that this is a scam. But if it were true, you can simply take it to any jeweler's shop and they will test it and they will say that there is no gold in it because the price is definitely ridiculous and it is not gold, but it's just a claim and Allah knows best. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
