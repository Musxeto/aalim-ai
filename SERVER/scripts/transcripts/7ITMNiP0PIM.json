  "transcript": "Faheem from Bangladesh Faheem Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh since we don't speak Arabic it's hard for us to understand translation and keep concentration in congregational prayers especially during Taraweeh at congregation which takes one hour daily for 20 rakah. The Imam is fast and it's hard for us to keep focus. Our mind gets super busy with many worldly dunya things. Is it a form of humiliation? I mean is it still good to pray behind the Imam or it's better to pray Taraweeh at home with the small chapters like Surah Falaq, Surah Ikhlas, Surah Nas, etc. etc. JazakAllah. Wa Jazak. Alhamdulillah the reward is fixated if you pray behind the Imam this half an hour or one hour Allah would reward you as if you prayed the whole night. While if you pray at home for three four hours that would not be equivalent to praying in congregation. So my advice to you is to pray with the congregation try your level best to ponder upon Allah's greatness, Allah's beautiful names and attributes, Allah's favors and blessing upon you and inshaAllah you will be rewarded for that."
