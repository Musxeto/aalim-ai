  "transcript": "Rashad from Tunis IA moved to the Philippines and I found out that most of the meat they're selling is slaughtered they are Catholic so is it okay to buy it or even eat in the restaurant or should I ask if the animal is slaughtered whenever I go to eat somewhere or buy the meat online the Philippines is predominantly a Catholic Christian country which means that the default is the meat that is served and sold in such a country is halal for us Muslims to eat as per chapter 5 Surah where Allah tells us that the slaughtering that is done by the people of the book is halal for us Muslims to consume therefore you don't need to check whether it's slaughtered or not you don't need to ask because this is a predominantly Catholic country you can go and buy online or from them or in their restaurants without any problem insha'allahu as foreign"
