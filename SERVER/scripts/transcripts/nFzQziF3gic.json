  "transcript": "So who does Allah test? Well, calamities and testing is a sign of Allah's love to you. And I can hear someone say, I don't want to be tested and maybe I don't want Allah to love me. Just I'd like to be safe. No. The Prophet ﷺ said, when he was asked, O Messenger of Allah, which of the people are most sorely tested? So the Prophet ﷺ said, the prophets. They are the most sorely tested. The prophets of Allah Azza Wa Jal. Then the next best and the next best. A man will be tested in accordance with his level of religious commitment. If his religious commitment is strong, he will be tested more severely. And if his religious commitment is weak, he will be tested in accordance with his religious commitment. Calamity will keep falling. A calamity will keep befalling a person until he walks on earth without a single sin on him. Allah would eradicate and erase all sins because of these calamities that had struck him."
