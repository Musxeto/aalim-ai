  "transcript": "H from Germany sh I have a question like is it permissible to pray at home in a jamama of two instead of going to the mosque because of cold or some other reasons not every day but sometimes or is it obligatory to go and pray in the mosque it if the Masjid is within your vicinity within a walking distance of 10 minutes to maybe 13 minutes then it is mandatory for you to pray as a man in the Masjid unless there is a legitimate reason such as heavy rain or heavy snow that would endanger you or hamper you this cold you're talking about does not impact you going to school work or to do the groceries why should it then impact you going to the Masjid it doesn't make any sense and Allah Knows Best"
