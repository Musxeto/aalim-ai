  "title": "If I see someone walking to the masjid, should I stop and offer them a Lift or Accept one?",
  "transcript": "and if i see a brother going to the masjid can i stop for him to come in and what's the opposite here if i'm going by walking if a brother stop for me should i accept his offer or should i say the hadith now we know that walking to the masjid is far greater in reward than riding to it but there is nothing at all in islam that prohibits riding instead or says that you should decline therefore it's up to your preference and it depends on the time of ikama so if i'm driving and i see a brother walking to the masjid and i know it would take him five minutes to reach the masjid but the comma is within 20 seconds so i offered to take him so that he would not miss araka being smart he would say i accept but if somebody is going before the time of salat and he is an elderly in his 50 in his 60s walking is beneficial for him and you insist on taking him with you depriving him from these steps depriving him from the workout he needs i would not recommend this just give him salam and move on and likewise for me if i am to were to walk and someone would stop and offer me a lift i would decline thankfully and diplomatically and say no i'd rather walk and get the reward for that but it's up to your preference there is no clear-cut haram in this this is up to a person's choice alhamdulillah you"
