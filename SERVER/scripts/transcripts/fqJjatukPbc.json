  "title": "I have 3 mosques nearby; reply to Adhaan each time or once?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, the place where I live, there are three mosques, and when the adhan is called, I am able to hear all three adhans. Which mosque adhan should I reply? Because the place of each is different. So should I reply to all three adhans or only one? So choose one that is closer. Usually I'm lazy, so I know which adhan is quicker. So I wait until it starts and I say behind him and finish in 0 to 60 in a few seconds, rather than the person that takes 5-6 minutes. So it's up to you Akhi."
