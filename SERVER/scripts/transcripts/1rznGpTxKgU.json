  "transcript": "The next questions, where are you? I'm here, yeah. Yang di atas, silahkan. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam. Sheikh, I'm Amanda. So from what I collect from your speech, we need to stand the ground for our Aqidah. So then we have to learn about all of it. But the more, sometimes the more I learn, we learn about Ibadah. Some days I feel waswas. Waswas sepiye, mbak. Yes. Ikul opo waswas sepiye. It's Arabic. Everyone laughing at you is having waswas. Trust me. So to what extent we have to learn, because we learn about hellfire, about sinning, about ETC, to the extent that I have a feeling about waswas for daily Ibadah. And straight to the point please, the question. So what to prevent the waswas? Okay, I'll answer you inshallah. Thank you. In chapter 114 in the Quran, Allah says, قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ مَلِكِ النَّاسِ إِلَٰهِ النَّاسِ Three beautiful names and attributes of Allah. قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ مَلِكِ إِلَٰهِ Okay, of what? What are you seeking refuge in these names of Allah Azza wa Jal? مِن شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ I'm seeking refuge in Allah, in these beautiful names and attributes, from the whispers. And this is the meaning of waswas. It's not flip-flop. It's something like it. So waswas is the whispers. And من شرِّ الوسواسِ الخَنَّاسِ خَنَّاسِ is a description of Shaytan. He comes little bit, little bit, little bit, without you feeling it. When you say, أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ المَشْتَارِ الرَّجِيمِ He يَخْنُصُ, he runs away. The moment you're not aware, he comes back again. So he keeps on running and coming. This is the meaning of what? الخَنَّاسِ So Allah is telling us that this is with us till the day we die. Nobody can escape waswas. If you go to the CV, the resume of Shaytan, you'll find it on LinkedIn. If you go in his CV, it says, I have a job. My job description is to get you with me in hellfire. Correct? Any other objective? I don't care. You go to Hajj 50 times, good for you. You end up in hellfire with me, good for me. This is what the job description of Shaytan is all about. So how does he do it? He does it through whispers. He does it through overthinking. He does it over exaggeration. He develops anxiety and panic attacks. That destroys your mental health. And he said, what if my wudu is not valid? I'll wash my hands 10 times. No, 50 times. What if najasa sprinkled on my body? This is what I do in my counseling sessions, by the way. I open your eyes, because this is my job. Yeah, okay, I charge money, but you can't afford it, don't come. So he says, wash the toilet seat. Wash the floor, wash the walls, wash the whole toilet. And you find people spending two hours in the toilet. And the family members, knock, knock, knock. What are you doing? I'm coming, I'm coming. And then they pray. And they find ghuswas in prayer. Allah. Allahu ak. Astaghfirullah. What are you stuttering about? So, Assalamu alaikum. No, no, I have to go make wudu. I know people like this. They come to me, they cry, they weep. Sheikh, I don't want to end up crazy. They go to psychiatrist. Psychiatrists are very good, mashallah. Okay, Prozac, take this medication, smoke marijuana. And the guy says, oh man, it's good. This psychiatrist is good. Maybe a shot of gin and tonic would make it easy. So, ghuswas is always there. It's with you. I get men coming to me crying. Sheikh, I divorced my wife. He said, okay. But I didn't divorce her. Excuse me. Did you or did you not? I don't know. Did you hate her? No, I love her. Did you say I divorced you? No. But I said banana. Okay. Maybe, Sheikh, banana in Zimbabwe means I divorced you. I don't know. I don't want to leave my wife. I hope Mufti doesn't get offended by this. Not Zimbabwe, Mozambique, let's say. Some other country. So, this ghuswas comes and it's cascaded into kufr or shirk. Oh, did I laugh when the Sheikh was saying something about halal, haram? Oh, I'm a mushrik. I'm a kafir. I have to say shahada. So, they end up saying shahada 50 times a day. I have this every day. Hundreds and thousands of people come to me with this. Ghuswas is always there. Okay, Sheikh Asim. Do you get ghuswas? Yeah. You too get ghuswas? Everyone gets ghuswas. But, if your knowledge is good and strong and your eyes are clear, you know how shaitan works. I know how shaitan works. We went to the same school. Anyhow, I know how shaitan works because I deal a lot with people. So, all what I do is open their eyes and make them see the road. Ghuswas goes. So, you get the ghuswas? Yes. Two seconds, three seconds and it goes. Some people, it stays with them for one minute. But then say, And they're fine. Some people, it stays with them for a couple of hours. Some people, for a few days. Some people, for a few months. And some people, it kills them. And when it kills them, they say, There is no hope. I'll leave Islam. I will not pray fajr. And this is what makes shaitan say, Good work. Thumbs up. I will follow you on Instagram. Mashallah. Yes, sir. Thank you very much."
