  "transcript": "says sometimes i'd like to go for quantity rather than quality which is not prohibited so in order to finish the quran in a shorter period of time i may be required to recite in al hader in a fast paste which means that a lot of the mudud would be shortened so instead of saying [Music] i would say so that's half the time would i be sinful for that the answer is no you will not be sinful because a tajweed is not mandatory to do these mudud is a highly recommended sunnah and is part of the quality of your recitation of the quran but it is not mandatory and you can skip that without a problem"
