  "title": "Does a man have to obey his parents in their choice for his marriage? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mohammed says I am a man do my parents have the right to regulate who my future wife is if I marry with my own choice and they don't approve do I lose the reward of Bill rule while edane better why detain is being dutiful to your parents now being dutiful to your parents does not mean that you destroy your life and the life of a woman you're not interested in getting married to this is something we have to be clear I love my parents I adore them I'm dutiful to them I'm obedient to them I respect them the most I'm willing to do whatever I can to please them but there are things in life that they have no control of for example I'm inclined to engineering and my father my father's wish is that I study medicine I may make it in medicine college but it's not what I want and my father insists that he wants a doctor in the family my advice do not obey your father and go towards what you feel comfortable more in and what you would be productive because obeying your father in something that has harm on you and brings him no real benefit is not mandatory not only that it can be prohibited now my mother insists marry my niece take your cousin she's a good woman I want you to marry her and you feel that she is a sister to you you cannot marry your sister or you feel that you not at all attracted to her she's of a different personality than you you are inclined to things that she doesn't like and she's inclined to think that you don't definitely desire this is a prescription to failure maybe the marriage would last for a year or a bit less or more inevitably it's going to end and sadly it usually does and with baggage meaning that she's pregnant or she has a couple of kids and you can't go on and you divorce her so today your mom insists don't think today think five years down the line do you think do you see yourself married to the same woman so I don't want to think no you have to think always think of the consequences to tell you the truth I think that I may last for a couple of years not five maybe with reconciliation with my moms crying and people advising me it would reach five years but then definitely it won't progress I don't like her so why did you marry her from the beginning pressure then ah hey be a man and if you fall weak under their pressure then you're not man enough to get married yes you must not obey them in choosing a girl that you not only don't like you may resent you must not marry her now to be fair sometimes you have to be objective so if your mom brings you a girl and she says that this is a good girl you have to considered to in marriage and I'd like to see you married to her don't block it from the very beginning rather check it out maybe the woman is righteous and a good practicing woman maybe she is from a good family maybe she is beautiful or at least adequately accepted to look at maybe she is someone you would feel comfortable talking to give it a chance go and propose sit with her have the interview for an hour and a half and then press the harem if you feel comfortable even if she's not Miss Universe there are people that you'll find instant chemistry they tell you this girl is good for you you go and see her no no no I don't want her okay wait you're having ideas and convictions before even starting the interview no go without having premeditated ideas once you sit and talk you may find chemistry and Wow this girl's great she is like my soul mate and you're hooked hamdullah if not then tell your mom sorry mum this is not the girl that I was hoping to get married to end of story and no harm is done so again do not mix beer rule while edane being dutiful to your parents with marrying someone you don't want because there is no relationship and none whatsoever"
