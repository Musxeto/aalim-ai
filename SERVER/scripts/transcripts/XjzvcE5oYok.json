  "transcript": "We have, I think, Siddiqa from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Your name, Akhi? Siddiqi Aman. Siddiqi. Hayyakallah. What can I do for you, Akhi? I want to know that in Islam, prophets exist? And if yes, then I heard somewhere that Mary, the mother of Isa or mother of Moses, they are considered to be prophetess by some scholars. And I heard somewhere that Jews have saying thatâ€¦ Okay, you have time for one question. So your first question is, are you asking about the existence of female prophets in Islam? Yes or no? Yes. Okay. The answer is no. There is no prophets among the females in Islam since the time of Adam, nor there are prophets or messengers among the jinn. Because Allah would not choose a prophet or a messenger except from the humans. And this is the most authentic opinion among scholars and Allah knows best."
