  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Germany I wanted to ask um so I live in Germany and at \nschool we sometimes in German class we sometimes   read like novels and things like that which \num which has Kufr things um it's not about   like it's not um talking bad about Islam or \nsomething like that but it's just things which   are covered and if I would be sitting there and \nnot leave in this class would I be one of them   first of all the verse you're referring \nto is verse 140 chapter 4 Surah Al Nisaa to the end of the verse and this verse talks \nabout willingly sitting with Hypocrites that are   slandering Islam cursing Islam and the \nMuslims and the prophet in the Quran   and not doing anything about it this is not the \nsame case with you and other students in schools   so in order for them to get a degree which \nentitles them to have a University degree and   have a job and be able to function where they live \ngenerally speaking not going into details they   have to undergo such studies so in their school \na curriculum there might be novels literature   scientific theories that go against Islam studying \nthose would not be endorsing it or believing in it   you may study some Greek myth or something \nabout their novels or you may study Darwinism   and you don't believe in that definitely but you \nhave to pass your biology test otherwise you flunk   and get dismissed so what to do there's \nno problem in going all the way with them   while resenting and abhorring this \nkufr and this nonsense because this   is a necessity that one has to um take and \nundergo in order to pass the exams online"
