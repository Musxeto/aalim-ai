  "transcript": "is it permissible to give the fidia to one's own children and grandchildren as an meal as far as FID is concerned is mentioned the Quran Bak 2 ver 184 that if a person can do with hardship he should feed one Indigent person one poor person for every F at missed as far as given to the grandchildren is concerned it's mentioned here in the Quran that fidya should be given to a poor person so if the grandchildren aren't poor or the children aren't poor you can't give fidya to them they should be poor if they're rich then you cannot give Point number two fidya is somewhat like zakat zakat you can't give to a person who's dependent so the children are dependent to the father even the grandchild are dependent so but natural in this context fidya cannot be given to the children and the grandchildren and the third point to be noted is that if the person is very poor and the children are not dependent on the father or the grandfather because he's so poor he doesn't have might to look after them only in that case at The Last Resort he can give fidya to the grandchildren or children based on the Hadith of say bukari volume number three book of fasting Hadith number 1936 when a person comes to the prophet he gives the basket of date to him and say that feed it to the poor people he say that should I give it to someone who's poorer than me and my family prophet says yes so he said by Allah I do not know of anyone any family who's poorer than my family between the two mountains of Madina so the prophet Smiles where M can be seen and he says okay feed your family so in this case where the family is very poor and they are dependent on the father or the grandfather in this case thought it can be given as as FID to the children grandchildren as far as saying it's AAR party that's not a problem at all but the general ruling is it cannot be given to the rich people at the last we thought if they're really poor again"
