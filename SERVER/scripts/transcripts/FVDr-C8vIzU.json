  "title": "If the Masjid is a half hour walk away from me, can I pray at home even for Friday Prayer",
  "transcript": "Daniel from Norway. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. I love less you and your family Sheikh. And you as well. I had a question regarding the Friday prayer. For me the masjid is you know half hour walk and I remember in one of your other photos if it's a half hour if it's that distance you know you don't need to it's not obligated to go there and with the Friday prayer I wondered if it takes the same ruling or if it's a bit different. No it's different it is different the half an hour ruling is for the five daily prayers as for Friday prayer even if it's an hour drive you have to go there whenever you're in a city residing in it if the closest masjid is an hour walk you have to go there because this is Jumu'ah this is once in a week there's no um excuse for you for skipping it."
