  "transcript": "Muhammad from Holland or from the Netherlands? Muhammad? I have a question. Again, did you say Salaam? I had a question about wronging others. About what, Akhi? About wronging others. Wronging others, okay. What's your question? Yes, my past is haunting me. I get a lot of Suas and yeah, I get past sins in my head and I don't know what to do. Okay, I will answer you In Sha Allah. The Prophet said, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, whoever transgresses against a Muslim brother, he should rectify this before the Day of Judgment. As on the Day of Judgment, there are no Euros or Dollars. There is no Dirham or Dinar. Rather, it's good deeds and bad deeds. So the default is, you made a sin, you come and ask me for forgiveness. I took your money, I backbit you, I slandered you. If you know that I will forgive you or ask for compensation, you have to do this. If you think or believe that this would escalate and cause more harm, because before telling me, you and I were acquaintance, friends. As-Salamu Alaikum, what's happening, we hang out together. But when you came and said this to me, I became outrageous and I became outraged and angry and said, no, what did you say? No, no, I have to know exactly what did you say and who did you say it in front of? And if you tell me, I may boycott you for the rest of my life, this is more harm than good. So no, you have to refrain, not to tell me what to do. Either you come and ask me for general forgiveness. Shaykh, I did something wrong to a lot of people, including you, so may Allah forgive me. And if you said anything against me, Shaykh, may Allah forgive you. Most people, not me, would say, may Allah forgive you. So if you know that this general forgiveness is applicable and possible, do it. If not, then you make dua for the person, try to say good and positive things about him in the same places where you have slandered him or backbite him or did wrong to him. Try to return whatever financial wrongdoings you did to him, indirectly, if you're afraid that if he were to know, would cause problems or call the police on you. And inshallah, this does the job and Allah knows best."
