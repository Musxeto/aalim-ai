  "title": "What if Unsure of the Number of Days one has Missed Fasting? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "if a person is unsure about how many fasts he has broken or missed how should he calculate the number of fasts that he has to make up if a person doesn't know how many fast he has missed or can't remember or can't recollect then he should make a rough estimate but he should not underestimate it you should make a rough calculation and fast if he overestimates my little it's not a problem neither should he overestimate too much because should not overburden himself so he should make a rough calculation to the best of his memory to the best of his understanding little bit overestimate no problem but not too much and neither should underestimated and he should complete that fast but there are some three points to be noted number one is he should depent for it but he missed or he could not fast depent for it and Allah says in the Quran in Sur n chapter number 24 verse number 31 he says that oh those who believe they turn to their lord in forgiveness so that they may attain Bliss so that they go to jna again Allah says in the Quran in Bak chapter number two verse number 286 that Allah subhah wa tala does not lay a burden on a person greater than he can bear so a person should repent and he should make up the fast as soon as possible which whatever understanding he has of the number of fast he has missed and Allah says in Surah tabun chapter number 64 verse number 16 that fear Allah as much as you can listen and obey so person should keep the fast makeup of the fast as soon as possible preferably as soon as possible but naturally before the next Ramadan comes and the third point is that though it's not a must some Scholars think that if he has missed it and too much delayed Etc he should even give experation that is feeding one poor person for every fast year though most of the scholars agree that it's not a must but if person can do if you can give then it's preferable but it's not a must"
