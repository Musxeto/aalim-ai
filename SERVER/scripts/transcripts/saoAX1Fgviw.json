  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum, I have a question to ask you, what is the best advice you would give to someone who wants to be loved by Allah? The Hadith Al-Qudsi Allah Azza Wa Jal says وَمَا تَقَرَّبَ إِلَيَّ عَبْدِي بِأَحَبَّ مِمَّا افْتَرَضْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ Allah says in the Hadith Qudsi My servant would never ever get closer to me with things more beloved to me than what I have obligated upon him. So you want Allah Azza Wa Jal to love you? Fulfill the commands, Salah on time, in Masjid, Siyam, fasting Ramadan, giving Zakat Then Allah says, and my servant keeps on offering voluntary deeds until I love him. Allahu Akbar So this is what Allah says, you want Allah to love you? Offer a lot of voluntary deeds. How many hours do you pray at night? Why would I pray at night? I sleep. Okay, now we know what's the problem. How many times do you finish the Qur'an recitation a month? Maybe every six years. We have a problem. What about your Adhkar in the morning, in the evening, before going to bed, after Fard Salah, before leaving the house? I don't know any Adhkar. Okay, then where are you? I'm a Muslim. What kind of a Muslim? You definitely are far, far away from being loved by Allah. Allah says, and my servant keeps on doing and offering voluntary deeds until I love him. Okay. And when I love him, I become his sight that he sees with. I become his hearing that he hears with. I becomes his hand that he beats with. I become his foot that he walks with. And if he were to ask me, I will give him. And if he would seek refuge in me, I would give him refuge. La ilaha illallah. This is Waliyullah. This is the servant that Allah loves. You want Allah's love? This is the way to it. May Allah make me and you among those whom he loves."
