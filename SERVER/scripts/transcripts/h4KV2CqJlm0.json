  "title": "What to do if someone insults the Prophet ‎ﷺ? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay basically the person is asking about uh you know they are nowadays they are group of people who are saying that the one who saw the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam who does any blasphemy should be killed and what what is the son of islam on these the people need more explanation pleasure there is a book that was written by sheikh islam in tamiya a big volume and it's called which deals entirely with this situation the ruling on those who curse or insult the prophet and this is an issue of dispute among scholars in terms of what to do so killing such a person is not at all an option for the masses and this is what counts to us so a person curses the prophet or insults the prophet says son should i take my gun and shoot him in the head saying that he did something really bad the answer is no why sheikh didn't he do something offensive that deserves death penalty i said yes and no yes because his crime is punishable by death but no because no one is permitted to carry out such a punishment except the muslim ruler otherwise i could meet any tom dick and harry in the street and because we had an argument i dislike the person i shoot him in the head and i said to anyone who asks me why did you kill him he said he cursed the prophet i'm a liar but who can object to that so the issue of a person who insults the prophet allah must be tried by a muslim court and the muslim court would ensure that the person is saying that all the conditions of apostasy applies to him that there are no obstacles that prevent it from being implemented once we agree in this case they take their resolution or their ruling to the muslim ruler and the muslim ruler is the one qualified authorized to execute such a verdict which is execution whether he is executed as an act of apostasy or as a person um who had done a sinful act is an issue of dispute but death is his ruling after a court a muslim court rules it and the muslim judge or the muslim ruler executes such a verdict and ruling on allah knows west"
