  "title": "Getting Wiswas about making intention to fast | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sabri says I was having her because I was going too fast but literally during failure than I said in my heart I intend to fast okay this is West from Shaitan whether you said in your heart after the event before the event your suhoor your pre-dawn meal is a sufficient intention don't allow Satan to mess up with your mind I don't have to say to myself I intend to go to the toilet and to make number one or number two I just opened the door and locked myself in and do what I have to do business as usual so intention is not something that you verbally say or something that you verbally think of it's something that you do you intend to do and your suhoor is sufficient"
