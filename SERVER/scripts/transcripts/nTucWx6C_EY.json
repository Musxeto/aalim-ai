  "transcript": "Now, when I say don't divide, does this mean we cannot have difference of opinion? Of course not. We have to differ. This is right, I say left. This is black, I say white. But, at the end, we are united. In Mina, we're supposed to pray only 2 raka'a Zuhr, 2 raka'a Asr, 2 raka'a Isha. Not 4. In Mina, because this is Hajj. One year, Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, he was the Khalifa, he prayed 4 raka'a. Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud was very angry. He said, this is not the Sunnah. This is wrong. When the Salah came, he prayed behind him, and he prayed 4 raka'a. So, his companions told him, why you say wrong and you pray? He said, because Khilaf is sharr, dispute is evil. I say what is right, but at the end of the day, he's the ruler. He's the Imam. I follow him."
