  "transcript": "is halc from india he's saying that there are people who justify dealing in stocks and shares of companies by saying that if it is um 10 in this 5 in that 30 percent in financing by haram loans then it's permissible and he's saying is there any uh legitimacy to that to my knowledge no what is haram is haram if a company is dealing in haram even in small percentages what justifies me to take my money which was halal earned and give it to that company to become a partner and a shareholder with them approving their financing in riba approving in their wrong dealings and haram transactions there isn't anything that is pushing me or forcing me to do that except the love of money and wanting to become richer and uh to increase my wealth which is not a legitimate reason and allah knows best"
