  "title": "Asking AI To Make Living Images Haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Say it from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So, my question is about, so, you know, in the modern age we have a lot of tools, especially things like A.I. and they can do a lot of things including like making images where you write a prompt and like an A.I. algorithm makes an image for you. My question is, if asking an A.I., I guess, a robot to do this and create an image for you, would this also make it haram for you because you are creating images that might include things like animals and humans? Jazak Allahu Khairan Wa Jazakum Of course, it is haram, Akhi. It is like, exactly like me giving someone money and asking him to do haram. So, what's the difference? Artificial intelligence is a program or whatever that creates whatever I ask it to do. Maybe I did not put all the data and information in it myself, but it's there. So, if I say, okay, if I press this button, it's going to play me a song. I didn't play the song. It's the button. Or if I say, hey, Siri, I hope, okay, let me stop this because my iPhone would probably respond. If I said, Alexa, do this or do that, who gave the instruction? Who gave the order? Me. So, whatever is going to play with the Quran or music, whatever the AI is going to do for you, a nice calligraphy of Arabic, beautiful words and poetry or an image of a person, a living person. I am the one who gave the instruction. So, I'm the one who's going to be sinful for that as if I drew it myself with my own hands. Thanks for watching."
