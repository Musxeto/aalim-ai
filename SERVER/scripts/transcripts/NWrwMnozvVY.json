  "transcript": "Benjamin from Bosnia so um if a person was a false Muslim in the past in the sense of uh believing in Allah and his Messengers his books and angels the day of judgment but he didn't but they didn't pray fast give zaka and avoided Haram if that person became an actual Muslim okay says Islam with your line is breaking bamin so if a person now becomes a Muslim what is the question okay ABD Ben Benjamin's question was about someone who was negligent in the past and now he became a practicing Muslim I think he would have most likely asked should he make up for the the past salats and the answer is no because the time is gone he should rep repent feel remorseful uh ask Allah for forgiveness and pledge not to do it again if he if his question was should he say the shahada again to come into Islam the answer is again no because he was Muslim on the surface the true identity whether he's a cafir or not was not labeled was not established and because he was not exited from the fold of Islam and he was not labeled as a cafir then he remains as a Muslim and he goes on from there"
