  "title": "Is inviting Maulanas to recite Quran in a gathering for New House & Birthday Permissible in Islam?",
  "transcript": "Abdul Hamid from the UK question is basically around reciting the Quran in a gathering a brother sent me an invitation that he wants me to join the group of Imam from our local Masjid to recite the Quran together so I asked him what is the purpose he said it's for two things number one um he just moved to a new house and he wanted to recite Quran and number two it is it's gonna be his birthday so I replied to him that I won't be able to I would reject his invitation because of he wants to recite Quran for birthday and secondly I can't sit in a gathering where everyone take or a portion of the Quran and recites all together and I advise him that it is better if one person recites and everybody listen and we can all all um learning from that and also because you're doing it for a birthday I won't be attending so I just want to check with you if um expressions like this it's okay uh you know would it not be that I'm being too extreme in my view or is this something Islam permit or prohibit okay first of all the concept of inviting mawlana to a new house to make Dua to read the Quran is prevailing in the subcontinent and I've seen this myself and this is not part of the Sunnah it's not recommended yes mawlana's are going to hate me because they make a lot of money they invite two or three mawlanas so-called to make Dua and most likely it's in Arabic and people say I mean I mean they don't know what's happening they read a little of the Quran then they have some food and then they get some gift as money or whatever this is not part of the Sunnah yes they're making money out of it but you're seeking Baraka through the wrong way also having this as a birthday celebrating birthday is totally prohibited in Islam it's imitating the disbelievers and it's not part of our uh religion or Sharia and it was never done by the Companions and the tabien and tabir tabern so this is totally prohibited you're doing the right thing by telling your friend not to do it and by refraining from attending such Gatherings and Allah Knows Best foreign"
