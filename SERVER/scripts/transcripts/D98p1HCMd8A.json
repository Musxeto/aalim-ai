  "transcript": "next question Dr Zakir is uh what is the ruling on the one who commits suicide and furthermore what can the parents do to reduce the punishment of the one who has committed suicide as far as suicide is concerned we discussed earlier that it is one of the major sins according to Imam adhabi in his book alabar he put suicide as number 29th in the list of 70 and Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 195 make not your own hands the cause of your destruction indicating very clearly that suicide is prohibited in Islam and there are various had which speak about this it's mentioned in s bukari volume number 7 Hadith number 5778 where the Beloved Prophet M sallam he said that whoever throws himself from the mountain and falls and dies he will keep on falling perpetually in the Hellfire forever and if a person drinks poison and dies he will keep on in the hell have a bottle of poison and keep on drinking it and keep on dying in the hell and if someone stabs himself then in the Hellfire he'll keep on stabbing himself forever and again Allah messenger repeats the message in say bukari volume number 8 Hadith number 6047 where the Beloved Prophet wasallam said that if a person commits suicide and kills himself in the Hellfire he'll keep on doing that same act he'll be found in the same way in the hell the same way he killed himself he will have the same action done in the hell and the Beloved Prophet Mall said it's mentioned s bukari volume number four Hadith number 3463 that there was a person who had a wound and it was pinning him too much he was impatient so he takes a knife and he cuts his hand and then he bleeds to death and the prophet he says that because he was impatient and he killed himself he will not enter paradise and a similar Hadith is mentioned in say Muslim volume number two in the book of Salah Hadith number 2133 that a person was bought to the prophet who had killed himself with a broad-headed spear and he had committed suicide he was bought to the prophet so the prophet did not read his Jan Salah from here we come to know that it is a major sin but that doesn't mean when we come to know further we come to know that the other sahabas did read the J Salah it doesn't mean that if a person who commits suicide has done sh it's not the biggest sin in Islam it is a major sin it is a big sin but it does not t amount to kuf and if Allah wishes and pleases he may forgive him as Allah says in the Quran in Surah 4:48 and Surah 4 vers 116 if Allah pleases he may forgive any sin but the sin of sh he'll never forgive so that the reason in such cases when person who commits suicide it's a major sin every Muslim should be discouraged but if he does that they are the Muslims they should pray for him pray for his M for forgiveness and and similarly as the question what should the parent do of a person who has committed suicide so the parent should pray to Allah subhana wa tala to forgive their child if he has committed suicide and inshallah Allah is Rahman or and if Allah pleases he may forgive"
