مُّبِينًا بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم، الحمد لله رب العالمين، وأصلي وأسلم على المبعوث رحمة للعالمين، نبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين، أما بعد Dear brothers and sisters in Islam, السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام dealt with mistakes and errors and with people's sins according to what the outcome would be the best and it's not one size that fits all so sometimes he used to be a little bit strict and harsh sometimes he was soft sometimes he expressed his anger sometimes he dealt with it in a very calm way and and as students of knowledge and truth seekers we have to adapt such methodology when we deal with such mistakes and errors of people's because no one is perfect and definitely we do not want to avenge ourselves or to score a point or to prove that we're right rather we would like to have the best outcome we would like to bring that individual who fell in that mistake back to the right and straight path and this can only be done when we study the biography and the seerah of the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام and this is a very very important and crucial point in perfecting our behavior Allah says you Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم are in a very high standard of ethics and moral conduct and this is from Allah عز و جل so in order to reach that level we have to study how the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم reacted and act accordingly one of the means or ways of the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and this was almost prevailing in all of his dealings with mistakes and errors remaining calm when dealing with people's mistakes especially if and when being too harsh could make matters worse and do more harm than good if you go through and scan the prophet's biography عليه الصلاة والسلام you would be amazed by his character you'd fall in love with him and that would be at first sight he was not the type of person who was impulsive who said things and retracted it like many of us he's not a person who would shoot first and ask questions when he walks he doesn't look around and doesn't look stable and calm and manly rather he walks in a steady pace fast but doesn't look around doesn't look like he's not stable when he speaks you can count the words that he utters unlike us when someone asks you a question you just burst into a lecture okay wait wait stop i didn't want this i just wanted a yes or no answer the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم used to have the concise of speech which meant that he thought more than he spoke he contemplated much much more than he acted and this is why all of his actions are precisely calculated and the outcome of them would always be to the best of results never ever you've gone through his seerah to find him doing things and regretting it صلى الله عليه وسلم rather it's all highlighting his character as a calm peaceful individual generally speaking but when the tough gets when the going gets tough the tough gets going it's a different person he acts according to what is needed and this is how the scholars defined wisdom what is wisdom when do we say that this person is wise or not wisdom is putting things things in the right place knowing when to act and this is what the prophet was عليه الصلاة والسلام he used to act in a calm way because he weighs the consequences and hadith we mentioned before and we should mention all the time because it is a beautiful incidence that highlights how we should behave and there are so many lessons to be learned from it the hadith of the bedouin of the nomad who came into the masjid and he made dua some say he made dua before the incident some say he made dua after the incident he said oh allah have mercy upon me and muhammad and don't have mercy upon anyone else and the prophet heard this so suddenly he smiled and he said allah's mercy is so huge and wide and you've limited it only to the two of us that's not a nice thing that's not a nice thing a while later while the prophet was with his companions talking in the masjid of medina the man started to urinate it was established well established in the souls of the companions that this is inappropriate that these masjids are not a place for such heinous acts filthy acts so they all wanted to go and attack the man to prevent him from urinating in the masjid the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam sallallahu alaihi wa sallam with his insight with his knowledge knew that there were only two courses of action one that the man would be stopped and that had two end results either he would succeed in stopping and that would physically medically harm him or they would fail in stopping him which would startle him which would make him maybe try to run away causing urine to smear his own body clothes and spread all over the masjid instead of being contained in one spot so this is course number one the second course of action would be to leave him alone and that is an evil act however it is the lesser of the two evils because now the urine would be limited in a specific area that can be easily cleaned and washed off and the man's clothes and body would not be soiled with such impurity so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam on the spot came to this conclusion and this shows you how you as a da'i should make calculations in a split of a second weighing the pros and the cons and this is part of common sense and logic but it's also part of studying the fundamentals of fiqh that shows you how to think refrains your thought process and improves it most if not all lawyers even in kafir countries have studied usul al fiqh because it is part of their job to evaluate situations to weigh the pros and cons to know the ins and outs so when defining a problem and addressing it there are no loopholes so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam reached that conclusion and he said to the people when they started or attempted to stop him he said leave him alone and throw a bucket of water over it you have been sent to make things easy for people not to make things hard wow i could argue with this oh prophet of allah yes we are made or we were sent to make things easy for people but this guy is doing what he's doing it's an evil act in the masjid you're not still seeing the bigger picture and this is why sometimes we fail big time in giving dawah we fail when we do not recognize the consequences of our actions or the hurtful impact our words have upon others yes sometimes we have to hurt people i'm a surgeon i have to cut people up i'm a dentist i have to extract teeth and does this make me the villain no this is what wisdom is putting the things the things in the right places and that's what i was doing generally speaking you do not do that before you weigh the pros and the cons so the prophet highlighted the fact you were sent or you were sent to make things easy for people and not to make things hard subhanallah we should have these words resonate whenever we give dawah make things easy for people now when we say make things easy doesn't mean that you make haram things halal it doesn't ever mean that free mixing is fine listening to music is fine sitting with people in-laws and relatives who consume haram it's okay make things easy no there are red lines mother aisha highlighted this when she said may allah be pleased with her the prophet was never given the choice between two things except that he would choose the easiest of them unless there is haram if there is haram in one of them he would be the furthest person away from it so if there are two things that are halal always pick the easiest for the people don't be hard upon yourself i got a question i think today maybe so i don't know where maybe twitter a person says before the break of dawn sometimes we drink water mixed with some herbs and these herbs help us not to feel thirsty during the daytime so should i do this or is it more rewardable for me to refrain from mixing the water with such herbs so that i would feel the thirst and hence get more reward from allah subhanallah you were not sent to make things hard for people why do you think that allah wants to torture you that allah wants you to feel thirsty if this is the case don't drink water the whole day you'll feel more thirsty doesn't make any sense at all allah doesn't want us to harm ourselves or kill ourselves otherwise and this happens you see people performing hajj walking there are cars there are buses no no no no we want to walk under the sun so we may get a heat stroke and that would be better for our reward who said so allah doesn't want you to harm yourself when the prophet saw a man alayhis salatu wasalam doing this and he asked who's this they said he took a vow upon himself not to sit in the shade and not to ride the prophet told him alayhis salatu wasalam shade him and make him right allah doesn't want you to kill yourselves or harm yourselves so again using the best of methods to weigh the pros and cons and to do the lesser of the two evils is part of how we deal with those who make sins and mistakes and errors what did the prophet say alayhis salatu wasalam pour a bucket of water pour a bucket of water and again this helps those with the OCD when they come to the issue of purity and impurities the man's urine could not exceed 200 milliliters it would have been less so this is an impurity and it's in the gravel and sand and pebbles the prophet ordered them to pour a bucket of water which is probably two liters so the ratio is approximately one to ten if you have one drop of urine some people think that this drop of urine smears and soils the whole house the bed sheet the blankets the sofa the carpets the walls one drop of urine or mazhi and shaitan starts cooking things in their heads the prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam pour a bucket of water problem is solved so 10 drops of clean water over a drop of urine this is sufficient to dilute it and make it pure pure so look at how shaitan works with people when they wash themselves from impurity someone who finished urinating and excuse my language and there's nothing coming out and he washes his or her private part they overwhelm the area with water there is way more than the ratio of 10 to 1 if they were few drops one or two drops on the private part they pour like half a liter and definitely this overwhelms it yet still shaitan messes up with their head oh what about the splashes what about what runs on my thighs or on my hands or i get this feeling of this and that the whole area is clean it is overwhelmed with pure water you cannot identify or locate any of the impurities that were there one or two drops of urine it's gone but shaitan messes up with their head so the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam directed them to what and how to deal with such impurities and how to deal with a situation when we have two evils how to do and how to select and how to select the lesser of the two evils again this has to be governed by the rules of sharia whether the lesser of the two evil would negatively impact me when i can change this as well or not so i'm invited to attend a family gathering and i go and there is free mixing there is haram being done and committed or consumed there's music and i say to myself if i leave this might break the ties of kinship and they may be offended and if i stay this is the lesser of the two evils no it's not true you're committing a sin by sitting and the lesser of the two evils if they were to be committing it and not harming you but you're the one who's listening to music you're the one who's sitting on a table that people are drinking intoxicants and the prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam whoever believes in allah in the day of judgment must not sit on a table where others consume intoxicants so even if it's a business lunch or business dinner or an important meeting and someone drinks haram whether it's beer or whiskey or wine you cannot sit there oh shaykh but the lesser of the two evils no this is evil by itself that is negatively impacting you run you have to leave you have to denounce this and leave and not sit so again that this all boils down to your knowledge of the sharia of different incidents that took place when to draw the line and say this cannot continue or when can you tolerate and say yes the evil is far far less than if i were to do this or if i were to do that this is according to your judgment and according to the rules of engagement if you wish of how to denounce the munkar the evil and the vice and allah azza wa jal knows best you you"
