  "transcript": "Zaynuddin from the UK. Now, from knowledge we know that gold, pure gold, is impermissible for men. Correct? Correct. So, now I wanted to ask, are we allowed to use, what about rose gold? It's a form of gold. It's pure gold, but it's mixed with copper. So, it's an alloy. Now, we know wearing gold is impermissible, but can we use the rose gold in using it, buying in pens, using certain pieces, certain accessories, for example, buying in pens, for example, because they sell rose gold pens. So, am I allowed to use the rose gold stuff, knowing it's mixed with pure gold or copper? I wanted to ask because, would it change the state of the pure gold to a different form, and not actually pure gold, since it's mixed with something else? To my knowledge, pure gold is not available except in bars, or in like 99.99 grams of blocks of gold that cannot be molded into a key chain or a pen or the likes, because it's too pure. It has to be mixed with copper so that it can be molded and used in other cases. Therefore, the answer is no. Rose gold is haram because it's gold mixed with other ingredients, and it is widely used in all aspects. Cufflinks and pens and key holders and watches and all of this is haram."
