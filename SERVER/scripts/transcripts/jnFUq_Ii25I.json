  "title": "Forced to do Dua & Dhikr  in congregation? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "from Australia if you remember my question on Twitter which was regarding how my school makes the students to congregation with the Grand in the morning and how they make us all stand up where I don't participate but they say that at least I must stand up then you replied that if they forced me to stand up then it's okay if I hate it in my heart so I just needed some clarification which is uh what what do you exactly mean by force like does it mean me being on the verge of being suspended or expelled by the school because all I did is I talked to the hills and they just told me no I must stand up and the biggest threat that they gave me is that they will take this issue to the principal if I continue to disobey then I didn't talk to them after that so can you just clarify by what you meant by force okay you are studying in a foreign country and most likely the school that you're studying in they follow a deviant sect and they don't know anything better to them as an authority you are breaking their rules and you are rebellious and you're encouraging other students to follow you in defying their instructions to me as long as you've done your due diligence and you told him that this is a bit an innovation and still they believe it is not and they're forcing you to stand up this is a trivial issue that does not require putting up a big fight or to be sent to detention or to have your parents come and sign pledging that you would not do that again Etc you don't want to do problems and trouble that may impact your studies so I believe that it is not of that importance to put up a fight with such an issue stand up and don't recite the Dua as they uh are all doing and inshaallah there is nothing on you and Allah Knows Best"
