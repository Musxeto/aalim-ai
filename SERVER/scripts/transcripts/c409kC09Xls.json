  "transcript": "Shrug your shoulders and move on without paying any attention. Arsalan from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum, Sheikh. So, I'm confused about laymen reading the Quran. I haven't studied hadith sciences, though I know Arabic. I know that when I don't understand something, I should ask a Sheikh. Now, my problem is when I think I understand an ayah, but I do not. For example, in the ayah, Inna al-Fajraka'ana mashhooda I thought it meant that all Quran recited during the time of Fajr has an extra degree of witnessing, but I was wrong, and it's only the Quran reciting during the prayer. I'm not too worried about being misguided by the Quran like the Khawarij were, because I don't think I would go to that extreme because I don't completely reject the Sunnah. I just lack knowledge, and there might be a hadith somewhere that I don't know, but it makes my interpretation correct. But of course, Quran being divine speech, when we read it in its original form, it doesn't just go in one ear and go out the next, but our brains have to interpret it one way or another. About interpreting wrong and inventing lies about Allah, when we read an ayah and we think we understand it. Okay, what's the question? What should I do? It's very simple. Read the Quran, and to the best of your ability, whatever you understand, Allah Azza wa Jal will reward you. Never ever think for a second or a millisecond, that Allah Azza wa Jal is just waiting for you to slip, and then throw you into hell. This is ridiculous. Allah's beautiful names are 99, as mentioned in the hadith, as minimum. And it can go up to Allah's knowledge. Allah knows how many, but this is what we were told. And among them is the most forgiving, the most merciful, the one who guides people to repent, the one who accepts repentance from them. So he's the Ghaffar, Al-Ghafoor, Al-Rahman, Al-Raheem, Al-Tawwab. Why do you neglect all of these names and insist that, whoops, he's waiting for me to give me a good whipping? No, Allah Azza wa Jal is most merciful. So you read his divine words that he revealed, so that you read them and learn from them. To the best of your ability, you're going to be safe 99%, because it is in Arabic and it's very easy to comprehend and learn. Maybe there is one or two incidents and cases that you misunderstood, because there was a different interpretation to it. And this is not a big mistake. The Companions themselves, may Allah be pleased with them, went to the Prophet ï·º and said to him, that we have transgressed against ourselves and Allah Azza wa Jal told us that whoever does this will be thrown in hell. And the Prophet said, no, this is not how you understood it correctly. You misunderstood it. Allah said in Surah Luqman, Shirk is great transgression. This is the type of transgression. If you fall into, you're going to be thrown in hell. Not any kind of sins or minor or major sins and the likes. So even the Companions had this understanding and made that mistake, but it is forgiven with the grace of Allah."
