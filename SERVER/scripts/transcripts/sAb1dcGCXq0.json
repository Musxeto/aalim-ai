  "transcript": "um east side from denmark if i have a small amount of urine on my leg do i need to wash it with water or can i clean it with toilet paper okay i will answer inshallah if a person has an impurity other than his private parts so if someone has a drop of urine on his foot on his leg on his thigh is it sufficient to wipe it with toilet paper the answer is no you have to wash it with water wiping it is not enough with toilet paper unless the toilet paper has water in itself and the water would overwhelm that little spot"
