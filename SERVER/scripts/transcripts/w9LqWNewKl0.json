  "transcript": "Fuad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu How are you Sheikh? I'm fine Alhamdulillah So Sheikh, can we pray behind an Imam who believes that Allah is everywhere? Barak Allah Fi Hayatik Those who believe that Allah is everywhere definitely are against the teachings of the Qur'an, the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salaam and the Aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah starting with the Companions, the Tabi'een and Tabi'at Tabi'een and most likely such people have misunderstanding of the texts of the Qur'an and of the Sunnah due to either their ignorance or pure misunderstanding and following their Imams So such people like Asha'ir or Maturidiya and the likes who say that Allah is everywhere and that Allah is not on his throne definitely are in great and huge mistake which is sinful by no doubt however the scholars say that we do not get them out of the fold of Islam due to the fact that there is something blocking their Takfir and that is their misunderstanding or Ta'weel so misinterpreting or understanding the issues of Alistiwa and the likes blocks us from giving them Takfir yet it does not stop us from saying that they are committing a grave mistake and a sin that has to be rectified and Allah knows best so in short yes you can pray behind them Inshallah"
