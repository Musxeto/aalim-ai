  "transcript": "I've been married for 40 years. If anyone asks me about my wife's shortcomings or flaws, I say she hasn't any. What's the emotion you find hardest to express? The love to the Prophet ﷺ because you just can't control your emotions when you talk about him. My life is my life. Don't look at me as a celebrity. You mentioned that you go to the gym often and we all know about the viral picture and your reply to it. Are you still gyming daily? I do gym four to five times a week. My father died when I was like 14 years of age, 15 years of age. As-salamu alaykum and welcome to episode 358 of Freshly Grounded. This episode is brought to you by Train with Gaff. A lot of us struggle with nutrition. I know that's the case for me.

And get your hands on the key nutritional information we need as Muslims to make sure that we stay healthy and fit. And with that being said, let's get into this very exciting episode of Freshly Grounded with Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim. Alhamdulillah. JazakAllah khair for giving me your time. BarakAllahu feekum for having me. Talk about time. How do you manage your time, Sheikh? Because the output that you have, Allahumma barak is amazing. There's constantly, whether it's not Twitter or YouTube, Instagram, there's always something coming out in regards to your answers. I know that you recently kind of mentioned that there's some volunteer sisters, may Allah bless them, who you've never met, who have taken on board the YouTube and the Instagram, and you kind of focus on the Twitter, but that seems like you have an amazing system running around you so that you can constantly output at that level. Bismillah alhamdulillah, salatu wa salamu ala Rasulillahi wa alihi wa sahbihi wa min ihthatha bihudahu, amma ba'd. I'd be lying if I said that, well, I manage my time by putting a plan and a strategy and all of this baloney is not true. I do not manage time. It is Allah who puts barakah in your time. And I'm always feeling that I'm not doing enough, first of all. Second of all, what I do is not something that I could brag about and say that I'm doing it and I'm prioritizing things and I'm putting things in perspective. And this and that, again, this is not true. Whatever comes, I do it. And I do have a lot of spare time on my plate that you'll be surprised. But people don't know this. And it makes me feel really tiny and small when I compare myself and my spare time to real scholars who devoted their lives and times and wealth and health for the sake of Allah. Seriously, I'm not saying this out of being confused. I'm not saying this out of being humble. I'm the last one to be humble. Seriously, because I brag a lot and I know what to brag about. And I know that a lot of people are nothing compared to me. But when push comes to shove, I know that I'll be held accountable on the Day of Judgment big time for the time I've been wasting. And comparing my blessings and favors that Allah has bestowed upon me. And the blessings that He has bestowed upon me to real scholars. I think I'm doomed. Nevertheless, I have great hope in Allah and in His forgiveness and in His mercy that I managed to get by. But I don't plan anything. If people come and invite me to a conference on XYZ month, I said this is too late. Call me two weeks. Okay. Because I do not know how to plan. More than that. I don't know what comes up. You don't use any calendar apps? Nothing. Nothing. So you tell me we want you in August. I said, call me two weeks before August. Oh, we have to organize it till now. I don't have anything. I don't know what's going to come up. So call me two weeks before the actual event because I don't plan anything ahead of time. And what about your phone? Are you good? How do you manage your relationship with your phone in terms of... Because I know a lot of your communication is done over email. So do you purposely try and distance yourself from anybody like having people from a lot of people having your number and access to WhatsApp and things like this? I pride myself to answer any caller any time of the day and night when I'm free. And like three, four years ago, that was 23 hours a day. The phone was always on. I have only one number. And if I'm eating, if I'm working out. You know, I'm working out. If I'm in the gym, if I am driving, I'm always on. I answer people to the extent that my family may feel irritated. And come on, we're sitting with you. I said, okay. It's only a minute or two. I don't take long calls where people vent. But I was going to say, how do you make sure people don't take the mic? Because first of all, I give each caller one call a day. And it must not exceed four to five minutes. And I have a good memory in who called. And I can remember voices. So if someone calls twice a day, I say, listen, next time you do it, I'm going to block your number. And I have hundreds of numbers blocked. So usually, like we're having this conversation, my phone is on do not disturb. So you call, you'll find that it's giving you a busy tone. But if I don't have counseling sessions, if I'm not doing anything of importance, it's always on. Okay. So you mentioned that you're comparing your time to the time that some other scholars. There's this thought that I've had actually a lot, which is that sometimes what goes through my mind when I think about my time and how I'm using it. And kind of similar to what you were saying, but on a much worse scale. I often think about this. This thought came into my mind a couple of years ago. And I haven't been able to shake it off since I had it. And I regularly think about it. And the thought is, is essentially. That we have the same Lord. As I have the same Lord as the scholars will be questioned by the same Lord. And I have got the same 24 hours in a day. And so sometimes I will limit myself and think, if I can achieve this in my lifetime to do with the Dean. If I could achieve X in my lifetime. Let me just try and get to that. And then I remember that there's scholars who have done so much. Memorized like new libraries of books. Implemented and taught many people. And then I think to myself, actually, considering we have the same, I'm going to be, there's not going to be, I will be like a separate Lord answering, asking questions to the scholars and then a separate for me. So if that's the case, I should actually have that aspiration of actually trying to achieve that. And so a question I actually had for you noted down for later on in the podcast, but I'll ask it now because we spoke about it is. I just showed you a turtle, right? And through the work that I do with turtle team, we hear from a lot of. Huffaz, especially on like, we have this podcast, this podcast where Huffaz call in and a lot of the Huffaz we asked them like, what was your Hith journey like? And a lot of them say, well, my, my mom started me on my Hith journey when I was five or four and I memorized Quran when I, by the time I was 12, 15, 20, you very rarely hear somebody say I started at 30 and I, you know, memorized by 35 or 40. So for people who are later on in life, maybe then their thirties now or forties, and they haven't necessarily started memorizing where they haven't, they're not even a half. What, how would you motivate them? And what. Positive thing can we explain to them that helps them feel that they can still aspire to be on the try and become a scholar? For example, first of all, you know that I do counseling sessions. Yes. Yes. Just paid for that. Yes. I do. This is what I've seen the website. Yeah. This is what puts the bread on the table with the grace of Allah. Azawajal. I sit with a lot of couples who may vent to me and complain that the kids are not doing enough in Hifz Quran. And they're trying to. Beat them up, trying to motivate them, try to. And I said to him, listen, we cannot have clones of scholars. Otherwise, if everyone was a scholar, nobody would drive the bus. Nobody would collect the garbage. Nobody would administer this or that, or be in finance or be a doctor or be an engineer. Therefore, each one is designated to what Allah Azawajal had made him capable of. And. He can be the best in what he does. Not necessarily memorize the Quran. There are many scholars that I can name who had zero impact on their people and their community. That I or others may think of us, of ourselves to be better to the community than them, because we managed to change so many people's lives with the grace of Allah. What we. Don't know is that we thrived on their books. And we've learned from them what enabled us to impact others. So they're getting rewarded, even if they did not have the impact we have on communities and societies and those close to us. So each one is created and facilitated to what Allah Azawajal has preordained for him. The Hadith of the Prophet . Praising those in the Muslim army. Saying, For a soldier of Allah Azawajal in the army. If they put him up front to fight the enemies, he's fine. If they put him the leadership at the back doing nothing but to collect leftovers of the army what they felt, what things that was lost or to find those who were left behind and cater for them. It's not a fight. fighting position, Tuba for him, so good for him. So, this Hadith shows us that if you have the sincerity, you don't have to be a Hafif, you don't have to be an orator or a Da'i. We can't be clones of one another. We all can't be Dr. Zakir Naik, knowing the Surah, knowing the Ayah, having the ability to counter atheists and other faiths with confidence and knowledge, mashallah. We can't be like this. We need different people in different positions. Therefore, look at your son, look at your daughter, look at their potentials and invest in what they love and like so that they excel in what they do. Of course, there are red lines we don't cross. So, prayer on time, doing your Rauza or fasting, as you guys say, and the likes. Okay, this is the basics. The more you can do is good, but don't make that a breaking point that may let them feel despair and say, the heck with it. I'm leaving the whole thing, the whole wagon and jumping out of it. No. Give them motivation. Look what they can really perform in and try to balance. I don't know if this sounds logical. No, no. It makes it all right. It makes it all right. It makes it all right. It makes a lot of sense because like you like you've already kind of mentioned, we all have different skills and assets and different things we can bring to the Umar, right? So, it makes a lot of sense what you're saying and adds a kind of another layer of thought to it. I actually wanted to start the podcast in a bit of a different way initially, but I wanted to ask you but I ended up asking you by the time. So, we'll go to that now. So, we have this, we create these conversation cards at Freshly Grounded. It's called, we just called it the Freshly Grounded game. And so, you've actually got a pack there for you to take home as well. So, I've picked out some questions from the game that I want to ask you. Answer them as short or as long as you'd like. It's meant to be fairly quick, but I thought it would help break some of the ice considering this, the first time we've ever met is happening on camera. So, it's a bit harder to break the ice, right? So, I'm relying on the game for this one. So, we'll go with this one first. When was the last time that you decluttered your life? I did what? You decluttered your life. What is that? You removed things from your life whether it be from mental space or just had to clear out of your house or you decluttered, you minimized, you removed things. I don't have anything as such with the grace of Allah. I live in the bare minimum. I don't have anything that plugs my system, not even in home. I don't buy things and just look at them or I have problems in my life that I have to remove. I'm a very simple day-to-day person. I don't plan for the future. I'm just wasting for my SMS to answer my Lord and die and I enjoy day-to-day life. I go to the gym. I enjoy sitting with my kids, my grandkids. There's nothing that makes me... I can't get sleep at night. Yes. I just turn off the switch and... Alhamdulillah. Do you think that's something that you've been blessed with or this kind of like thick skin or the ability to switch off? Because some people are quite sensitive to things that happen around them and then can easily lose sleep. I, I believe I am quite blessed by Allah in every single aspect of life. Seriously, if you say to me, Shaykh, are you a millionaire? I said, no. A thousandaire? I said, no. I don't have a house. I don't have a property. I don't have plots. I pay rent for two houses. I've been doing this all of my life. I don't have any investments. I live day-to-day a very lavish life with the grace of Allah. My kids never miss anything. But, I'm blessed in every single aspect. Maybe, this is due to that Allah has blessed me to have trust on Him. So, even if the worst thing happens, immediately, I just snap out of it and say, it was preordained 50,000 years before Allah created the universe. Nothing I could have done to change it. Salafi, move on. Yes, but He did this to you. They did that to you. You've lost your job. You've lost... So what? Allah preordained it. What can you do? If my son dies, I don't have sons, alhamdulillah. They're all daughters. I have only sons, alhamdulillah. So, if my son dies, I have one of two choices. Bang your head against the wall, cry, weep, tear your clothes and complain. My son is not going to come back to life. Or, I can be patient, saddened, may cry a little bit, but be content, Allahumma lak alhamd. My son is not going to come back to life again. The difference is the reward at the sight of Allah. So, might as well be content. Shazakallahu khair. Next question. Do you find it easy to apologize? Very. Did you? Yeah. But, alhamdulillah, 95% of the time, you're right. It's not I'm right. I'm very aware of people's feelings. So, I try my level best not to offend them unless I'm doing it willingly. And in 99.9%, I do it willingly. Meaning, the guy is OCD. Fine, so you have to. I have to step on his stomach. Yes. And jump, jump, jump until he vomits. Yeah. People around me say, this is too harsh. This is none of your business. He's my patient. I know I'm doing it. And the people that come to me with the grace of Allah know that I don't have any beef with them. I don't have any hidden agenda. I don't want to show that I am better than them. I am better than them. Sue me. What am I going to do? They know that Sheikh Asim wants the best to us. And he's treating us as a father, as a friend, as a counselor. So, whatever he says, he does not intend to degrade us or to put us down. That's interesting. I want to touch a bit more on that later. Tell me something about your father that you didn't appreciate until you became older. My father died when I was like 14 years of age, 15 years of age. So that was almost, almost a lot. I mean, a long time ago, almost 50 years ago. And I have very little recollection of him. And what I know is that I never shared any feelings with, to him or with him. This is how he is. He was, he was excellent with everybody else, with friends, very sociable, very well known in the community. He was an editor of two newspapers, in Arabic and English. So he was multilingual and everybody loved him. I rarely saw him. So I have no emotions in the sense that hugging, kissing and the likes, and this cascaded. To me, not being able to show such feelings to my kids in the sense of, they desire me hugging them, but no, dad, why are you hugging us? I said, I don't know. It's not me. I try to force myself to do this and kiss them and to, you know, cuddle them. And, you know, often what psychologists say about, about that is that if that's not the way you show love, that's probably because that's not the way you receive love. So if, for example, your daughters give you a cuddle, not to say that you don't receive that as a form of love, but as in, there might be something else that you really appreciate, that someone does for you. And that's how you receive that love. And so, you know, you feel love when somebody does that for you. So like that could be, for example, that somebody does an act of service, like make sure that you're well and that you're fed and stuff like that. I always, you know, the thing is I always gaslight them. Okay. And when they say, well, you don't hug us. Why don't you hug us? Like we hug you. Give us some affection. I said, yeah, because I don't love you. You know, I don't care for you. I said, and start defending me. No, you give us this, you give us that. So I said, okay, you can continue. So, ah, what do you think? I think it's for you though. How do you receive love? That way? What would somebody do that makes you feel loved? If it's not hugs and like affection in that sense, like physical affection, so could it be gifts, acts of service, um, as somebody being an opening? I would the grace of, no, no. With the grace of, of Allah, I never ever expect things from others. Okay. So whatever my wife does, whatever my kids do or my grandchildren do, I appreciate it. Whether it's a, an expression of love or they're just doing it because it's their duty. I appreciate that big time. And I never show them that I'm missing something or you guys didn't call me. You didn't come to visit. You don't give me gifts. You don't send me flowers. And if they do, Hamdulillah, if they, if they don't, I'm fine, but I love them and I express my love through giving them gifts, trying to do things to them. They understand and they know, but you know, people are greedy. They want the extra edge. Yeah. It sounds like you're good at, um, overlooking, uh, which is a very, very important power. I do. I do overlook miss people's mistakes. I, I pretend not to have seen them. So this is what I say to people. I've been married for 40 years. If anyone asks, me about my wife's shortcomings or flaws, I say, she hasn't any, she doesn't have any, she's perfect. Of course he's not. If I were to think about it, maybe I would have come up with a hundred. And if she were to be asked, she would say the same. He doesn't have any, he's the perfect husband, but I know my short, uh, comings and flaws. This is content. We are the happiest. Couple because we love one another with the grace of Allah. And our relationship is based on respect. It's based on compassion and trying not to be selfish, to do whatever you can. Yes. Maybe I don't buy her red roses. I don't take her to a dinner at restaurants and, and, and then do things, uh, as such. But she knows that no one loves his wife more than I do. And I know that no one loves her husband more than she does. It's interesting that you said that you are kind of selfless in that manner. Um, we had Sheikh Mohammed, Tim Humble on the podcast, um, sometime back and he said something that stuck with me to this day. He said that, um, if a husband, and really he's, he said, this is beneficial for any relationship, but if a husband is constantly, he said, what we find often in relationships is that a person is trying to get his rights and she is trying to get her rights. And he said, if you're both concerned with each other's rights and not of yours, that's the best type of relationship. And actually you both get your right, get given your rights in that process as well. So true kind of, um, yeah, beneficial. Just okay. Okay. Um, who do you appreciate more as you get older? Definitely Allah Azza wa Jal for all what he has bestowed upon me. I can't appreciate him enough or thank him or show my gratitude to him. As for humans, my wife is, um, my rock. So I do appreciate everything she does for me and for the kids and how tolerant she is. You're good. You're good. You've read this. Yeah. Um, one of our laws names is you're protecting friend or transit. So you're protecting family. Name a time in your life where you felt that name in existence. Every time 24 hours, seven days a week. Name one thing you love about the way you've been raised. Allah raised me and no one else. Seriously. Nobody sat with me, reprimanded me, guided me, told me, scald me. It's Allah Azza wa Jal that has blessed me of being able to diagnose, analyze, uh, trial and error and, and fix things in myself to become who I am with the grace of Allah. No, no one has any, alhamdulillah, yeah, any white hands on me except Allah. So, um, describe your ultimate cheat meal. My ultimate cheat meal. Cheat meal? Yeah. I don't, uh, um, I'm not faithful in any meals. I always cheat. Well, you, uh, long bet if you mentioned that you go to the gym often, uh, uh, we all know about the viral picture and your reply to it. Uh, so, so, um, then you must be on diet, Sheikh, let's be honest. Come on. You don't, you didn't hear from me. I ate pizzas. I ate cheeseburgers. I adore steaks, uh, shawarmas all the time. It's sweet stuff, sweet stuff. Um, before I became diabetic. Yes. But now, alhamdulillah, I'm, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm way down. I used to take like two or three bars of chocolate, you know, Mars galaxy with hazelnut or, uh, the likes every single day. And, I used to eat like three cheeseburgers with a liter of, uh, of Coke or Pepsi in one meal. And then hit the gym for four hours. Okay. For four hours, four to five hours. But now I can barely finish one. Are you still doing day? Are you doing daily? When, when I had a meal. Oh, no, now do you gym daily? I do gym four to five times a week. Okay. Alhamdulillah. Morning, evening. No morning. I'm a morning person. I'm a morning person too. Evening. Yeah. And after Asr, it's done. I'm home. I don't function after 8.30 PM. I like to be in bed at nine. After Isha, I don't leave home. Yeah. But I, I do a lot of things until one o'clock AM. Oh really? Yeah. I couldn't. So I, I, my, my sleeping pattern is three hours. Then I have to wake up. Okay. I can't go for more than max four hours a day. Okay. So I have to wake up, sit for two, three hours, then go back to sleep for an hour or so. And then do things for five, six hours and go. So it's, it's just a very weird, awkward, for a retired person, it's just fine. Do you set alarms? Only for, before Fajr. Okay. That's it. Have you any, some people, my technique for my alarm setting is that I set the alarm for Fajr in the other room. So my, I have my house, my office is inside my house. And so my room, my alarm is in my office. And so I have to walk, like, all the way to my office. Alhamdulillah. I don't even snooze my alarm. That worries me. Yeah. The moment it rings, I'm awake. Alhamdulillah. Okay. Tell me an Islamic reminder you once heard that has stayed with you to this day. I'm not good at this. Okay. And it's not one that comes to mind right now. Everything I say is, are gems. So, I'll skip that for now. What's the emotion, the emotion, you find hardest to express? This is, this question was made for you Shaykh. What's the emotion you find hardest to express? The love to the Prophet because you just can't control your emotions when you talk about him. The love we have for our Prophet , the amount of attack, the deviant sects, and those who accuse us of hating him and not loving his Sunnah. Despite the decades we've been trying our level best to call people to the Sunnah and to love the Prophet and to hold him in a great high place to their hearts. Yet they still accuse us that we don't love the Prophet . This is an emotion that you just feel the love and that you would do anything to see him. Okay. And to meet him and to be with him . What's your favorite struggle? It's not my favorite, but it's my struggle with my own fitness and my own self. I like to challenge myself. So, if I lose in a game, I'm very competitive. Oh, really? I enjoy it. What sports do you play? Now... Are you into paddle? No, no, no, no, no. Really? I have two surgeries in both knees. Okay. So, I have won tournaments, with the grace of Allah, in squash. You won tournaments? Yeah, yeah. I used to be very competitive. I have won tournaments in table tennis professionally. Amazing. And badminton, in the 90s, I was very good. But then I torn a cartilage in one of the matches and I stopped since then. But I was very, very good and competitive. And badminton. And yeah, I enjoy these games. Are your injuries from your sports? Yes. Okay. Well, I think people don't necessarily know that you're so into sport, would they? Well, as was before the viral hit. None of their business. It's true. It's not exactly as you said. See, this is what I'm trying to tell people. Akhi, our lives is ours. And if I hit the gym, if I have a good symmetric body, Alhamdulillah, this is for my wife. Why should I tell people about my own personal life? Why should I tell people, oh, I went to this restaurant and I had this fettuccine and I spoke with Shaykh so and so, and look at the sunrise or the sunset. And I don't do these things because what counts is what gets you closer to Allah. My life is my life. Okay. Don't I? I want to brag about the things in my life. Believe me, if I do, people would be totally shocked. I don't because I don't want them to be shocked or to praise me or to say, well, I didn't know you did this or did that because this is my life. It doesn't matter to you. Don't look at me as a celebrity. Learn from what I teach you that gets you closer to Allah. And if I make a mistake, avoid that. My personal life, what I teach you, that gets you closer to Allah. My personal life, what I do in my hobbies, my background, my past, this is my business. Simple as that. I like that. Okay, so on that note, actually, what does a perfect night in look like to you? Every night. Same old same. I wouldn't say that, oh, that was a memorable night. Everything, alhamdulillah, is fine. I have a good meal with my wife and kids. And then I retire to do my questions on the website. I have a good meal with my wife and kids. And then I retire to do my questions on the website. And then I retire to do my questions on the website. And then I retire to do my questions on the website. And then I retire to do my questions on the website. On my website Q&A. And then I just do whatever needed. If I have recording or I record something for ZAAD Academy or to prepare some questions for my programs or if I have lectures that I'd like to prepare. If not, I just, you know, play around. Okay, last three from the game. When I think of meeting Allah, I feel? Happy, alhamdulillah. I don't know if this is, I don't know if this is, I don't know if this is, I don't know if this is, something I should be worried about. You know, when you hear the stories of the Salaf being terrified of dying and meeting their sins. And I don't know, maybe this is Shaytan. Maybe this is overconfidence, but I do feel happy. I do feel satisfied. I do believe in Allah's beautiful names, the most forgiving, the most merciful, the one who guides people to repent and accept their repentance. So he's a tawwab, al-raheem, al-ghaffar, al-latif. When you explain these names to people and you have strong conviction in them, you deal with Allah differently. Yes, I do acknowledge I have sins like big time and I'm in real deep trouble if Allah does not forgive them. But I still have hope that maybe, but I still have hope that maybe, but I still have hope that maybe, but I still have hope that maybe, but I still have hope that maybe, somewhere in this world, one person would have benefited from something I said and raises his hands in the last third of the night and says, oh Allah, forgive Shaykh Asim's sins. And Allah accepts. Just interrupting the podcast for a second to let you guys know about the game that you just watched myself and Shaykh Asim play. It's called the game by Freshly Grounded. And it's a pack of words. of 100 conversation cards for you to open up and to interact with friends, with family, with loved ones, with your spouse, with your children, with your parents. It's got 100 questions. There's so many questions in here. You'll never get, I guarantee you, you'll start having such deep conversations. There'll be tears, there'll be laughter, that you won't get through more than five cards at a session. So it's literally, you can play this unlimited amount of times and every time you play it, you get different answers. It's something that we're really proud of at Freshly Grounded. We've been selling the game now for maybe four years. That's a guess, but it's been played by over 10,000 people and I think you will love it. So to grab the game, head over to shop.freshlygrounded.com. That's shop.freshlygrounded.com. And let's get back to the episode. Okay, so that's enough for the game. Let's go onto a topic that I know you've been asked a lot about this, so forgive me for asking repetitive questions. I know you were recently on another podcast about the game. I know you were recently on another podcast as well, but I think like in the last kind of couple years, there's been a huge kind of growth in terms of the awareness of yourself from people because of the questions kind of being, a lot of the questions going viral and stuff like that. And a lot of it is focused on also, first of all, like a huge part of it is the benefit that you're given. Personally, I want to say, jazakh ulocheh. I only have one WhatsApp group with the brothers that I'm in. There's four of us and we're always kind of sharing the benefit and having a laugh and stuff like that. And often your videos and images are shared in there. So jazakh ulocheh for the immense benefit that you continue to provide. And I don't want to belittle that actually. It's important that we don't because often when people talk about the answers that you give and stuff like that, I think there's this kind of underlying, underlaying of almost ignoring the benefit. However, I think a good reason, a lot of it has gone viral. And so people have been able to benefit more, but a lot of it has gone viral because people enjoy the types of responses that you give. To what extent do you think about the answer and how it's going to be, if it's, does that take a toll on you? Do you think about the criticism? Do you think, oh, people are going to think that I'm too harsh or too funny, or do you just put the answer out how you want to put the answer out? Again, I don't sit and reflect on what I'm going to say in the sense that I'm not a rapper and I'm not a standup comedian who sits and has a notepad and writing down what his strategy is going to be, what is his pitch and try to put scenarios so that whenever a thing like that happens, he has a response, no, come on, this is too much. It just comes spontaneously. And I do have to admit so many times I write the answer on Twitter because Twitter is on the spot. And Twitter you control. Yes. And Twitter is on the spot. It's not something that you read and you prepare. So you just write an answer. So many times I delete. So, oops, no, I'm not ready for people misunderstanding it or saying, oh, this is, but the vast majority of my answers, whether on TV, whether on lectures, whether on Twitter or on my website, I just do it and like Nike, just do it. So I don't think of the consequences because with the grace of Allah, most of my responses are quite sensible measured. So I have like boundaries that I may not cross because it shouldn't be crossed. Right. By Allah Azza wa Jalla, Alhamdulillah, Allah has favored me to do this. So yeah, I just say it. You like it, good for you. You don't like it, tough bananas. Who cares? Are you aware though, that you have a good sense of humor? Of course. You know that? Yes. I've been always, I mean, been praised for this, especially with my daughters. They just sit and laugh their heads off. And I sit with their mom and I make fun of her like crazy. And they, you know, the, I sit with my mom, you know, and I make fun of her like crazy. I cry tears because of the fun I make. Of course I do 50% making fun, 50% praising and love words that makes, you know, metal melt. But then they say, come on, you're giving a bipolar. What is this? We're almost in a borderline personality. You're mixing our emotions up. That's what I do. So yeah, Alhamdulillah, I'm good. But again, this is how I roll with my congregation But again, this is how I roll with my congregation in the masjid, in the streets, with my relatives, with my friends, I'm not going to pretend that Yes, I am a sheikh. No, this is haram. No, you should be serious. No, you. This is not what I do. You guys don't like this? You know, I'm one of the serious students of knowledge. Sue me. I don't care. I didn't ask people to put me, a friend, a friend, a friend, I didn't ask people to put me up front. I didn't ask people to put me up front. upfront or to ask me questions. You don't like what I say, unfollow. So many people you could follow. No, no, no, it's not befitting of a sheikh. Who told you I'm a sheikh? I'm your normal J.I. Joe. So live with it. You mentioned that you do consultations. Within the consultations, what are some of the common themes that come up? I have some in mind that I would think come up, but I'm intrigued to know if that's true or not. And if there's some kind of anomalies in that, that you've even been surprised that come up. So the things that come to mind for me are things like marriage related issues. 30%. Okay, I'd imagine pornography. Five, five to 10%. Okay, I would imagine, Uriba and Waleed. Five to 10%. Okay, so that leaves 60%. OCD. Rehab. Really? Oh, Ushwas is killing the people. Really? Shaytan, and this is why, yeah, I have huge beef with Shaytan. Because people go to psychiatrists and they spend thousands of dollars, session after session and, hmm, tell me about your childhood. And they listen. Okay, our thumbs is up. We did like 10 more sessions. We did like 10 more sessions to get this ongoing with the pipe in his mouth. And you've got to pay his amount ahead of time. Very discreet, Shaykh. Yeah. So the guys keep on going and going. Then he's like, tell me about your abuse when you were young and child. And you talk, talk and there's no benefit. Okay, take Brozac, take this. With the grace of Allah, they come to me. And I said, and I interrupt them. I don't let them vent. Shaykh, I have this, I don't have this. I know. I'd like to continue. He said, no, you come to me to find a solution, not to vent. I know your problem. Why are you repeating it? Listen to me for nine minutes and then you can have the floor. And I pride myself for the grace of Allah that 30 minutes is enough. If you come to me, I feel insulted. And with the grace of Allah, 90 to 95% don't come back. And I get emails saying, totally fixed. I'm not going to come back. I'm going to come back. I'm going to come back. I'm going to come back. I'm going to come back. I'm going to come back. I'm going to come back. I'm going to come back. I have no problems. Some people come to me after six, seven months saying, Shaykh, totally different. You know, the waswas I had with purity, it's all gone. I have another waswas with divorce, with kufr, and I know exactly how Shaytan works. So I have never studied psychology in my life. I don't have knowledge in it, but I know how Shaytan works. So I can speak to people with the experience that Allah have graced me with. And I can tell from the first, and I Casa I Qubi Al-Mansos streethuwa from Qaddam. I offer him's on Prophet Mohammed. I just them say the word al-M discussing with him, that Allah has certain culture. I think of it as a pleasure to talk about this. Getting out ofまり of a sh боль was a nightmare. I was a kid and up to. of those who come to me thinking that the marriage is invalid. So I was engaged in this kind of relationship before marriage. No sex, nothing. I knew someone. I was with a guy and we were chatting on the phone and he said, marry yourself to me. And I said, I give you myself in marriage. And we laughed about it and he accepted. So are we married? Because I married 10 years ago later and I have six kids. And now I'm getting these thoughts that my marriage is invalid and my children are born out of wedlock. She's crying. She's weeping. Someone coming to me saying, I said to my wife, Lulu. And I thought that maybe Lulu in Zimbabwe means I divorce you. So now I can't think of myself and they're crying to me. So with the grace of Allah. Okay. So I know people who also had many questions about OCD and stuff. And earlier I mentioned, Sheikh Mohammed Tim and he deals with a lot of, he kind of like focuses on Rukia and stuff like that. You said 30 minutes and they don't come back. So I'm intrigued. You've dangled the carrot. If somebody comes to you and says they have an issue with purity, they can all have a middle of the correct way and so on and so forth. From a general point of view, because obviously you're dealing with people directly. And so you get a bit more context. What are the kinds of things that you're talking about and explaining to help? Is it like Rukia and it's in practical steps? Not Rukia at all. Okay. So what are the, it says more practical. It's see, I'm an eye opener. So, so I just asked the person, he says, I spent half an hour doing wudu. Okay. So the okay, Mashallah. You're good. You're very clean. How much water do you use? He said, oh, gallons. Good. Very good. How much water did the Prophet use? He said one mut, approximately 0.7 liter, a small bottle of water. He said, good. Are you more righteous and knowledgeable than Him? He said, no. So what are you doing? Because I said, no, no, no, no. Don't justify. Tell me, do you know more than him? He said, no. Then, I said I am wrong. What are you going to do? So this is how we take it step by step him confessing, convinced that he's doing wrong and that he's obeying Shaytan. End of story. It's interesting because it's, it's, it's not even a study of anyone. It's a trial, which is the problem. It's interesting because it's not just the worship, it's the worship, it's the, it's the healing. Yeah. You say you haven't studied psychology and stuff, but actually the method that you're using there is very similar to what somebody who has studied it would use, which is to kind of like ask the questions for the person to come to their own conclusion. As I said, I have no idea what they do, but I know that with experience, with trial and errors, and with the grace of Allah, of course, above all, people do see where they're going wrong. And the moment you manage to tell a patient about their illness, this is half of the cure. The other half is in your hands. And most of counseling sessions, by the way, finish by 15, 17 minutes. The guy says, done. He said, okay, you have 13 minutes to go. He said, nothing to add. He said, are we good? He said, yeah, perfect. So this time is free. You're not going to get a refund. He said, I don't want any. Alhamdulillah, astonishingly, a lot of the brothers come after a while and say, sheikh, I'm sponsoring 10 sessions for the sake of Allah. I benefited a lot. Subhanallah. Here's the money. Okay, this is good for the down payment of my boat. Keep up the good work. Okay, so you said a big part of it is OCD as well. Correct. What other things are kind of common that come up? So we've got marriage, OCD, how's that kind of the big ones? Yeah, marriage, divorce issues. Did the divorce take place or not? Especially from the subcontinent, the free divorce issue. Hanafi said. It's done. So people come to me. Sheikh, my husband was enraged and said, talak, talak, talak. Immediately, any Hanafi scholar said, you're done. You need halala. You have to get married again to another man and then live with him and then get divorced in order to go back to your first husband. And this is not the real fatwa that is applicable. You can't just destroy people's marriages just like that. So they come. To me, people have problems with her metal Messiah, which is also another thing. Famously widely spread in the subcontinent and not found anywhere else. If a man is thinking sexually about his daughter in law or touches her inappropriately, the marriage is dissolved. Who said this? What is this? This is ridiculous even. So they come to me with. Say. Similar questions. Problems with the kids, especially those living in North America or in Europe. My son is coming out of the closet and he says he's homosexual. My daughter is declaring she's lesbian and she's living with her girlfriend. What should we do? How to act? Apostasy and the likes. So they come asking for how to resolve problems with the father who beats them up, who doesn't provide for them. What should be the relationship be like and the likes. So I try to give them advice from an Islam perspective from the pros and cons. The consequences. Should I file for divorce from my husband? He mistreats me. Beats me. Does this. It is that says, okay, what are your choices on the table? You're going to be kicked out. Do you divorce him? Then what work as a prostitute? Nobody is to provide for you. Your family doesn't want you think of the consequences. So. Yeah. The likes. Okay. It's a deep, deep topics. What's your take on stress? Because I am already thinking that you kind of yourself had have worked your own personality to improve at managing stress. True. So kind of, I guess, like, what's that journey like and how can one improve managing stress? Because I heard this quote about stress, which I think is. So true. And he said that stress, it first makes a person ugly and then it kills them. When you're stressed, whether it's because jealousy, because of someone bullying you, because of the fear of the future and what it may hold because a job you lost because of debts, you have to pay off because of rent, because of a nagging wife, because of a debt. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Disobedient child. Yeah. If you have trust in Allah. Yeah. If you know, what is the meaning of the name Alwakil, when we say hasbun Allah wani'mal wakil. What does Alwakil mean? When you trust Allah, depend on him and totally rely on him. You live a stressless life because everything is in hands. So why are you worried? when Ibrahim peace be upon him was destined to be executed by being thrown in the inferno in this huge fire that they built for him. He just said, Allah will suffice us and he is the one we trust and rely upon. Boom, end of story. You're going to be fried and cooked and grilled no problem. Allah is my protector. So when you have this concept there's no stress in life. Life goes up and down and whenever the night is the darkest dawn is close by. So trust Allah. You have no stress at all. Sometimes it feels more difficult to implement than a it feels a bit more difficult to implement. But what you're saying I think is still obviously you have no choice. Again, you lost your son. May Allah protect all of your children. You lost your son. What are you going to do? Bang your head against the wall? You're going to break the wall but your son is still going to be dead. So why the stress? It's gone. Allah Azza wa Jal preordained it. Be content and move on and you will find that you are not dead. You will find that Allah will fill your heart with peace and tranquility. JazakAllah khair Sheikh. We got a couple minutes left so I'm going to shoot you a few words and I want you to respond with a word. Well, it could be a few words if you can't find an A word but the point is it's very, very short. I'm going to give you 10 words inshallah, okay? We'll couple words. Social media. Double-edged blade. Marriage. Blessing. Music. Beautiful but haram. Debt. Burden during the night and humility during the day. Overthinking. OCD. Raising children. A challenge that you need Allah's help and without it you're lost. Coffee. Tea. It first makes you feel good. Peace. Tea. No. It's just a word. It's just a word. I don't have any preference over. Do you drink coffee? I drink coffee but only to help my heart, not that I love it. Okay. Only when I travel out of the kingdom is that I go for cappuccino. I used to because I'm a Salafi. Now, alhamdulillah, I've become moderate Salafi so I go for latte because the foam is less. It's more milk. Yeah, it's less foam. The foam is a problem. Yeah, foam is a problem with cappuccino. You should do a cortado, Shaykh. I don't know. This is too much. Maybe I need another 10 years. Okay. The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. Allahumma sallahu wa sallam alayhi. The love of my life. Favorite Quran reciter. I love them all. Min Shawee because I don't have a cassette or a CD. Cassette, I know you're too young for cassettes. No, I'm a cassette, Shaykh. Okay, alhamdulillah. I don't have something that I play on. We have, alhamdulillah, Allah graced us with the channel of Quran 24-7. So I just listen to it to the radio. Min Shawee would be the best. But if I were to listen to something that I would be moved by, I go with Shaykh Tawfiq Al-Sayr. It's interesting because you seem to have this common thread in this conversation where you, I don't know whether you'd call yourself a Zia or not, but you seem to be a minimalist. And it's interesting now in this day and age where people are, the norm is for us to gather things and buy things and it's very materialistic. How can a person remain minimal? And this is your final question, Shaykh. I'm happy with whatever Allah gives me. So why? So people ask me, would you like to buy a new car? I said, no, I have a car that takes me from point A to B. Maybe if 30 years ago, I would have given you a list. Of the cars that I really want to buy and own. Nowadays, I'm content. I remember 10 years ago, I was in Dubai. And Dr. Zakir Naik called me and said, Shaykh Hassan, what about going to do some test drive? I have a friend who has a dealership of exotic cars. And he set up like 30 cars, you know, Bugattis, Chirons, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches. And we just go and test drive it in the circuit. He said, I'm not interested. I said, Shaykh, why? I know you love cars. He said, yeah, I know all about these cars, but I can't afford it. So I'm not interested. So I'm content with what I have, with the grace of Allah. Shaykh, JazakAllah khair for your time. Honestly, I really appreciate it and honor to have you on our podcast. May Allah bless you. Thank you for your time. JazakAllah khair for flying all the way to Saudi to honor you. JazakAllah khair for flying all the way to Saudi to honor you. JazakAllah khair for flying all the way to Saudi to honor you. JazakAllah khair for flying all the way to Saudi to honor me with this. Though I think you've wasted a lot of your time and the viewers time. You should have done this with someone who is worthwhile. But JazakAllah khair for the invitation. And may Allah Azza wa Jal make my deeds and yours sincere for his sake. Ameen. Warak rafiq. As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh."
