  "title": "Hate the sin or innovation, not the sinner or innovator? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "a sister says is it from the sunnah to be merciful towards the sinner and innovator but dislike the sin and innovation again what do you mean by merciful do you mean that if i see an innovator or a sinner i smile in their face and i hug them and i take them as my best buddies and friends honor them and be proud in front of people that the this guy is my friend i know him this is not permissible why because this person is doing a sin minor major is an innovator and i have to detach myself away from him or at least have a sort of communication just to warn him and try to give him doubt but not to praise him but if he fell and broke his leg whether he's an innovator or a sinner should i say haha that's good man i'm happy for you may allah break your other leg of course not this is not the characteristic of a proper muslim i should be compassionate and pray for him the prophet isaiah visited a jew servant of his when he got sick he's a kafir not an innovator he's even worse he's a catholic and he is not a sinner he's a disbeliever yet the prophet visited him showed him compassion and gave him dawah to islam and the boy accepted islam so you have to differentiate what do you mean by being merciful towards the sinners and allah knows best you"
