  "title": "OCD Determining END of Menses, do not hasten to take Ghusl assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sumeyya from the UK and even if it has some yellowness, I will see something that if I had seen it on my period days, I would not have said this is impure, I would have said oh the brown spot is from the private area or the yellowness is normal because it's not really, like there's some dirt in it and since there's some dirt then it's pure by default, that's what I do in my period days. No, this is not true. If your menses is over in six or seven days and you have spottings or colored discharges, this means that this is part of your period. You should wait. Once it becomes clear or you see the white thread discharge, if you see the white thread-like discharge coming pure without any colored discharges or spottings, immediately take your ghusl. If you don't, but you have moments of dryness where you don't see any colored discharges when you wipe, you are instructed to insert a tampoon and if the tampoon comes clear without any colored spottings or discharges on it, then you make your ghusl and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best. Always you can ask the elder women in your family, an elder sister, your mom, because this is what the women used to do with mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her, when they used to show her their pads and she would say don't hasten in ghusl until you see the white thread-like discharge. So there is no problem in consulting other women of experience that would help you in this and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
