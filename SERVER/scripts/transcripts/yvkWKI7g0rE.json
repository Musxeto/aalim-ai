  "title": "Pray in Hanafi Masjid or Salafi Masjid that has 2 Khateebs, Khutbah in Arabic & other in local",
  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I have a question. Why is it better to pray in a Salafi Masjid where they do a bid'ah of having two khateebs? Like, first the imam does a futba in Arabic and then someone else stands up and does it in the local language. Or to go to a Hanafi Masjid where the imam believes that Mawlid is good and openly promotes it, but they only do it in one language and thus not doing the same bid'ah as the other Masjid. The first Masjid is a Salafi Masjid and he has two khateebs for both Jum'ah khutbah? Yeah. That is very awkward. And I don't think that this is even permissible. The khutbah has to be delivered by one imam. The prayer can be delivered by someone, can be led by someone else. But to split the khutbah into two, this is not permissible. So I would recommend that you go to the Hanafi Masjid and never to call this Masjid, the first one, as a Salafi Masjid."
