  "title": "Will my dua be REJECTED if I don't give salutations upon the Prophet ﷺ",
  "transcript": "I have a fan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. So my question is that Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said that every Dua is blocked unless you recite Darood before an end of your Dua. So if I did not do it, will my Dua be rejected? No, your Dua is not rejected but the fear of it not being answered is there. Any Dua that you say has etiquettes. So the etiquette is to praise Allah Azza Wa Jal. And then to offer salutation upon the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam who said any Dua that you don't offer salutation upon me is blocked. And afterwards you ask Allah Azza Wa Jal for what you need without transgression and without any sin in it. Now if I don't do this, if I do not follow such etiquettes. If I don't say my Dua at preferred times like between Adhan and Iqama and the last third night of the night. And when the rain is falling down and the rooster is calling before Fajr etc. If I don't select these times and I just make Dua, will it not be accepted? The answer is yes. But it's most likely to be accepted if you do them at these specific times. And likewise it is mostly to be accepted when you offer salutation upon the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. But if you just say O Allah save me. O Allah cure my illness without doing these steps of etiquette, then it is heard. And Allah says in Surat Al Baqara وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبُ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا الدَّعَانِ Whenever my servants ask you about me, tell them that I'm close. I respond to whomever calls me. Then this is sufficient for us and Allah knows best."
