  "transcript": "so we have a question from Z at and Z at says I read that lead is rajab for anyone who is not a mush to head is this true these are Islamic terminologies tallit is blindly following someone without evidence Rajab is compulsory mush to hate is the highest rank of a scholar who has the ability to look through the evidences of the Quran the Sunnah and the previous scholars with his knowledge and detect what is the most suitable and correct opinion of all so now Said's question is I heard that blindly following a person without evidence is watch it is mandatory is that true this depends on the individual people are categorized into three levels a scholar who is a master head who does not imitate or blindly follow others rather he has to it's an obligation that he looks into the evidences of the Quran of the Sunnah of the in through the understanding of the favorite three generations looks into the different opinions and then comes up comes up with his own opinion that is 99.99 percent following those who came before him but he's doing that through his own observation not through cherry-picking the second and these people the most a hates the ulema they're a handful really the few of them the second level is those who are classified as students of knowledge and students of knowledge are people with appropriate amount of knowledge but they're not classified as scholars yet so they have the basics of the English the Arabic language knowledge of the Koran of the Deaf seer of the hadith authentic or not authentic of of a soulful and the others so they come and they look and search a topic they cannot come up with their own HT hat rather they have to look into the six seven different HT hands of previous scholars and come up with a conclusion that one of them is the most authentic and they adopt this so tack lead for such people is not permissible because they have the means to search and they have the tools that would qualify them to search the third segment of people and this is the largest of them all are the laymen who can be professors in the university medical doctors neurosurgeons engineers pilots intellectuals but their knowledge in Islamic sharia is negligible such people must follow someone or a method because Allah says in the Quran tha's a new radically in kuntum Litella moon you must ask the people of knowledge if you do not know so they ask and whatever the sheikh tells them they comply without knowing the evidence because even if the share tells them the evidence they wouldn't know whether this is Quran Sunnah or just a quotation from Tom Dick or Harry they wouldn't know so in this case yes such people must follow but they must not be blind followers for a school of thought in whatever they say good or bad because on the day of judgment Allah would ask you about two things matha kuntum turbo duel what were you worshipping meaning sincerity Allah Azza WA JAL to heat of lordship worship and the smell so fat the second question mega a jabber to mull more saline what did you answer the messengers that were sent to you so this means that you have to answer and follow the messengers and a large version knows best"
