  "title": "Should we avoid being seen in public with men who wear their pants below their ankles, as we do with",
  "transcript": "Ibrahim from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? I hope you are doing good. I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. How can I help you? Sheikh, recently I watched a video of yours where you were explaining to a woman about her friends who weren't wearing hijab. And you told her basically that you shouldn't hang out with them in public and stuff like that. And I just wanted to know, is this same ruling applied to men who do isbal? You know, like they leave the stuff under the ankles. Is it something that we shouldn't go in public with them and stuff like that? No, the answer is not. This is a sin that is related to the individual himself and not transgressing to others. If a man shaves his beard, if a man wears his trousers below his ankles, this is upon him. Nobody is harmed by it. But when a woman does not abide by the hijab, men are affected by that sin because they're seeing something that is haram. So she is the initiator of such a sin. Her being a hijabi and a woman of chaste cannot be associated with such individuals in public because this tarnishes her reputation as a hijabi and it acts as an endorsement of their transgression and sin, and Allah knows best."
