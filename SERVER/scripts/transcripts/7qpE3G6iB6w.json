  "transcript": "[Music] once again this new lecture is the same as the old one so did you understand the old one alhamdulillah this this was a joke of one of the imams who came and he said to them do you know the story of no and the flood he said yes said alhamdulillah the following J he came and he said do you know the story of no and the flood they said no said then you don't have to know it the third J he came do you know the story of and the flood they said some yes some said no so okay those who know tell those who don't know so again the topic is about the relationship between the family members now if you read the Quran which is something that we rarely do most of us read the Quran for Baraka but we rarely Ponder and contemplate and this is the reason that Allah revealed the Quran to be pondered upon to contemplate upon When you pray and you say ald you Ponder in Salat that Allah is responding to you by saying Allah is replying to you you not to me or to us to you individually my servant has praised me my servant has complimented me my servant has glorified me how would your Salah be but look at our Sal today there is no soul to it so if you read the Quran one Ayah oh mankind indeed we have created you from male and female and made you people and tribes that you may know one another indeed the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous so man and a woman male and female this is the origin of humanity also Allah says about MSA peace be upon him and appoint for me a minister or an assistant from my family Haron my brother Subhan Allah who's the best person on Earth to share with you goodness your own flesh and blood your brother and this is what M did he wanted his brother to be associated with him and share prophethood and share the reward from Allah asael and Allah also says and Allah has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things so the Quran speaks about about the family and what the family constitutes of spouses man and a wife children grandchildren so the only system on Earth that governs everything is Islam and this is a challenge go and read in Judaism and Christianity and Buddhism in Hinduism in Sikhism in any ISM read in any religion and find me something that has a perfect system like Islam you will not find that no way it's impossible it's a challenge yet still ah but I was born on this religion I can't switch okay stay it's up to you enjoy your life 60 years or 70 years on Earth but then you'll be in Hell For Eternity sorry to say this but it's your choice I have no problem with that your life enjoy it but Islam gives you evidences proofs without any dispute or doubt so when we come to this family how is the relationship within the family how is it governed well between the man and wife this is a whole different topic that we' spoke about so many times the responsibilities the rights being kind being dutiful Etc we will not go into that but what about the siblings first of all the default in families specifically and in our relationship generally is to resp respect the elders the prophet saidat he who does not respect the elders and is not merciful upon the youngsters he's not from us Subhan Allah this is a serious threat how do you respect the elders in your family it at your workplace how do you have mercy on the children do we have mercy on the children having mercy of the on the children is to be compassionate to be kind to be loving and caring and to educate them this is part of being merciful upon children and our role model is Muhammad sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam our prophet and messenger his grandchild um his granddaughter Umama this is the name of a female Umama not Obama it's Umama I have alhamdulillah you know yeah I have 13 girls no boys yeah I I I Implement what I say h so I have a lot of children and I have 14 grandchildren alham that's why I'm sitting down maybe if I had less I would have stood up and gave you a lecture but I'm too old I'm maybe next year I'll be carrying a cane you never know anyhow I name my girls in Islamic names and in Saudi Arabia when they hear the name said what what is this so one of my daughters is JIA I went to the hospital once and I said to the clerk J I said ju Juju no no no it's not jiujitsu said why the guy's asking me why you give her the such a name and Haram I said this is the mother of the believer this is the wife of the Prophet maybe half of you say is she Jia is the name of the wife of the Prophet the mother of the Believers another one is also this is these are the first times we hear these names we know aaad that's it yeah the prophet had nine wives Alam he died leaving behind nine wives so these names are beautiful one of his grandchildren is nam Umama the daughter of his grandchild who is her father I just said okay who is his wife no huh y he had four daughters y huh Zab this is cheating is from behind the curtains no this is not fair they the first class we're talking about the economy coach Zab to Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasallam she was married to Abul who was her cousin so was his aunt so these stories you should know like the back of your hand this is your heritage this is your lineage this is your family but people don't know so the prophet going back to the before they tell me I have five minutes going back to I'm good in wasting time but we're here not to waste time we're here to learn how to preserve and to maintain our our families so he used to pray carrying his daughter Umama and whenever he bowed down or prostrated he placed her on the ground an infant and when he stood up he picked her up and this is a reply to some of the schools of thought that say three movements in the Salat breaks it no it doesn't the prophet moved like 20 there is no nothing as three movements in the Salah breaks it as long as there is a need to move in the Salat go ahead then move what is the use of praying four when in the first ra you get an itch in your shoulder and you're fighting it four ra you waste it doing this you don't know what the IM recited what did the IM recite well I don't know Sheik of course you don't know it was see even you did not know so the the problem is the problem is that no sometimes you have to move you have to do this you have to have some movement the prophet used to carry um and pray with herat alassan and Hussein his grandchildren used to mount him in Sal in when he was in suud they come and they ride on his back what is this if this happens with me as an IM leading the prayer in M what will the congregation do they will kick me out of the Salah you're not a good IM why how do you let let your children ride you in the Salat and waste our time no no no you're not good fire him the prophet Alam did this he's our role model to teach us how to to deal with what with youngsters nowaday all what you see is too much discipline sit don't speak fetch he's not a dog he's a child you have to have mercy on children we try to treat them and deal with them as as if they're adults no they are children it's part of their job description to break things to play around to make a mess but we try to have love and compassion and bringing them up in a way that they feel the love not the reprimanding also a woman used to come to the prophet with a total stranger maybe you say these are his grandchildren he was kind to them no even a stranger a woman comes with a child for the prophet to doik you know what tnik is so the prophet carries a child puts a date in his uh uh um ceiling and the child urinates on the prophet Alam making a mess no diapers no we're boycotting so we use towels huh we're not using Pampers or or these things so he makes a mess the woman is terrified y Allah what did you do he's an elephant why he doesn't even understand what language you're talking so the prophet said don't don't worry don't worry don't worry he brings some water sprink it on the urine Kal over don't wash it no this is minor impurity the most minor impurity is the urine of a male boy who did not eat solid food the major of impurity is dog saliva the medium is the normal impurities feces urine Etc so we have rare medium and Well Done anyhow so this is not his child but he was also merciful and kind and he used to love his young children alassan Hussein as a man we usually find it difficult to express our emotions the prophet his grandchildren he used to sit them on their lap his lap and he kisses them one of the bedwin saw him once he said you do this I have 10 children and I've never kissed them once in my life and the prophet said Alat wasam who never has Mercy will never be forgiven and have mercy from Allah you show Mercy to your children Allah will show you Mercy in this life and in the here after and whenever he sat and ate with children he used to teach them this is part of being merciful one of the companion children used to eat and you know like children they eat from everywhere they go and catch the nice pieces of food from in front of everyone the prophet said to him oh boy say bismah eat with your right hand and eat from what is in front of you beautiful teaching this is part of being merciful this is Islam and this is the relationship in our family how are you with the children in your family wah I've seen families that were a joy to my heart I've seen teenagers taking care of their kids 3 four years uh not their kids their their brothers taking care of them taking them to the toilet helping the mom taking them out playing with them very beautiful site and I've seen families that they were so rude so abusive to their younger children this is not the Islamic way of doing it the flip side is you have to to also respect and be dutiful and honor the elders and the elders are not necessarily those who have white or gray hair anyone who's older than you is an elder W he till this date people who are older than me even if they were gen janitors or Servants of mine or uh workers or someone that people look down at I respect them and I treat them like Elder Brothers to me not because I like to show off I do like to show off every now and then but because I do this as a form of worship it feels good that he's the janitor or he's the coffee boy that I help him that I carry things with him that I do things to make him feel respected the prophet saidat part of glorifying Allah is honoring the gray haired Muslim if you want to glorify Allah someone who has gray hair because of his age you you also respect him and you honor him and in theah Hadith a man a companion was discovered killed murdered at the gates of you know the village of the Jews so his younger brother he's the one who responsible for his elder brother came with two other companions cousins to complain to the prophet Alat wasam now being the younger brother of the deceased of the victim he wanted to present his case the prophet said meaning let the elders speak you he's a man and he is the brother but because they are older than you respect the hierarchy of age so the man did not speak and they spoke and also in a dream the prophet Alat wasam saw a vision he said I was using the miswak brushing my teeth and then two men came one of them is older than the other so I gave the miswak to the younger one to use it and I was told that no give give it to the Elder one even in the vision what does this teach you look at us when we go into a gathering or to a Masjid or to a um hall or in a train Railway and we find Elders standing and all the punks are sitting where is the respect stand up and give him your seat Muslims do this alhamdulillah we we still have some in Us in outside in the world you don't find this because they don't have this kind of respect so the relationship between the family members is based on respecting the elders and having Mercy on the youngsters regardless they're males or females so I mentioned this in the last lecture a lot of the boys abuse being a male thinking that they have power over their Elder sisters and this is not true you have to respect your elder sister and some of them even sit and try to enforce being the Master of the House go cook me some food do my laundry do this do that and this is not her responsibility she's doing this out of courtesy because your mother is the one who's going to do it but you as a punk don't do what you're supposed to do you're not earning you're not providing for her you're not giving her pocket money so you don't have the right to go and start to say such things so in order to have good relationship in the family there are a number of factors or rules that must be implemented number one mutual respect and we've mentioned this before for so we will highlight it a little bit the mutual respect is required between the man and his wife and this display of mutual respect Cascades and reflects on the children when they say when they see their parents expressing such respect meaning uh my wife bring me water wrong bring me water please this is very important and in so many cases putting little little spices Salt and Pepper would make the food beautiful like saying honey my love darling even if you hate her guts seriously it has a profound impact on the girl on the woman and on her children once this is automatically on your tongue you will be surprised I remember when I was coming here where was I I was I was in Morocco last week I was in Casablanca and the custom officer I don't say that they I I don't say anything I want to go back again so I went there I gave the man my passport and he start flipping it and he said um boarding pass I gave him the boarding pass while giving him the boarding pass I said may Allah forgive you the guy dropped the passport and the the the the boarding pass seriously and he went leaned back on his chair and said wall this is the most beautiful word I've ever heard in the beginning of the day till they he almost broke in in tears and I was duh okay if if it's this much okay I'm fine the guy was so touched by what may Allah forgive you he was touched you know a country like Morocco and people who come and go and his job just to say a good word it melts steel now imagine if you say this word 10 20 50 times to your wife honey darling please I love you this and that W this would break not the ice it would break any problems in communicating and this is a advice I give to you right now if you have a mobile take it and send your wife a message honey I love you or I miss you and if you have a husband do the same wall it has profound impact of course you're going to be questioned at the end of the day what's wrong what did you do but but seriously it has an impact these small things we forget and neglect respect is extremely important especially when there is pressure when there are calamities when there are problems and you self-restraining they see oh Dad is behaving like this H I should be like that dad is always has perseverance he's always calm I would be like that and if it was the opposite way around they will be like that unfortunately number two this is one of the rules that have to be implemented there has to be no bossing around and imposing your own opinion what is the meaning of bossing around so many of our siblings they all like to be rulers like the Americans say all chiefs no Indians or in the army they say all officers no soldiers because they in the do this do that do this do that in my children I have some of them who like to boss others and they think of themselves as CEOs okay you do the dishes you do the sink you do the kitchen floor and you do the laundry okay what are you going to do I'm giving orders so this is what they do there are people are like this no in Healthy Families everybody is invited to contribute I know a family that the father whenever he wants to buy a car he gathers the whole family children and teenagers and adults and his wife and he says I have these options 1 2 3 4 and I'd like to buy so what do you think oh this is an SUV no this is a four-wheel drive no this is fast this is old this is American this is Japanese they all give and contribute they feel that their opinion has importance already he has bought the car but it is good that you share them in this process or procedure because it gives them importance unlike do this do that and you allow them to express without being intimidated some family is the moment the child opens his mouth he's reprimanded no no no shut up shut up you don't know anything yeah but I think no no no you have no knowledge in this stop shut up and this oppressive environment and not having them uh Express their own feelings this is unhealthy because they will grow up not thinking for themselves you think for them how many do you know in your families and surroundings where the children had to go to college to a specific field that they did not want to my father wanted me to become a doctor I hate medicine what do you like I like to be an engineer I love engineering I'm beautiful in drawing I'm an architect but my father insisted to be an a doctor and the opposite my father wants me to be an engineer because he is an engineer and my uncles are engineers and and they force their opinion and and their wish upon their children this is totally wrong and take it from me as a child you have all the right to disobey your father Yes Yes you paid money to come I'm giving you fatwa for free this is your life obeying the parents is not in whatever they say Simon Says stand on one foot for half an hour what are you doing my father told me to stand on one foot no this is not something you have to obey you obey your father in what is logical what is normal in what benefits him and there is no danger on you you know how many counseling sessions I had with men coming to me after five Mar years of marriage wanting to divorce why did you why do you want to divorce my parents forced me to marry my cousin after two children now and 5 years I don't want her anymore I can't sit look in her face whose mistake is it no it's not the parents it's your mistake if you were a real man you would have stood your ground you said nope but you're a Mommy's boy you're still sucking your thumb and now you're destroying a marriage of a woman of a family of because you did not become a real man so you have to give your children a freedom to choose no you have to eat your broccoli I don't like to eat broccoli you have to eat this you have to do this you have to wear this you have to sit like this you have to go with us there give them a room I wish you did not bring your children now the children are say h see that anyhow this is your problem not mine so give your child a chance to choose and to have their own opinion number three rule number three Family First and we've talked about this in this family all members act as the family is first we will not ever do anything that would harm our family or tarnish its reputation or any member of them just because of my own interest in this family a girl does not go and tarnish her parents reputation by involving in Haram relationship yes it is Haram yes Allah is angry but also they don't want to hurt their father's feelings and maybe cause a heart attack they value the family in this family family first each and every member realize that we are one and I can depend on every member so I'm not alone I can depend on my brother I can 100% depend on my sister on my parents I feel that they are with me when my sister cries I cry because she's my sister she's my flesh and blood so we're always together they are my back they have my back they are my rock and we always have solidarity Among Us especially at times of Crisis we have a saying in Arabic me and my brother are against our cousin but me and my cousin are against the stranger so my cousin he's my blood together we solidarity we fight enemies but when it comes to my brother no me and my brother are against my cousin because he's closer to me he's me number four a rule in good family relationship is quality time and this we find in families that have a lot of children a family that has one or two child children they don't have that much of quality time but when you have five or six siblings you play together you form a football team together you go on picnics together you can play UNO more interesting rather than when you with your own brother playing alone reverse reverse reverse reverse this is boring you need family members and I know this because as I said I have a big family alhamdulillah I can see my children and when they grew up we did not have a TV set imagine the first 20 years of my life no television set what did they grow up bored oh we're bored we want no they had their own games and they played day and night together and they invented games they had board games they had intellectual games games no TV nowadays the grandchildren and the youngsters they don't have this quality time they have social media they have iPads they have Smart uh it's not smart but they call it smartphone it's for those who because they sit on it like five six hours they don't communicate they just keep on watching watching it's it's like a sponge they absorb everything that is evil and bad they can't play back they can't say something they cannot contribute they just have to absorb everything and unfortunately with the media with the television with the video games I know people that stay 10 to 12 hours of my relatives not my children alhamdulillah 12 hours a day on video games and he's a half of the Quran he memorizes is the Quran like crazy but he's hooked and addicted to video games and putting the headphones and shouting and jumping on the chair what's wrong with him so no no he's playing no no you should shoot shoot and you it's very strange I cannot play video games at all alhamdulillah since young age till date I cannot play video games and I hate video games once I tried to play a game in like 30 years ago it's called Doom huh after 5 minutes I vomited five or 10 minutes I play so tense I went to I vomited everything in my stomach my brother played it he started bleeding from his nose what is this we started reading ayat maybe it's possessed or something so I I hate video games but people have different orientations some people like this some people don't like that so quality time is very very essential in the family number five appreciation and gratitude and I mentioned this before beautiful words in the family always they express their appreciation and gratitude differently all what you need is a gesture a simple word that you do to express how you feel to your siblings and this has a huge impact you may not recognize but it will come back to you two three years a sister says to her you remember two years ago I was very tired it was my turn to do the dishes and you simply said no no sis you're tired I'll do it till date I remember it two years she remembers because kindness acts of kindness are never forget forgotten so a simple gesture of thank you or wow the food was extremely delicious today for a first trial of your sister or your mom or your brother doing something oh mashallah you brought all this groceries wow man you have you've done a lot you're so strong you're so uh uh masallah hardworking these little words have the impact and effect of Magic the sixth rule is the feeling of security in the house in the family we do not intimidate one another we do not frighten one another of the consequences if you do this this will happen this you're going to do this you're going to fail you're going to no we give them a feeling of security a feeling of uh uh um a chance to make mistakes so even those who fall into mistake it's not the end of the world why because we are all sinful we all make mistakes yes this was wrong and maybe it has consequences that you have to pay you broke your brother's toy we're going to take one of yours and give it to him but it's not the end of the world that you have to remind him six years later you remember when you broke his story no this is wrong a sin that took place a mistake that took place it's gone don't bring it up and make it a something to taunt them with and also the punishment has to be equivalent to the sin or to the mistake sometimes we go overboard and for a simple mist mistake or error or sin we give too much of a punishment I divorced my wife why because she did this and that no this is unfair you should have taken certain steps and stages before jumping the gun uh uh this fashion how much time 10 10 minutes so I'll conclude with in these 10 minutes with with some insight to know whether your family is a close tightly knit family or broken family how is it possible to determine this by a number of factors if you find these factors in your family you should be grateful to Allah that my family is closely knit tightly knit and not broken and don't don't be deceived deceived by what you see number one a tightly close uh um family is a family that enjoys emotional and physical security inside the family the ma family members don't go outside unlike broken families you will find family members compl in to others outside in this family there is security inside the siblings talk to one another they come to their parents father I did this mother I did that I don't know what to do give me a choice they consult them it's all within the family this means that they don't have to pretend because in a tight close family they do not pretend to one another they deal with trans transparency but if they're broken everybody's pretending I never knew that my brother is like this I never thought that my sister would do something like that everybody's pretending but in a very close tight family they act normally they're not afraid because they feel this transparency is healthy and beneficial and there is no depression there is no anxiety they are together number two positive support from the family and this we've mentioned before positive support is not only limited to honey darling love or the food was good um I like your homework uh uh writing I it's not limited to that it is also available such positive support at times of calamities so many women come to me and they complain sheh my husband is insensitive when my father was undergoing cancer surgery which was very critical he was ask inviting in the same time of the surgery he was inviting his relatives to dine in our homes and he was asking me to cook food now how insensitive is this if you go to the man and said I didn't think it was that important she because he was doing it in some other country yes but you know she's worried she's busy she's on the phone yeah some sensitivity likewise the wife is seeing that her husband has been fired today from his work and she says okay where are we dining today where are you taking me you should show him compassion that you are yeah sad and and you are sharing with him his uh Calamity this kind of positive support is extremely uh um required thirdly in a tight close family there has to be ground rules any family without rules is broken what do you mean by rules rules of engagement when to fight and how to to fight is it okay to hit below the belt the belt no no this is very bad no rules is meant that in the house There Are Rules times of prayer there is no playing everybody has to pray on time we don't have to always say did you pray did you make W did you no There Are Rules we reme remind you once twice but then this has to become become a system there has to be a system in regards of when is the curfew from not going out so at 9:00 you have to be home you don't come back at 9:00 p.m. or 10: p.m. or 11: p.m. there has to be a deadline for social media and gadgets so after 7:00 there is no mobiles in Ramadan you have only between and to check your social media and then switch off the phone and put it in the cupboard it's time for no electronic gadgets after 10:00 p.m. even if you have a test I have an homework you should have done it in the afternoon why delay it until 11:00 p.m. these are ground rules that have to be implemented so food lunch time is served as at 1:30 2:00 dinner is served served at 7:00 everybody has to be on the table where is so and so oh they're asleep oh they could not make it they're doing uh uh some homework that no these are rules that have to be implemented and followed by everybody so that we are close by we have this uh uh system fifthly there has to be a healthy valid Communication System between the family members and we spoke about this before you have to know how to communicate how to talk the moment you see that the siblings are shouting at one another they're not communicating they're exchanging swear words they're or insults they're not communicating likewise with the spouses likewise with the father and his children sometimes the father curses his own child may Allah curse your father this is in Arabic by the way this is so commonly used and he's the father this goes directly to you yes I'm frustrated but okay curse his mother not you this is weird so they'll pick it up from you this is not communication there has to be healthy uh appropriate form of communication which requires each one listening to the other give them time to speak to express and then you can reciprocate and finally there has to be love compassion and sacrifice among the family members the prophet said when Allah loves a household he introduces kindness so you'll find find them loving one another caring for one another sharing with one another sometimes I see one of my daughters going out calling her other sister saying listen I'm at this shop and I saw this and this dress for you look I'm send you pictures would you like me to buy it for you would you like me to do this and that this kind of attitude shows that this expression of love and sharing and sacrifice no no no no you can go and visit your friend I'll do the dishes today I'll do your shortes today no this is Once in a week in a month time wedding you go and attend and I'll take care of your children I'll babysit your children this is the sacrifice we're looking for it's not only me that the whole universe revolves around I am a member of the family and one for all alhamdulillah okay for the session number five so inshallah now we begin on our Q&A [Music] sessions"
