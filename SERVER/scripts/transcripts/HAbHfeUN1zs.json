  "transcript": "habib from bangladesh there is a hadith that there is no competition except archery and it goes on now horse racing so my question is i have seen in one of your videos and also in when you fatwa that you said it is permissible to take part in tournaments or in competition providing that no one pays the entry even if it is an essay competition how do we reconcile between these two okay i will answer inshallah it says that there is a well-known hadith that there is no awards uh prizes trophies when competing except if it's on camel's back uh it's hoof of a camel or a horse or in a blade meaning in archery so he says the hadith states that the reward is not permissible except in these three things and you say that competing without an entry fee is permissible when we compete and there's no entry fee so we are two individuals we are competing in table tennis a game of table tennis and someone from the audience says whoever wins gets a thousand dollars prize there's no entry fee there's nothing haram involved what's wrong in that there's nothing wrong the hadith as a number of scholars had referred to deals with betting so the one participating in the race can bet and say that we will win on horseback others say that it's permissible to get prizes from someone else who's involved some say no not all the participant can participate in such gambling because that would be gambling one of them or two of them can put a prize while being included with the competitors while the others won't so there is someone who will break the gap of gambling because he did not put anything while he has a chance of winning everything anyhow the scholars who looked at these hadiths said that this refers to competing and gambling putting prizes from the participants themselves or from someone who's outside whether they would win or lose simply because horse riding in camel's back riding and competing in archery or uh sword fighting these are all attributed to the fighting in in the cause of allah in jihad that's why they permitted it but when you compete in cricket in football in sports and you don't pay any entry fee and someone puts a prize to that this is this is a gift this is a prize from someone who's not having any interest he would not gain anything out of it then there is no nothing wrong in that like when i address 10 boys and i say to them listen i lost my watch on the beach whoever finds it i'll give him 500 reals so they compete in finding it is this haram nobody in his sound mind would say it is haram or it falls under this hadith and allah knows best"
