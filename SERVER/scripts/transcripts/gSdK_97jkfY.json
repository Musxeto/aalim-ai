  "transcript": "is Mil from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam. If a person loves the Prophet ï·º from the heart and out of nowhere he has bad thoughts about him, such as labelling him, but the person tries so hard to suppress it and starts crying and tries to ignore it and ask for forgiveness, did the person leave the fold of Islam? The answer is no. A person does not leave the fold of Islam through these intrusive thoughts that are generated by Satan himself. The Prophet ï·º said in an authentic hadith, Allah, the Almighty has forgiven my ummah for my sake for whatever thoughts that cross their minds as long as they do not speak about it nor act upon it. So these intrusive thoughts that attack us every now and then, Allah mentioned in the last two verses of Surah Al-Baqarah that in the beginning, in the last three verses of Surah Al-Baqarah, in the beginning it was mandated that whatever crosses your mind, Allah will hold you accountable for. The companions came to the Prophet ï·º and said to him, O Prophet of Allah, Allah has ordained upon us difficult things and we have no problem with that. We can pray, we can fast, we can give charity and we can fight in the cause of Allah and offer our lives in jihad, but this verse we can't tolerate. It's too difficult. How is it that we can control our inner thoughts and be held accountable for them? So the Prophet got angry ï·º and he said to them, do you want to say what the Jews said, we hear and we disobey? Rather say, we hear and we adhere and obey. We seek your forgiveness and to you we will return. When they said this with content and acceptance after falling down on their knees and asking Allah for forgiveness, Allah abrogated this by saying, Allah does not hold a soul beyond what it can tolerate and bear and Allah has forgiven our ummah for whatever crosses our minds as long as we don't speak about them and we don't act upon them. So you're safe with the grace of Allah."
