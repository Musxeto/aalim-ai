  "title": "Can we recite Fatiha alongside the Imam? Can we recite it in the gap? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "you said in one of your videos that it's not from the sunnah for imam to pass after the fatiha so that the followers may recite the fatiha behind him and in the quran allah says so we cannot also recite alongside with imam because when the imam recites we should listen to him despite all these facts in the hadith of even summit when sahaba were doing wrath behind prophet sallallahu alaihi the prophet muhammad islam told them not to do except for fatiha so if it is not allowed to reside alongside the imam neither it's from the sunnah for the imam to leave the gap then where the prophet salallahu islam which part did prophet saw advise them to recite the the dead meat is haram for you to consume is it permissible for us to consume fish yes though it's dead we didn't slaughter it we found it floating on the water we took it and ate it no problem in that so how come this is general i am and this is haas this is specific so there is no clash between them all types of dead meat is haram with the exception of the seafood for example this is halal locust found dead this is halal because the sharia tells us it's exempted likewise it is not permissible to recite the quran when the imam is reading it with the exception of al-fatiha and this solves a lot of the problems instead of disregarding one of the evidences by saying that no this does not fit with this one so we have to get rid of it and not consider it no this is combining both evidences now as for the gap the prophet never left the gap so we have to accept this those who described his salat they said between fatih and the surah he was never to leave a gap like we hear the people in haram and other masajid just pausing for a long time this is not from the sunnah they have to prove it whether to read the fatih or not this is an issue of dispute i follow the opinion of imam malik and so does imam ibntamiya when he says that it is recommended to recite it but if you don't recite it your prayer is valid so as long as the imam has recited it in loud prayers i believe that you don't have to if you wish to recite it there's no problem while he's reciting his surah to recite your fatiha and that would be exempted from if the quran were to be recited you have to listen to it so may allah have mercy on you and allah knows best you"
