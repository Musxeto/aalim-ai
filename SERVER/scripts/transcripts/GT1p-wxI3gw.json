  "transcript": "Qasim from Turkey, from Qatar that is Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh Fadhilat, I wanted some clarification on Yom Al-Mittah or Al-Masjid and the oath that we gave. This is with reference to Ayah 172 of Surah Al-Ahraf. Wa Jazakum. I would refrain from answering your question, Brother Qasim, because if I don't have full information of it that I can recall and stand by, I would not risk it. So you can call me on my mobile phone when I'm home so that I can look it up and answer you Insha'Allah some other time. Al-Fatiha."
