  "transcript": "Rameen from France. Yes, hello Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. I wanted to know if the days of the week haram because the origin of those words are from pagan divinities. So what will you do? If I say to you it's haram, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday is haram. Some people say also January is from the god of so-and-so and August is the priest of so-and-so, so it's haram. What are you going to do? Tell me Rameen. Writing or saying them. Yeah, yeah, tell me. So when you have an appointment with a doctor and the doctor says, what day is your appointment? And you say, uh, I can't say Monday because Monday is haram. It's a pagan day. How would he know what you're talking about? Akhi, come on. We, though they have pagan names, we don't believe in that. We just use them to state what day of the week it is, what month of the year it is, and there's totally no problem in using that."
