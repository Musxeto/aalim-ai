  "title": "Showing off WORLDLY knowledge or skills - kufr, shirk, or haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Is it Kufr? and this is from \n[Questioner] . Is it Kufr or Haram   to show off knowledge that is not \nIslamic such as being good in English   or any other worldly skills? No, there is \nnothing Kufr in that. Where is the Kufr?   Again and again and again we tell people. What's \nwrong with you? Why do you consider everything   that is dubious either to be Shirk or Kufr? \nSheikh if I see something and I smile is it Kufr?   If my father did this or that is it Kufr? \nWhy would it be Kufr? Kufr is disbelief.   So what is wrong in bragging about me knowing six \nor seven languages? Or having three or four PhDs   or knowing how to fix the faucet or do the \nplumbing or make a table a wooden table? What's   wrong in bragging about this? Where is the Kufr? \nOr even where is the sin? There is nothing wrong   in that and people should not make things and life \ndifficult for them and for those living with them."
