  "transcript": "Zakariya from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. My question is, yeah, you know, if I wash my feet and put my socks on, yeah, how long can I wipe over them? Like when does it stop? Does it stop from the first time I wash my feet or the first time I wipe over my socks? Okay, the answer is the wiping, the 24 hours starts from the first time you wipe, not from the first time you put on your socks. So for example, if I were to perform wudhu after the Adhan of Fajr, and I put my socks on, I pray Fajr, and then I go to work and I pray Dhuhr with the same wudhu, and I pray Asr, and I pray Maghreb, and maybe I pray Isha. Man, my septic tank is totally full, but some people can go the whole day without visiting the loo, as you guys say in the UK. Then I go to bed, and the following day I wake up for Fajr prayer, I answer the call of nature, and I perform wudhu, and I wipe. Now the 24 hours starts, so I can wipe from this Fajr of the second day till the Fajr of the following day, and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
