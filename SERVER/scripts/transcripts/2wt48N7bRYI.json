  "transcript": "uh abu hafs from bangladesh i'm confused about an issue uh you had given an answer recently it was about buying replicas check you had given uh you had said two views of scholars that is once called one group of scholars said that buying replicas is permissible another group said it is not permissible as these are stolen uh goods now sheikh i assume although i might be wrong i assume that you are inclined to the latter view that it is uh holding to that assumption i have a question regarding three scenarios uh similar uh connected to this that is what what about buying uh replica or cracked softwares and that's scenario one and scenario two is um pre uh taking free uh physical replicas for example uh a shopkeeper is giving away free replica rolex watches it's free i can take it or leave it and the scenario three which is the most no no no this these scenarios are different questions ask me about one scenario please okay okay then i will ask only about one shape but that is uh uh pardon me sheikh that is uh taking uh downloading uh free uh pirated or replica software's namely islamic e-books sometimes especially in case for for me sheikh i cannot afford uh like buying the real books to uh gain the islamic knowledge so sheikh is it permissible for me okay i will answer inshallah abu haas from bangladesh he says that in regards of buying replicas so you said that some scholars said that a replica is actually similar to stolen goods i said some scholars said that i didn't which means that if this is a replica of mambla for example and i buy it from the market for one real would i be buying something stolen the answer is no there is a process of manufacturing of lots of things that is considered to be hard work maybe the design was stolen but the design doesn't mean anything to me so buying a replica i wouldn't say it's haram but i wouldn't recommend it because as my motto is fake products are for fake people when i buy a replica what am i trying to do i know it's not real but i want to convince others that it is real that i am i'm a rich person i'm a sophisticated person which makes me feel so small inside of myself so no buy anything that is not a replica even if it's the cheapest thing but be original from the inside now his specific question about house was about downloading islamic programs that he does not have the money to buy and it it contains a lot of islamic books that he needs in such cases i see that there's no harm in downloading it as long as it's there and available i'm not hacking into someone's software or hardware it's available on the net anyone can download it and it's for personal use not for mass production or for commercial use so if it's for islamic use and for my personal use i see no problem in downloading inshallah you"
