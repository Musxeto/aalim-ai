  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Can I say Assalamu Alaikum or read the Quran when I'm at Junaab? Jazakum Allah Khair Wa Jazakum a person is prohibited from touching or reading the Quran. And this is the most authentic opinion. But such a person is not prevented from saying his night time adhkar, his bed adhkar, praising Allah, saying Assalamu Alaikum, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar, La Ilaha Illa Allah and his bedtime adhkar includes reciting Ayatul Kursi in the last two verses of Suratul Baqarah. Because this is not considered to be as reciting the Quran, rather as the adhkar of the bedtime."
