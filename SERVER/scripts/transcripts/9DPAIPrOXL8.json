  "title": "Are boys / men allowed to study at mixed universities? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "about drama says in my country almost all universities are mixed as far as I know is it allowed for me to help others to get admitted in those places in one such myself by mixed I mean boys sit on the right column and the girls sit on the left but when the teacher is not there they may interact with each other only half of the girls wear hijab but with flashy clothes first of all men are the bread winners of the family so they have to pursue their careers they have to go to universities and studies and study even if it is mixed because it is something that they're forced to do while women are not women are sponsored and provided for by their parents by the brothers by the men in their family husbands and sons etc and this is why I usually say to women or to girls that it is prohibited to work or to study in a mixed environment and this is for the safety of both boy and girl because we know exactly what happens in universities now if there is a segregated class like mentioned here and women are abiding by the hijab not mixing not doing anything this is debatable we can look into it case by case but when there is mixing and intermingling this is not permissible for women men have to do this so is it permissible for you above brahmin to help others get admitted this seems nothing wrong in helping other men or boys to get admitted to such universities and allah azza wajal knows best piazza from saudi did i get the name right make myself Tula yes what can I do for you yes I want to ask my question yeah yes I'm listening yes I want to know the right time to play the solid player okay any more questions"
