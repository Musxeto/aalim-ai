  "transcript": "now though fear sends a question and he says at the start of salaat after saying Allahu Akbar do we need subhanallah subhanallah wa bihamdihi Baraka smoke etiology do kalila hollyrock before or should we read what Joshua G little ad Fatah lacinato the Hannifin before which comes first please advise well his question is made of two questions one can we combine do our least after the inauguration dois because there are a list of them and to which one has a preference first of all so he heard my Muslim Abu Huraira says o prophet of Allah when you begin your prayer you give a short pause what do you say in it because it's silent the Prophet said I was hoping that no one would ask me except you of O Hara Hara because he was keen on seeking knowledge and the Prophet idiso son told him that I say a llama bad vania vania hapara come about mal mashiac will moderate the longed war the well-known dress I had my Muslim or Allah further between me and my sins as you have furthered between the east and west etc another door which are urban hubbub may Allah be pleased with him used to say that the Prophet told us of Hannah column of him dick Tabarrok a smoke with Elijah Duke ah how I look and some scholars say that this is among the best to us to be said because it contains only praise of Allah Georgia but of course hadith of Abu Hurairah isn't so a human Muslim unlike the storm there are other doors but these doors the Prophet you to say to begin his night prayer such as what you have to watch here Latifah taught us about you love there - mookie etc to the end such as Mohammed occurred hampt and Tehama similarly only he never I could have a long I think it was narrated by bass may Allah be pleased with them also saying Allahu Akbar o kabira wal hamdu lillahi kathira wa subhanallahi bukratan wa asila and the list goes on the scholars say that you should not combine more than one you should not say more than one combining two or more is not permissible during salat why because the Prophet had never done this at Isola - sir he used to only recite one form or one type of dois so why do you have a number of draws so that you would concentrate more in your prayer if you continuously since birth till you die you only say it subhanak Elohim dictabird our cosmetology to quarrel and you say this without any contemplation any submissiveness any understanding and so many times I ask people oh hey can you explain this draw for me and they fail and they fail big time so when you change you feel and sense the words that come not from your mouth but rather from your heart because you can feel the difference instead of just repeating it like a parrot without knowing what you're saying a second of all some of the doors as the scholars say are specifically for night prayer such as what you have to watch here a little father-son module are such as alumina can hunt and the famous amytal art such as allahumma rabba gibreel away Ravi Tomica Elif applause similarly Annamalai bajada etc these are for night prayer and one should segregate and not combine this with that and Allah knows best"
