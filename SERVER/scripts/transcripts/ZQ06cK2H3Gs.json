  "title": "Gatherings held to receive condolences and to mourn a deceased | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "taneema says is it necessary for females to go to the house where some far relatives have passed away so basically she's asking about joining gatherings for mourning a person died they allocate a specific time in the day like between mother Benicia you go to the house of the deceased and you find that there are chairs lights people serving coffee in tea and some of them innovate even further so they distribute juzu of quran and say okay let's read it so that 30 of us would finish the Quran collectively and give the reward to the deceased maybe they would have food and gather for a meal or so all of these are innovations mourning the dead does not mean to innovate and gather like this giving your condolences can be done by the phone can be done by visiting them in the morning or seeing them in the souk or in the Masjid or in whenever it is possible to see them but to gather for more mourning and receiving condolences this is part of the Buddha"
