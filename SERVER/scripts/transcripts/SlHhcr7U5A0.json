  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Kashmir there is \nthis weird culture is going on in   our community that when a person dies all of \nhis wealth is taken by the male I mean Sons   and they give nothing to the daughters now through \nthe course of time people are becoming aware   of the fact that sisters also have a right \nin the inheritance of father in the wealth   but there still be a stigma like in which our \nwomen face so whenever we tell our sisters that   you have a right in whatever our father has left \nbecause he has died so they tell us no no we don't   need it's it's like we forgive you and it's a \ngift from us so my question Sheikh can we take   this feeling that they have gifted up yet or there \nis another rule says that a person cannot gift or   give charity his wealth except for the one third \nparty so which among these two should we say so if I understood question he's \ntalking about a prevailing   custom in the community where females are \ndeprived from inheriting so if the father   dies the sons get all the property in order the \nwealth and they deprive the girls the daughters   with the understanding that because this \ndaughter if she gets married to a stranger   he would have a share in our father's property \nthis should be only in our lineage in our family   of course this is from jahiliyah this is a major \nsin and a prohibited act in a transgression and   disbelief in the Quran because the one who divided \nthe wealth of the deceased is no one other than   Allah and Allah knows who's worthy of inheriting \nfrom those who are to be deprived so when you come   and deprive the daughters from inheriting \nyou have committed a grave and major sin   now after people the grace of Allah came to know \nthe ruling they started wanting to give back   and to correct the wrong doing so they went to \ntheir sisters and said listen we deprived it from   your rights here is your share but most likely \nthese sisters are so loving and kind and generous   they're married and they're happy with their \nfamily and they say no it's okay we forgive you   so is it permissible the answer is yes as \nlong as they were wronged and Injustice was   acted upon them and then they forgave   the oppressors and the wrong doers alhamdulillah \nthis is permissible and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
