  "transcript": "him says if i buy a teddy bear for my two-year-old niece for birthday not celebrating with cake or anything just a gift will i be sinful the short answer is yes the long answer is satan has steps and he doesn't come all of a sudden with a major sin or an innovation rather he starts bit by bit he's patient he can wait for tens of years and he doesn't care what counts is that you would fall into sin so do you think if muslims simply exchange gifts on the day of birth of a person that they would just limit it to that now it says of course not look what's happening all over the world the muslim world how all of this began how did all of this begin it began by a one step a single step of satan's followed by another followed by others until we have reached this conclusion so now you see people throwing parties and hotels for birthdays having a birthday cake with candles numbered as his age and with a song happy birthday to you happy birthday dear awesome happy birthday to you and then blowing the candles with a wish that will definitely take place then exchanging gifts all of this started most probably with a gift or even with a congratulation happy birthday full stop but next year the following year you will slowly deteriorate like a man standing in quicksand until it drowns you therefore why emphasize on that particular day out of the 365 days a year because this is what the disbelievers do and imagine what birthdays led them to it led them to christmas it became part of the religion to celebrate the christmas the birthday of jesus peace be upon him look at the super sufis the among the muslims it led them to celebrate the birthday of our prophet muhammad all of this is not part of the religion therefore i highly advise you moyan to ignore such thoughts that come to you you want to be kind to your niece buy her a gift any time of the year take her shopping any time of the year take her to the fun fairs if you wish but not relate this to her birthday"
