  "title": "A man from Ahmadi Sect using Sheikh Assim's platform to spread fitnah & lies | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question was that yesterday you said that ahmadi do not pray fast and don't perform hajj and in your other videos you have said this as well so i just wanted to come clarify that this me you is done so much harm with your videos and mocking me personally with your lies and we don't have to discuss this because ask any muslim who is part of a sunnah al-jamaa or part of the super sufis or even the shia and they will tell you that the khadiyanis are not from islam and they do not belong to the muslim community so it doesn't matter to me whether you're a jew or a christian it's the same so i don't think that it is proper to leave the platform to you to express any more lies than than what you have done in the past razi from canada we we've discontinued that call because i in the past used to entertain his calls on the show and so many muslims bless them came to me through emails telling me that this guy is a devout adiani and he is like their public relations and he has made videos against me about drinking beer and making fun of the sheikh that he drinks beer and i saw some of his lies and i got to know where this guy is coming from to their cult he's doing a good job because he's defending what he believes and definitely satan is happy with him and they are doing a good job what hurts most is that we need dedicated people like this among the muslims who dedicate their lives their times and their efforts to propagate islam real islam from the quran so such voices of evil would not find its way out alhamdulillah this guy by the way i'm not publicizing him because no muslim would definitely watch any of his material because it's blatant cover and lies on all the materials of padiani's baha'is etc they're all not related to islam don't ask me ask any major scholar in islam about them ask the committees of the world muslim league by itself and you will find that they say they're out of the fall of islam go to the azhar go to universities all over the muslim world i'm talking about a 1.7 billion these guys are financed by the brits and they were their cult was created so that they would curb the jihad the concept of jihad and resisting the conqueror the the white skin brits the english army and they made it part of their religion to submit to their orders and to bow to them and to make them use them as steps to put their feet on so this is why it was created and it till date they have great huge support everywhere anyhow they are a minority i don't think there may be like 300 or 400 000 individuals in the whole world nevertheless they are not related to islam but i do invite the muslims from sunnah al-jamaa to gear up and to do whatever they can to devote themselves dedicate themselves for the quran and the sunnah according to the manhattan of the salaf of the three favorite generations so that they would open the eyes that are closed and shed the light in these times of darkness to guide the people in sha allah"
