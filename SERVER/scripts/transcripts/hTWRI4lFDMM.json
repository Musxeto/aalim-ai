  "transcript": "finally suhail says according to islam does the sun revolve around the earth or the earth revolves and rotates around the sun or is the earth stationary this question is always arising and asked by atheists people of bad intent who would like to pinpoint something against islam something against the quran as muslims do we care what they say definitely not as muslims where do we get information and knowledge from the quran and from the sunnah so if we study the quran and the sunnah we will find that allah addresses the layman as he addresses the engineer the professor and the rocket scientist allah addresses them all with what they can comprehend so for us laymen even if you go to atheists when you ask them about the timing of the day he would say to you the sun rises at 7 00 am and it sets at 6 20 pm so he is confirming that it is the sun that rises and sets and if you look in the hadith the hadith of abu dharr may allah be pleased with him when the prophet asked him do you know where the sun goes when it sets and then he told him about the long hadith which approves that the son is the one who's setting or the one that is setting and if you look at the quran you will find this majestic book does neither confirm nor deny some verses well one verse says all earth moon and sun they orbit but orbit what we don't know and we know that the quran is a book that is miraculous for all times and for all places but if you study it it doesn't say neither confirm nor deny that the earth rotates but it shows for those who want to see that the sun rises and sets and this is clear in the quran so now when we find that nasa's scientists come and say no it's the other way around it's the earth rotating the sun and it rotates around its own axle etc as muslims are we obliged to obey what they're saying definitely not because this is a possibility and there is a big possibility that 10 20 years down the line they will come and say oops we made a mistake it doesn't rotate so should we confirm with them or deny them no this doesn't con constitute any of the questions that we will be asking our graves nor on the day of judgment allah will not ask you does the earth rotate or not it's not part of your apida so there's no point of raising such a question and making an issue out of it whether confirming or denying the quran doesn't say as confirmation or denial and the sunnah proves to us that it is the sun that rises and sets like everyone else on the earth sees and confirms only a handful of scientists would say that it doesn't rise and it doesn't set it is the earth that rotates either way this is what they say and what they claim and we're not obliged to believe or deny so i hope this answers your question allah azza knows best you"
