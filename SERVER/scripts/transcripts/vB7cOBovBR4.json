  "title": "Does Rocking in Ruku & Sujood invalidate the prayer",
  "transcript": "from the uk my question is regarding um you said i think or something similar to that if somebody um regarding being at is in salah if somebody were to look at you they would know that you're praying as i was going to say being asian prayer there's a lot of brothers who rock in like they go sideways sometimes um and this happens throughout um the position or sometimes in sejuan they might walk um like side to side but when we look at them we know that they're praying um so with prayer still be valid if that makes sense okay um this does make sense but what they're doing it does not make sense so i would understand that people in record probably would do this because their feet are aching and they're switching between sides due to the blood circulation this doesn't impact the prayer it's not recommended to do but it does not impact the prayer you don't stay and record as a statue and if you make a move then it's you're gone no you're human still slight movement is okay rocking in sujood this is a first i've never seen anybody uh does this but again if it is slight and for a reason this does not impact the sujud allah knows best"
