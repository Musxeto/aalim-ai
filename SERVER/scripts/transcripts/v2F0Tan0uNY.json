  "title": "Did not pay for driving course, is it Haram on me & do I have to pay them back (Cheat)?assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Question is, when I used to go to driving school, we had to pay for like segment one and segment two, and segment two I didn't pay it on purpose. Is it haram on me? Do I have to pay them back or not? So how did they award you the driving license if you did not pay for it? We were supposed to pay them twice and I only paid them once. Okay, I'll answer you inshaAllah. As for the second question, it is a well known fact in Islam that the Prophet ï·º said, those who cheat us are not from among us. Muslims don't lie. Muslims don't cheat. Muslims don't steal. So if you availed or utilized or used their service and did not pay them, you're sinful and you're accountable. And Allah will take the blessing from you one way or the other, in addition to what awaits you on the Day of Judgment of His torment and wrath. So yes, these people trusted you. It's not justifiable to say that oh, they're disbelievers, they're kafir, they're this and they're that. I can cheat them, I can deceive them. No, you have to pay them what they provided you with, and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
