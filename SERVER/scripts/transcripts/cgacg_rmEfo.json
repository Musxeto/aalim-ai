  "title": "Can a Photo Editing company to store info about clients that is not copyright protected",
  "transcript": "from the uk i have a photo editing company um and we deal with images of clients and we store them on our drives and they know that the cars um yeah the cars and we send them back i know you gave me an answer we send them back but um would it be permissible for us um to use a machine learning algorithm to learn from them um um and and obviously the machine learning algorithm would learn from these images um would this be permissible without letting the client know isn't this the client's um property via the sharia thank you yes you did not tell me that you've requested them to sign a contract and they refused so there is no copyright protection am i right or wrong there is no copyright protection at all so this is like someone giving you something and you have all the right to do whatever you want after it's left over because if they had any problem they would have said remove it from the servers give us the original copies do not use our photos for any of your services they did not do that so the sky is the limit i personally believe you should contact your solicitor and ask him if someone were to file a suit against you would that be legal or they would have no basis and the answer would answer your question islamically there is nothing in that inshallah you"
