  "title": "Sea animals including sharks and whales halal? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sidra says I heard your previous post that all sea animals are halal so my question is sea animals also include shark and whale how could they be halal as they eat humans the ayah in the Quran clearly states that anything that lives in water is halal for us to consume the exception would be if it's something harmful so if there is an animal or a fish that if I eat it I get poisoned poisoned and I know this then in this case it cannot be consumed why it falls under the general guidelines because of other general guidelines the Prophet said I am now da-da-da-da-da and Allah said do not throw yourself in harm's way do not kill yourselves and the Prophet said lebara there is no harm to be inflicted by me or to be inflicted by others upon me anything that does this is hallam so sharks whales and the likes are halong even if they consume humans which is rare but they consume other animals and they consume anything that has flesh in it I was a adel who dream allah be pleased with him tells us in the hadith in sahih bukhari and elsewhere that they found a huge whale dead on the beach so they ate from its meat for a whole month and he described this huge whale in a way that is quite strange and shocking but it shows you that whales were eaten at the time of the Prophet Isis am so all types of animals of fish that lives in the sea and cannot live elsewhere they can be eaten regardless of what they consume and Allah knows best"
