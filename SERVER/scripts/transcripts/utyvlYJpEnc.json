  "transcript": "a sister says when I am in my menses can I pretend to pray in front of my brothers so that to avoid their questions so in short the sister has male brothers and usually younger brothers would not know that women have a certain period of the month where they cannot pray or fast so whenever it's time for prayer and they see here especially in Mallory for example or for fuzzy when she doesn't wake up they start asking questions why isn't she praying why is she every single day waking up waking us up and asking us to pray now she's not praying so they would like to insist on her to pray and she is hesitant she says I'm shy what to tell them well this is not a thing to be shy off to pretend that you are praying while you are on your menses some scholars consider this to be an act of apostasy Allah knows that your prayer is invalid you know that your prayer is valid yet you're still pretending to say allahu akbar reading the fat her making recurrence rude to whom you say to allah you know that allah would not accept your prayer while you're in menses okay it's not for Allah it's from my brother so that they won't ask me why I'm not praying then this is even further shirk because you're doing a form of a matter of worship to them no be straightforward just simply tell them that women have a period of the month where they cannot pray if they ask for more explanation tell them that this is females go and ask mom or go and ask that but you must not pretend to do any of this as you have mentioned and allah azzawajal knows best"
