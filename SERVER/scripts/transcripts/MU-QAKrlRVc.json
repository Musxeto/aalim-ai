  "transcript": "we have sister Aisha from Japan I was wearing long white dress for I had a shorter plant with Mongoose salt um thanks for also wider but when I banned for Ruku I found out that my dress would go up a bit and also the plants that I was wearing inside the black as they were also wide and shorter uh would get lifted a bit and from behind a bit of my ankle between pants and socks would be reasonable in Wilko as I was wearing longer socks I thought like my hour would not be visible I prayed many players with it since yesterday's issue time until today and was obligatory ones and look at Players I had makeup players I'm thinking like should I repeat all of my careers they make a lot first of all the issue of prayer is of great importance in our lives now we take a lot of precautions when it comes to our health wearing masks sanitizers social distancing and the likes just simply because we're afraid of a tiny virus but when it comes to Salat we're negligent we're not of this great emphasis on taking care of our prayers and that is wrong now when you pray you have to do your level best because Allah is watching you and a lot of the Muslims when they pray Allah and they don't acknowledge they don't feel when they're approaching the Salat that they are being watched by Allah that would be a game changer it is reported that Zain al-abidine may Allah have mercy on his soul before forming evolution his face used to get yellow and he used to shiver and people his companions students would say what's happening to you and he says to them in a terrified voice don't you know who I'm about to meet when doing Evolution I'm about to meet Allah so do you think that it's a yeah we meet Allah five times a day who gives what we're finished get it over with and move on no this is not how we pray so when you pray next time you do your due diligence that Allah is watching you so that you would perfect your Salat secondly whatever is exposed slightly of your aura for a short period of time unknowingly this is Exempted with the mercy of Allah so because you've done this unknowingly and it was brought to your attention just recently all your previous prayers are valid the amount of Aura was exposed is negligible it's not the big thing and it was for a short period of time that is when you bowed so next time do your level best to wear an ample and long Abaya or a prayer kamis or whatever you you wear on it and make sure that your feet are properly covered and Allah Knows Best foreign"
