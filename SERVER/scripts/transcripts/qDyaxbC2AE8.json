  "transcript": "Iman from Qatar In science class our midterm... Did you say Assalamu Alaikum? Wa Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. In science class our midterm is approaching and our science teacher gives us the exact questions from the test paper and I think this is cheating so if I use these questions to study am I sinful? You have one of two options either you don't study them and fail or you study them and pass. You choose. If the system of the school is corrupt and the management knows about this and they leak the questions either change your school or go with the flow. Most likely the teacher gives you a hundred questions 10 of which will come in the exam and this is not cheating and this is permissible and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
