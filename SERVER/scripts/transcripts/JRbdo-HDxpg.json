  "transcript": "motya Ramon says is it a sin or shirk to migrate for worldly reasons as mentioned in the hadith shirk no it is not migration leaving your Muslim country to live in an unknown country is prohibited the prophet alayhi salat wa salam said i have nothing to do with someone who goes and lives among the disbelievers or the idol worshipers in other narration he was giving the pledge of allegiance to a man and he asked him to do a number of things and among them is to not live among the disbelievers so basically speaking if someone migrates for worldly reasons if someone goes to work abroad in a non-muslim country to gain money to add some worldly value to his experience or life this is permissible if it is temporary but if he goes there and acquires the citizenship or lives there for good this is not permissible unless it has a number of conditions why is it not permissible life there is easy infrastructure is good people are treated equally so they say and claim there's security there is no poverty there's no this and that there's no injustice these are banners and claims that if you look closely and scrutinize the lives of those who live there you would find that it is not true yes there is a lot of good in living in such non-muslim countries there might be a lot of fairness and justice over all there might be a higher standard of living but still it is a non-muslim country still there are numerous sins all around you you cannot trust your children to be brought up in an Islamic fashion and in so many countries you are not allowed to practice your religion freely maybe in some countries you can but in the the enmity and hatred towards Muslims especially immigrants is growing up and you can see that in the way they behave against Muslims if anything that is considered to be hostile or a crime committed they would immediately say the first suspect must be a Muslim this is well known they fight the freedom of religious practice women are unable to wear the niqab in France in in so many parts of Europe and I've always said this and I would like this to be widely spread all over these Muslim these non-muslim countries our sisters who are prevented from wearing the niqab and they will be fined for wearing the niqab just simply wear a medical mask no one can stop you from wearing a medical mask because there's pollution there is flu there are so many germs so the replace your black net up with a green or blue medical facemask that would do the job in sha Allah so basically speaking you can go to such countries if you are unable to practice your Deen if you there is turmoil in your country like Afghanistan and Iraq and you cannot live there without being threatened but other than that you may go for a year or two but you cannot travel or migrate there forever"
