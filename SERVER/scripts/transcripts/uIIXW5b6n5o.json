  "transcript": "Asim says, how to reply to the idol worshippers if they ask us about black stone, being kissed by Muslims? Idol worshippers worship their idols. Muslims do not worship neither the black stone nor the Kaaba. So you have to first open their eyes to what they're doing. When they're worshipping a cow or a statue or a tree or a rock, what do they think of such things? They think that they benefit and bring harm by themselves. That's why they worship these things and they have great honour and glorification and praising to them. They have this fear and hope in these things. This is worship. While the Muslims do not have these feelings to the Kaaba and to the black stone. You've seen so many Muslims climb up the Kaaba and stand on its roof. There's no problem in that. We know the statement of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, when he used to go around the Kaaba in Tawaf and come to the black stone and kiss it and he says to it while addressing those with him, I know that you are a stone that brings no benefit and protects from no harm. Had I not seen the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, kiss you, I would have not had kissed you or touched you. So he is showing and teaching the people that this is a stone. We don't worship it. We don't have any form of thinking that it brings benefit or protect us from harm. And I hope this answers your question."
