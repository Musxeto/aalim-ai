  "transcript": "Abu Uzair? so what are the \nsix exceptions of backbiting oh this is a a quiz no no like like i think \ni know i know i know i understand but i don't   memorize him if i memorize them i would have been \none of the uh major uh ulama uh council but I'm   from the minor small ulima, okay i'll answer \nyou to the best of my knowledge from Holland   he says what are the six exceptions of Gheeba? \nImam nawawi mentioned those and he explained   them there is poetry combining them I don't \nremember what I had for lunch yesterday I'm   too old to do this but generally speaking these \nsix issues relate to advice and warning, so say   they say if someone comes to you to ask you about \na person they're about to get in a business with   and you know that this guy deals in riba and \nsteals money and he would cheat him so you   have to tell that individual no this person does \nthis and that related to his question. If a person got a proposal from a man who's interested in his \ndaughter or his sister and you know that this guy   is a junkie or a drunkard or he doesn't pray \nbut nobody knows this about him, you do so you   have to warn him, if you have a problem with \nsomeone that requires you going to the judge   and you say this man broke into my house and stole \nmy wallet, no one would say that oh okay this   is backbiting (gheeba), no you have to do this \nyou have to tell the police you have to tell the   judge about the crime he had committed and this is \nnot backbiting. If you know of a person going to   seek knowledge from someone who's not trustworthy \nnot a scholar not from ahle sunnah ti wal jamaa   rather he's an innovator or he has corrupt Aqeedah \nand you have solid proof that the knowledge he's   giving is totally bogus and corrupt not because \nhe made one single mistake in his lifetime   you tarnish his reputation, no I'm talking about \npeople of deviancy of Biddah, then yes you have to   warn the individual by saying that this is not uh \na good person to learn from it's haram for you etc   i don't know four or five maybe i don't know who's \ncounting uh number six maybe just to conclude if   i can warn someone who has authority over someone \nwho's below him. So i know a friend who does drugs   or i know a girl who's behind her father's back \nis having an affair with a boy and i've advised   these people and they would not listen if i advise \nor talk to her father or his elder brother and say   listen akhi your brother is doing this and \nthis and this and i'd like you to intervene   diplomatically in a good way find out for yourself \nand then try to stop him from doing haram that's   good so I hope these are the six roughly i'm \nnot sure nevertheless, Al imam al Shawkani may Allah have mercy on his soul went a bit \nfurther and he said I don't agree with these   six exceptions because you can warn people in most \nof them other than the police and the judge stuff   when someone asks you for your opinion \nabout what do you think of Sheikh so and so   who gives tafsir or who teaches Aqeedah or who \nteaches and i know that he's not good to teach   not because i'm jealous of him not \nbecause he's making a lot of money   simply because we have the facts in \nblack and white he's not qualified   he he's been deviant for so many years if \nI can warn people who trust me and seek   my advice without mentioning his flaws so \nhe says can I learn arabic from so and so?   and I say I don't advise you to do so he says \nwhy he said you asked me for advice I gave you my   advice you want to know why you have to do your \nhomework I'm not going to go deeper than that.   This as imam Shawkani says is a higher and better \nstance when you warn people and Allah knows Best."
