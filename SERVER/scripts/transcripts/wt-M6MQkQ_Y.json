  "transcript": "Muhammad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I have a question regarding the missed prayers As we know a person isn't sinful for missing a prayer due to sleep and forgetfulness provided he makes up for it as soon as he remembers it My question is if I realize it is the time of prayer and then forget it or sleep through it am I sinful? For example I wake up for Fajr to turn off my alarm and realize the alarm has gone off but I fall asleep again and miss it Similarly I was aware for the time of Dhuhr but got caught up in some work and intended to pray it later before Asr but then forgot and missed it Am I sinful despite having the intention of praying and can I make that prayer up? JazakAllah For the Fajr prayer if you woke up and turned off the alarm with the intention of praying it but fell asleep you are not sinful because you had the original intention If you turned it off to go back to sleep knowing that you're not going to wake up no you're sinful Similarly for Dhuhr if you did not pray Dhuhr with the congregation and said okay I have two hours for Asr let me pray it you're not sinful for delaying it within the time of two hours If you forgot until Asr time was called there is no sin in you because you have forgotten"
