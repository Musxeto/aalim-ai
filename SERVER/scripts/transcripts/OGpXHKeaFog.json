  "title": "Can I give my dad zakat money to pay off his loans? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "samaya says my dad has a lot of loans and it's difficult for him to make ends meet can I give him my zakat money to pay off his debts first of all the scholars say that it is not permissible to give zakat money to those whom you are responsible for providing for such as your children and offspring and your parents even if they go up ancestors so it is my duty to provide from my father my mother my wife and my children this is an obligation when I give them zakat which is due on my wealth I am actually trying to make a shortcut so I would be saving money I have to give my parents my children my wife an X amount of money and I have to give zakat an X amount of money so by merging them two together I am saving myself an X amount of money and this is totally prohibited and it's not permissible in Islam however scholars said and this is the choice have you been bears even if they mean and all great scholars of Islam they said that if one of those whom you are responsible to provide for has debts on them paying off their debts is not your obligation what do you mean I married a woman and this woman has student loans so after marriage she's obliged to pay her students loans and she doesn't have money scholars say say that because she's in debt it is permissible for me to give her my zakat to pay off her debts okay isn't this part of providing for her the answer is no providing for her is to give her shelter clothes food and medicine when she's sick that's it but paying off her debts is something extra which is not an obligation upon me which means that if my father has loans I'm not obliged to pay or to participate in paying off his loans because this is his problem with all due respect he's my father but it's not my responsibility so if I have wealth and I have the cat and he is eligible to receive the cat to pay off only his debts in this case I can do that providing that his debts are not interest because I cannot assist someone who has interest based loans and paying them off this is part of endorsing RIBA and encouraging him to take more and more loans and a large L knows best"
