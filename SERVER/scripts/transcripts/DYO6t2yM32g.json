  "title": "Is wiping the face after Wudu permissible as sins get wiped? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdulla says I heard a hadith that we must not wipe our faces after woudl because every drop that falls indicates that a sin is forgiven is that true the answer is no this is not true at all the issue of washing your face and your arms and the sins fall with the last drop that comes out from your face from your beard from your arms this is authentic but it doesn't say that if I wipe these organs that the sins will not go away no there's a hadith where the Prophet Isis unperformed loulou and one of the mothers of the believers came to him with a towel so he did this he rejected it this is one single hadith some scholars said that ah this is because it's best to have it dry by itself but there is no indication in the idea ton whatsoever it could have been that the Prophet was hot he didn't want to dry it he wanted to cool down it could have been that the towel given to him had something that repelled him and he did not feel good about it there can be a number of reasons but there is nothing at all wrong in wiping and drying your limbs after performing woudl and the Lazo jal knows best"
