  "title": "Do I have to Repeat Ruqyah (Night Athkaar) again if I get up at night? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Injeral from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question was regarding Ruqya, especially when I'm doing Ruqya before sleeping. So if I do Ruqya and go to sleep, if I wake up in the middle of the night and, you know, do praying or whatever, and go back to bed, do I have to do Ruqya again? What is the meaning of Ruqya in general? Okay, I will answer you. There is a difference, my friend, between Ruqya and Adhkar. Adhkar is a set of phrases and prophetic hadiths and verses of the Qur'an that we say in the morning and evening time, after Fard prayer, before going to bed, before leaving the home, before eating, after eating, before entering the toilet, so many things. These are called Adhkar, and these are mentioned in the small booklet, Fortress of the Muslim, which Allah blessed me to explain, and it's on YouTube, on my channel, and elsewhere. Ruqya is a set of verses of the Qur'an and prophet's sayings and supplications only specifically recited to uplift an illness, a disease, evil eye, envy, black magic, or jinn possession, and the likes. So if you have harm, or you're affected by evil spirits, or a disease, or something that aches you, and pain in your body, you do Ruqya. So now you're referring to Adhkar of bed, or before going to bed. And the answer is, if you say it before you go to bed, and you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet, or to pray, and then you want to go again to bed, you are not required to say them again, because the first time is sufficient for you, and Allah knows best."
