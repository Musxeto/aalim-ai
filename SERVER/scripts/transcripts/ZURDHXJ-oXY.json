  "transcript": "a high D from the Emirates uh so I want to ask one of your questions just to clarify previous program you said that due to overslept if you miss your prayer so when you open your eyes anytime you can offer the prayers my question is that what do you mean by this if I overslept in massage your time or if I over slept on the other time so there is any cap of it within two hours you need to uh also your prayers kindly thank you so much Heidi every prayer has a time for beginning you cannot pray before that in a time that it ends you can't pray it after that so for example prayer when the son goes to the West and there is a slight shade of an erected object to the east this is called zawal this is where the time of Zohar starts so you can't pray before that so let's assume it's 12 o'clock then you have to begin your prayer at 12. when does it end the shade continues as the sun goes towards the West continues to grow longer to the east until the length of the shade is equivalent to the erected object once the length of directed object is equivalent to its shade this is the end of the and the beginning of Asar here you cannot pray Zohar anymore because the time has expired what the Hadith says is as follows whoever forgets or oversleeps a prayer he must pray it as soon as he remembers it meaning remember or wake up there is no expiation for it other than that so if I pray the prayer from 12 to let's say three where the answer time begins I'm fine I have no problem if I pray 1201 then I'm fine if I prayed five minutes to three then I'm fine the issue is if I want to pray it after three o'clock which is awesome time onwards due to forgetfulness I was so busy I totally forgot I did not pray I remembered at four o'clock what to do the prophet says pray it immediately I woke up at four o'clock what to do the prophet says pray it immediately immediately here is relative meaning don't go and take a shower and do your hair and may do your makeup have few calls do a few posts on Instagram and check your Facebook and Twitter then you go and pray no you have to as soon as you wake up do whatever is necessary and make Odo and pray so I hope this answers your question"
