  "transcript": "Sarah from the Emirates uh my question is that uh before my marriage uh me and my husband loved each other a lot and had physical intimacy I repented from it but still I consider it a very good time of my life because we had love does missing it or looking at old photos of us affect my repentance or it just makes me sinful because it's human nature to miss something they have lost and I wish for that time to come back in my marriage I hope I'm not sinful for considering it a good time and looking at old photos where we were happy or laughing at some old moments which were funny but sinful and it doesn't affect my repentance or ncah and I'm not proud of my major sins like adultery okay first of all your repentance is not affected because it was genuine at the time before you married so your nikah is valid this is out of the way are you sinful the answer is yes when you recall times of sins where you were doing a major sin and you reflect and Ponder upon on the good times of sinning of disobeying Allah and miss these old good days this is a breach in your remorse yes your repentance is gone it's related to that marriage it's marriage is valid afterwards if you sort of reject the remorse and the repentance and you wish you had a glimpse of these good old times this impacts your repentance big time and your remorse so you have to be again fearful of Allah you have to be afraid whether Allah accepted your repentance or rejected it whether you will be punished for it in your grave and afterwards on the day of judgment or Allah Asel had accepted your repentance and forgiven and pardoned your sins this is a very serious issue and you have to be more careful if you've lost the love that you had in the past you have to audit your marriage why did I lose it what has what has changed in our lives you will always find reasons to blame your husband oh he changed oh he did this he he used to do this he used to do that but you'll never be fair enough to say well actually I gained a lot of weight I'm not taking care of myself I'm not as humorous and funny as I used to be I'm always nagging and demanding and complaining of everything this impacts the love between the spouses big time so you can still rekindle the love if you audit your marriage once again"
