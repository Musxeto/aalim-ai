  "title": "How can a woman who is praying at home make dua between Athaan & Iqamah when she cannot hear it?",
  "transcript": "says since a woman performs prayer at home by herself so how is she supposed to make dua between athan and the akama the prophet said ali is that the dua between the athan and the akama is answered which makes this time among the times where the dua is answered and it's preferred to make dua so tasfia says she's a woman may she may not hear the akama in the masjid and the prophet did not mention the masjid he mentioned the time between the adhan which indicates that the time of prayer has started and the time when you begin to perform your father prayer so if it is maghrib usually it is 10 minutes apart from the masjid but if i were to be pray home the adhan is at six o'clock i prefer to pray at 6 30. so i have 30 minutes 20 minutes more than the time of the masjid because i'm praying home and my akama is at 6 30. this means that from 6 till 6 30 my dua would be heard and answered so i can make dua as long as i wish in that time to recap any woman wanting to make dua the moment the time is due which is uh identified by the adhan till the time she stands for her own father prayer this is a time for dua for her and allah knows best you"
