  "transcript": "the next question is again a little bit off the subject but the sister seems to be a bit worried i'm trying to conceive for the last three years some people recommend me to pray is the khara and some tell me to pray the hajjit what should i do these two things have nothing to do with conceiving you have to you have to do ivf your husband has to work overtime is a misconception among most muslims is not asking allah to do something for you is whether i should buy this bottle or this i ipod i think it's called um i don't know i should replace the hara no wrong what should i do focus what do you want to do well actually i think i go for the ipods that sure definitely i want to buy this now you press tihara and in your sahara you're actually asking allah begging allah azza to make it happen if there's any good for it in it for you or allamic it happened for me if not then let it go away and take my passion away from it and decree what is best for me and let me be happy with that that's it has nothing to do with the water tahajjud is night prayer of course night prayer is the uh uh ultimate time for begging allah so yes you can ask allah azza whatever you want but again it has nothing to do with ivf specifically it has to do with paying a few debts of making your husband the righteous one to protect you from your mother-in-law's abuse all everything the whole nine yards but not specifically for uh conceiving conceiving is just making dua through the five daily prayers when you're making sujud or univoluntary prayers when you're making make dua and allah is all hearing and all seeing subhanahu tan for the clarification"
