  "transcript": "Uzair from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam So my question is if someone denies something of Islam and later believes in it and takes a shahada, is there any repentance required or is the repentance done just accepting it again? No, his repentance is by accepting it and reverting to Islam again. That is his repentance and that would erase his previous sins with the grace of Allah."
