  "transcript": "Abdullah from Russia can you hear me so I had a deal uh with a Muslim man the conditions were that I loan him uh something of my stuff and if he doesn't return it he will give me all his Good Deeds on the day of judgment so the question is is this condition valid and is his uh that this situation is actually valid we let no no this is this is not valid at all and it's unacceptable and it's not up to him to give you a single Good Deed let alone all of his good deeds and asking him for such a price is ridiculous you want him to give you everything in in Return of worldly matters what kind of a transaction is this no this is totally bogus and Haram and it can also involve riba though the transaction itself is not valid because you're giving him $1,000 and you're getting in return what's worth a million dollars though you're not going to get a single thing because this transaction is invalid what you gave you should get in return otherwise if he fails to do so you evaluate it and get its value in cash if he fails to do so again you will take the value of that cash on the day of judgment from his Good Deeds but not all"
