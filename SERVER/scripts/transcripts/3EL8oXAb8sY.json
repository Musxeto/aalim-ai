  "transcript": "Hala from France yes yes sir I know that when we observe our five daily prayers Allah subhah wa ta'ala will protect us from encountering our enemies and prevents them from harming us but for me I find it difficult to pray F and some prayers on time because of black magic and am I good if I pray it when I'm feeling better or I am out of the food of hislam Sir first of all as long as you try your level best to pray on time however you're prevented due to something that is within without that is not within your ability or control such as black magic or seizures or fainting and you skip the daily prayer because of these uh um circumstances Allah will not hold you accountable because Allah does not hold a soul Beyond beyond what it can bear stating that observing the five daily prayers protect us from our enemies this is a broad statement and it's not entirely true we could pray five times a day and still be attacked by enemies or killed or ambushed or uh uh evil happening to us these are two separate things yes generally speaking Allah will protect those who pray on time but it's not in necessity that it is a shield that nothing could harm us this is not uh true uh and Allah Knows Best"
