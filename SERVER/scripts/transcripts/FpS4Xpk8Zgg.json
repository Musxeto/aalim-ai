  "transcript": "april from the philippines Sheikh is taking over the business or \ntaking any percentage of collateral property   halal? [Sheikh]: Come again? Explain \nthat please? [Questioner]: there's a   property that has been collateral and then if i \nwill take over that business and i will take the   amount or i'll take any percentage of that income \nit's not income permissible i have no idea if it's   a collateral and there is a partnership and there \nare people owning it you cannot just overcome   their shares and take the profit and conquer \neverything this is not halal there has to be   agreement because the prophet ﷺ said in the \nfarewell uh a hajj farewell pilgrimage he said to   the people that your wealth your reputation your \nuh physical uh safety upon one another is haram   as the sanctuary of this land in this sacred \nmonth in the sacred day so the prophet ﷺ   prohibited us from consuming other people's wealth \nor transgressing upon them if there is a company   that we're partners in and all of a sudden one \nof the partners is not doing his due diligence   so i take over the business that doesn't mean that \ni also take over his share of 30 percent and the   profits and oust him without any legitimacy \nno i have to buy his share uh out we have to   agree on that he has to be uh in agreement to that \nhe gives his consent he's happy with what we've   reached as a decision not simply to overpower him \nand throw him out by force in allah knows best you"
