  "transcript": "Interim from Australia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I barely can hear you Assalamu Alaikum Can you hear me now? Yeah, but you have to speak up I'm shouting here in the studio Sorry, I'm trying not to disturb others who are sleeping close by I was wondering when we are praying in the Jama'ah and if the Imam pulls us to replace him if he has broken his wudu and he is reciting Fatiha where should we continue from in that case? Should we start from the beginning or just the previous ayah or just continue directly? Okay, if the Imam has a legitimate reason to replace someone else in his place so the Imam is leading the prayer and he remembers that he does not have wudu or he breaks his wudu or he gets a stroke any legitimate reason may Allah protect us all and he deputizes someone behind him so usually the first one or the second one behind him comes in his place either by the Imam pulling him and the Imam leaving or if the guy falls for one reason or the other then a person steps forward if the Imam has recited the Fatiha which is a pillar we carry afterwards so the man who comes in recites if the Imam interrupted the Fatiha then it's best for the man who replaces him to recite the Fatiha from the beginning if he completes it, that's fine but if he recites it from the beginning that is fine so if the Imam before leaving his post has finished the Fatiha this is a pillar the one replacing him can recite anything from the Quran or can go to ruku' immediately that is not a problem www.mooji.org"
