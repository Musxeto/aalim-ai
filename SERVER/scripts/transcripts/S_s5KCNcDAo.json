  "transcript": "Suleyman from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh may Allah bless your house in Jannah and put many air conditioners in it Ameen Sheikh my question is regarding the blissful ignorance of others who accidentally break the fast during the fasting hours of Ramadan. During the fasting hours of Ramadan, if a friend is about to take out a water bottle to drink, is it obligatory for me to stop him or is Allah feeding him and I should abstain? JazakAllahu Khair Wa Jazakum. No, this is mandatory upon you to remind him. If a person is about to drink or eat during the daytime of Ramadan out of forgetfulness, then it is not permissible for you to say, well, Allah is feeding him and giving him drink, let him enjoy it. No, you have to stop him. Likewise, if someone is asleep when it's Fajr time and you say, well, he's asleep, let him sleep until it's 10 or 11 a.m. No, wake him up for Fajr. This is mandatory upon you."
