  "transcript": "sally from germany so they say that washing the face and wudu has to be from ear to ear is it included in wudu the ears the answer is no of course not it has to be from here so it's from this to the other side uh uh of the face the ears are not included your earrings are not included and the technicality is that some people say that okay i left like one centimeter or half a centimeter between my ear and my sideburns would that be considered to be nullifying this technicality came from the scholars of of schools of thought it wasn't mentioned in the hadith in the hadith it was mentioned to wash your face what is face in arabic it is what faces people so this is my face this little half a centimeter or uh here or there nobody talked about it at the time of the prophet saw the companions to my knowledge so to go into such minute details it's like what the english say the devil is in the details this what makes your life difficult oh sheikh the splashes that i may have felt on the back of my shoulder while urinating the devil is in the details generally speaking you urinate you wash yourself you leave with total ease without getting these confusions in the swastika"
