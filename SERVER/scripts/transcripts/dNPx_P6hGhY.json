  "title": "Is my fast valid if I sleep all day during Ramadan?",
  "transcript": "next question is from brother william thomas mclean assalamu alaikum is it first permissible to sleep the day away during ramadan or must we make up the lost hours of fasting at nighttime during the whole day your fasting is not affected by that because what is obligatory upon you to do is to intend fasting the day which you do before fajr time and you refrain from eating drinking and the rest of the things that nullify your fasting from the break of dawn till sunset whether you're asleep you're awake you're at the gym you're at work this has no impact on the validity of your fasting but of course you have to observe the prayers on time etc and you also have to try your level best to utilize your time while fasting instead of spending it sleeping but the validity it is still valid you"
