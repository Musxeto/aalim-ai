  "title": "Can we eat cake, bread, etc from Non Muslims if we do not know the origin of the food Singapore",
  "transcript": "my question is um for you know people living in a muslim country in general the default is that the food available are halal for them to eat as for those who are living in non-muslim countries like in singapore we look at a certified halal certification there is a certification but if let's say someone a non-muslim gives me a food let's say a cake or any pastry that we are not sure if there is let's say alcohol or derivatives of animals that are not slaughtered the proper way um what's the um what's the right way to go about for for this do we still is it better to eat something that's uh certified by the islamic society or it's okay to to eat okay isharaq from singapore says when we are in a non-muslim country and we are given some sort of food like cakes breads etc and we don't know what the the origin of such food is what should we do when we talk about general food that are not non-veg in the sense that such food is um bread we're talking about cakes we're talking about candies these things normally don't contain haram ingredients normally so there is no problem in buying cheese buying bread buying cake when we talk about non-veg such as things that have meat in them if you are in a country that is predominantly christian then the food there the meat there is halal for you by default unless proven otherwise unless proven that it is pork or it was not slaughtered in this case totally becomes haram so singapore to my knowledge is not a christian country it's a kafir country there are lots of uh what do we call them buddhists maybe hindus i don't know about their culture so this is something different because it's not a christian country and hence if you get gifts that contain turkey or it contains meat or contains things derived from it you should refrain from it until proven that it is halal so as long as the label is there this is halal"
