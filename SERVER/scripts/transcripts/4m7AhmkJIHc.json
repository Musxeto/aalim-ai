  "transcript": "Ahnaf from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu We know that FIFA is halal but nowadays they have added female referees and female linesmen. We have no choice to pick as the game randomly picks between the genders. They can be seen in cut scenes from time to time which is capable but still visible for a short while and the female What do you mean we have no choice? I mean that we cannot pick whether there will be a male like referee or a female. Yes but you can pick not to play. Yes sir, this is what I was asking. SubhanAllah, come on Ya Ahnaf, having females in video games is permissible when these females are drawings, are cartoons and they do not provoke any fitna or sexual desires. I've never seen FIFA in my life to tell you the truth. I've never played it. I've never seen it live because Alhamdulillah I'm not exposed to it but I would expect that these players and the referees are almost close to reality which means that the thighs and the curves of the body are the same and the long hair in a ponytail is the same. So this is not permissible for you to play many other games that have no haram components in them that you can play and at the end of the day even if you don't play anything you're not gonna die. It's not like food and water that are essential for your livelihood but your religion is. Your religion is more important than your food and water and this is why we fast for 15 or 16 hours to comply with Allah's commands and be true submitting Muslims."
