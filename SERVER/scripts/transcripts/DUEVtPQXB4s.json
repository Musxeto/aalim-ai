  "title": "Should I Trust The Halal Certificate In A Non Muslim Country? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Saaqib from India Sheikh I have a question that I live in a Muslim majority state and food item and fast food restaurant which are all over the world they have Halal certificate so I should trust that or not because in various Indian states they also say that it's Halal should I trust the certificate or not? As long as there is no reason for you to doubt those who had issued this certificate I see no problem in trusting it especially if you live in a majority dominated Muslim state and especially when we know that those who usually slaughter sheep and cows in India are Muslims the other faiths don't deal with this because it's not permissible in their religion so they claim so I believe that there is no problem in that Inshallahu Azzawajal have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it Insha Allah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all by the will of Allah."
