  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my question is my sister she was trying to determine her purity and she checked once with a cotton and the first time it came out not not pure so it was great and then she did it a second time in the same sitting and then it came out pure so as I didn't know what to say to her she came to me for advice and I told her since this doubt now just wait for the second prayer and then the second prayer she was pure and then she did so so was she supposed to pray the first prayer yes she was supposed to pray the first prayer because she saw her purity and she has to repeat that prayer that she has missed and Allah knows best"
