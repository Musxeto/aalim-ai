  "transcript": "leila from pakistan um jake my question is bit long but i'm very confused about it so it's about that sometimes i get so confused that allah says in the quran truly through the remembrance of allah has find peace and indeed it is but on the other hand i see people there are so many people i see even my close relatives um first of all they're earning haram and they i and i think they don't miss a time when they're disappointed they're not displaying allah and also sometimes they prefer umrah i don't know it's on or what something comes in my mind that look whether they're earning haram but allah still loves them and giving them guidance so it's okay so one is earning haram and do haram things but still they are peaceful while doing these things and maybe on the judgment uh day of judgment allah forgive you and forgive them as well even they disobey allah this is about allah life so what to do i'm very confused about it and i don't know okay i will answer you inshallah um layla from pakistan is confused about how is it possible that some people may sin earn haram and probably perform umrah and do righteous deeds and allah azza keeps on giving them wealth and it seems to us that they are being given the peace of mind so she's confused about this well first of all it is not our responsibility to judge people and those who judge others are the most miserable people on earth because they see things they cannot comprehend or understand and this spoils their life and this spoils the piece of mind they may have when i keep on looking at my rebada my forms of worship i pray on the masjid i fast ramadan i try my level best to stay away from haram i offer tarawih i offer umrah i give in charity i'm quite content that i'm trying my level best to follow the sunnah and to be abiding by the sharia yet i may not be what i want to be in so many different aspects and then when i look at someone else they don't do half of what i do yet allah privileged them with wealth with health with spouses with children with success and i keep on saying how could that be when i see that i've refrained from many haram things i could have been engaged in because i fear allah and i see that nothing has changed when others who got engaged in haram things which declined and rejected allah poured from his grace and wealth upon them and there as if this struck the jackpot here is where shaytan messes up with my head like he's messing up with yours life is a test allah gives the disbelievers from this dunya without account and the believers who worship him allah may test them with poverty and illness and insecurity this is a test for them they would say why is allah doing this for to us this is a probably because we're not on the right path maybe islam is not the right religion and it's a test for the disbelievers when they say listen we say that allah is one of three and if he did not like that he would not have given us this power and wealth and health and all these beautiful things in life so this must mean that we are on the right path path it is a test for everyone so again what defines you is the quran the sunnah what tells you what's right and wrong is shariah look into it and if the people are abiding by sharia allah then they are on the right track if not allah is testing them so don't fail the test like they had done so you"
