  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India oh Sheikh I was studying pillars and conditions \nof Kalima tawhid so I would like to know what are   the consequences if we miss pillar and condition \neither deliberately or due to ignorance or due to   forgetfulness okay these conditions actually the \nseven conditions whether it's sincerity or yakin   or honesty or Etc these are listed and placed \nby Scholars of a very high magnitude and level   and they try to perfect your Islam to the best \nof their ability by listing these conditions   unfortunately this may backfire to Layman and it \ndoes a lot so when Layman read these conditions   and they start to contemplate upon them they \nstart doubting their Islam do I have sincerity   do I have a honesty and Truth in it do I \nhave acceptance fully to it do I have yaquin   do I have do I and then it yeah uh goes out of \nproportion for us Layman just believe in Allah   and avoid anything that goes against \nit embrace it love it and implement it   in your life and that would do the job \ninsha Allah the more you read the Quran   and become familiar with it the more you read \nthe Sunnah and get acquainted with it after   sometime six months a year when you feel that a \nman is strong in your heart you can then go to   commentary of Scholars about these conditions so \nthat you can relate to your Iman and you will feel   that okay now it fits like a glove not now now \nit would be a problem for you and it would open   doubts and Whispers of shaytan \nWithout End and Allah Knows Best"
