  "transcript": "uh ahmad from south africa my question is my full name is ahmed khudbuddin parker it is not a sunni name if i would with the will of allah study islam abroad and according to the sunnah insha allah and become a sheikh my full name would wouldn't be so pleasant and i wouldn't want to let people be deceived by it and would be a bad example so is it permissible for me to change my last name or from parker to my maternal grandfather's name which is normal muhammad passing and i believe could putin is also a sufi name apparently if i'm right which is my father's name so will it be better for him to change it or should i change it for my name uh from south africa he says his name is ahmad but dean parker and he wants to study islam so he wants to change his name ahmad i am so happy you called study islam quickly because your conclusions are all wrong first of all parker as a last name has nothing to do with being a die parker is a well-known uh family i think in india and lots of people are known as parker so what what's wrong in that there's no problem at all in having such a name sometimes it's an advantage when you're giving tao to non-muslims when they hear your name as al-hakim or something of an arab origin okay but when they say oh here's mr parker oh mr parker how are you this opens doors for you so there's nothing wrong in your family name secondly it is totally prohibited and a major sin to change your name into your maternal grandfather or maternal uh ancestors totally prohibited thirdly is a makru name not because of a sufi origin but because it's related to deen or islam yet sheikh islam even his name was and he said that i don't like the name but everybody knows me by it so it's totally legit to keep all these names don't change anything study islam"
