  "title": "Does licking lips break the fast? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "CD from Germany so um my question is if a person is fasting and more saliva is running in his mouth and if he's talking or reciting Quran some of his saliva is reaching uh out of his mouth and lands on his lips so will his will his fasing be broken if he swallowed the saliva that was on on his lip now many people ask this question and they give give a description that when you imagine it you feel grossed with it so as if you're drooling and saliva is coming in rivers and you just go and eat them and lick them this is gross man what is this it's a single tiny drop of your saliva that may come to your lips and you do this and it's gone so the scholars have different opinion as usual in everything some schools of thought say that this has gone outside of your mouth so uh licking your lip would be a form of getting something inside which was not inside so it breaks your um fasting other Scholars say that no if it's like a threadlike it's very thin it's very negligible and you lick your lips it does not impact your fasting and this is the most logical uh opinion as there is no clearcut answer to it but this is not my biggest problem my biggest problem is with those who have OCD who overthink I know people who call me and they say they keep on spitting the saliva it's in their mouth they keep on spitting all day long and you can imagine how dry their mouths are and how bad this is for them physically and medically but this there's nothing wrong in swallowing your own saliva it's inside of your body when you make woodo and you spit what's in your mouth wouldn't be there a little residue of the water what are you going to do bring a vacuum cleaner and put it in your mouth to suck everything in it this is illogical so such overthinking and exaggeration is ways of Shan to mess up with your head so there's nothing wrong and it does not impact your for fasting inshallah"
