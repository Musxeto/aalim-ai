  "transcript": "uh sami from the u.s um so we the question is we operate a trucking business in the united states and we obviously have truck drivers so when we find loads for the truck drivers we negotiate the price with the brokers is it permissible for us to show the drivers as the let's say from point a to point b the truck load rate is one thousand dollars to show them as one thousand dollars but we negotiate the prices one thousand two hundred dollars on top of one thousand dollars that we show to the driver we also charge 16 uh for for our fees and then um and the money that is kept out of uh one thousand two hundred dollars which is two hundred dollars we use we reused for the driver for the upcoming weeks if the week is slow is that permissible first of all is the driver a freelancer or uh on your payroll uh the the we have different types of drivers uh we have drivers that work for us for uh 60 cents a mile and we have a lease drivers that we just charge them 16 okay so what does it make uh what difference does it make if you tell them that i'm gonna pay you a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or one hundred dollars because this is negotiation you're the owner of the truck yes or you're just the provider of the job the the thing is uh some weeks they are very slow no loads at all and then you know we you know just give that money as a bonus or add to the to their next payroll yeah but in order to keep the balance and the relationship with the business so i i still this needs a lot of clarification sami i'm afraid that i have to speak to you more and more about this just to know the nature of the job and the relationship between the driver and yourself and i'll i'll come to mention this inshallah in the answer coming from the u.s the relationship sammy between me and someone that works for me he's either a partner in a transaction so someone comes to me and he says okay i'd like you to deliver this mug to las vegas and i'll give you ten thousand dollars said okay i go to a truck driver he has his own truck he's a freelancer and i say listen i've got a deal for you i'd like you to take this cup this mug to las vegas for 500 any problem no problem he has the free will to say yes or no he doesn't work for me he's a freelance i'm not obliged to tell him that i'm charging ten thousand dollars so there's no problem with that he can be a partner and in partnerships there has to be transparency so he has to know exactly how much i'm making out of it what are my expenses and what is his share he can be an employee of mine so he's on my payroll i give him 3500 dollars a month in order to work approximately like maybe 55 or 60 hours a week and if he does this everything is fine if he does more i give him bonus i give him um overtime whatever i don't have to tell him that i'm charging 10 000 or one dollar for this mug he has to work and do that so in order for us to understand the relationship first we have to understand what is the relationship between me and this person working for me and after understanding i can tell you whether you can disclose or conceal how much you're getting for this uh transaction from a broker or from the same person that needs this transportation"
