  "title": "If he comitted Kufr before but is now practicing, should he say Shahada or repent & is he a Kafir if",
  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaikumussalam Sheikh, so if someone starts to be a practicing Muslim but he remembers that he did acts, if he remembers that he did acts of Kufr and were to repent, to be able to repent for them, would he have to say the Shahada again even though he says it multiple times in the prayer or would he just have to repent from it and if he doesn't repent from it knowing that he did it, is he a Kafir? First of all, why do Muslims tend to make life difficult? I don't have a clue. Whenever someone has zero knowledge of Aqeedah, of Islam, of what Tawheed is, Shaytan plays with him hockey, he plays with him cricket, he plays with him whatever game he wants because you are so vulnerable, all your defenses are down and low, so he messes up with your head. Now, first of all, how difficult is it to announce the Shahada? Ash'hadu an la ilaha illallah Boom! End of story. So if I remembered something that was Kufr or Shirk, I'm doubtful, hmmm, that was like 10 years ago. I prayed so many times, I went for Hajj, I did Ramadan, I read the Quran every day. Should I say the Shahada or no, it's enough? Akhi, if you say the Shahada, how long is it going to take you? A couple of seconds. Asking this question took you half a minute, so feasibly, it's no-brainer to say the Shahada. Number two, if you don't say the Shahada and you continue because remorse is filling your heart, you've repented, you pray, so be it, move on, there's no need to say the Shahada. So either way, why do you complicate things? Answer, because you've opened the Pandora box for Shaytan, he's messing up with your head, you gave him leeway, he has the opportunity because you allowed him to do so. Read and learn about your religion properly and you will never have these whispers again. Thanks for watching!"
