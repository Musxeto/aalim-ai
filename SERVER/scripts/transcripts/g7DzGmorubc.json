  "title": "Will I also be rewarded for giving charity on behalf of someone | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now the person giving charity on his behalf will he also be rewarded and this is a frequently asked question if I make an Umbra on behalf a deceased and the deceased will get the reward of my Umbra but as a living person performing the Rome rock will I get any reward the answer is no you intended the Umbra for that deceased person he will get the reward you intended to make Hajj on behalf of a deceased person he will be forgiven his sins as if the day his mother gave birth to him you on the other hand cannot share that great reward because hatch can be only done on one person's behalf yes you will be rewarded for the vicar you may for the Koran you recite for the prayers you offer but the reward which is designated for Hajj or Umrah the reward of a hundred dollars you gave in charity for the deceased will be accredited to his account and not to yours likewise and this is not our topic likewise if a person gives 100 euros for charity he'll be rewarded for 100 dollars if I say no I want this hundred dollars to be on for me and for my wife this means that I'll get 50 euros charity and she will get 50 euros salaka if I say I'd like to increase to include my parents then it would be 25 25 each and so on you cannot have 100 euros on your behalf and on her behalf and on your parents behalf and I hope this makes sense and answers your question"
