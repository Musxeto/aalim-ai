  "title": "Her sister thought it wasn't Zina, but now realises it was and is doubting her marriage",
  "transcript": "If the hadith is authentic, but the hadith to my knowledge is not authentic and Allah is for my sister that states me and my husband had zina and other haram actions but at the time of zina we stopped. I thought that full penetration did not happen so it was not zina but I considered everything else as zina and we repented for it before marriage and I said in my prayers that Allah forgive me for the sins we have committed. After repentance we still had haram communication and intimacy but did not commit zina and I did not repent for this but now I came to know even if slightest penetration occurs it is zina. So my previous repentance, does my previous repentance counts as repentance from zina and is my nikah valid because I did not know at that time that it is zina but later we still engaged in sinful acts that I used to think were zina and did not repent for them. Okay first of all seriously as Muslims we do not entertain or we should not entertain such questions on live TV. Yani people should have the etiquette, the decency to ask privately and alhamdulillah the scholars are all over the world and they answer your questions on the phone freely. You can go and visit them in the masjids. So I see that it is indecent to entertain such questions on live TV like this but this was a mistake probably may Allah forgive you and for your sister. The marriage is valid tell her to put a lid on it and not to keep on doubting unless she wants to be divorced. If she doesn't want her husband this is a different issue but she must not entertain such doubts and the marriage is valid and she should put a stop to all this nonsense."
