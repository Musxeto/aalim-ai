  "transcript": "yasmine says i wear proper hijab alhamdulillah a few of my friends don't wear the abaya and sometimes wear makeup as well is it permissible for me to go out with them to malls restaurants etc as mentioned a couple of questions ago about befriending a shia you must not befriend someone who's openly sinning so when you go out with other girls or women who are not abiding by the hijab and you're abiding by the hijab you're tarnishing the reputation of hijab by going out with them you're endorsing their sin by accompanying them and dealing with them normally and you're causing them to cause others fitness and you're collaborating with them by going out with them choose your friends wisely they're not the last people on earth to go to restaurants or to hang out in malls with don't go except with people who share your beliefs and who share what [Music] your convictions you"
