  "transcript": "Anwar from Kashmir. Okay, so this is question from one of my cousins. He says that his parents like don't respect him. So he says that they don't, his parents, especially his father, they don't, they don't treat him well. So he says that I do all the duties and I keep quiet in front of my parents. I don't yell back at them. I just keep quiet whenever they yell at me. So he says, but I have no love and no respect for my parents. So is this attitude okay in Islam? Barakallahu Fikum. And I hope my question reached. It reached, Alhamdulillah. And your question is commonly asked by people. Unfortunately, we as parents sometimes fail miserably in our mission and vision statement. In the sense that we encourage our children to be undutiful, disobedient, and disrespectful. How? By our own transgression and wrongdoing. By our own bad attitude and the way we deal with our own children. This is haram upon us. We have to fear Allah Azza wa Jal. Yes, we do have rights over our children, but they're human beings at the end of the day. And we can't ask them or burden them beyond what they can bear. So we have to be sensitive in how we treat them so that we do not lead them to hellfire because of our attitude towards them, which make them go against us and be disrespectful and undutiful. Now, having said that, if a person is tested by Allah by such abusive, disrespectful, bad parents, this is a test from Allah. He will be rewarded for being dutiful and respectful. They will be punished. Not because he's your son, it's okay to do whatever you want to do. No, you will be questioned and then you will be tormented and punished for what you had done to your son. So if the son is doing his level best and being respectful all the time, being dutiful all the time, and trying to be as obedient as possible, yet he has no love or respect in his heart. He can't. Simple as that. Is this sinful? The answer is no, providing they do not sense or feel any form of resentment or hatred or disrespect. Because sometimes your eyes can betray you. Your tone of voice can deceive you and let you down. If you succeed in not showing them any of such, inshaAllah there is no sin on you. May Allah make things easy for all of us."
