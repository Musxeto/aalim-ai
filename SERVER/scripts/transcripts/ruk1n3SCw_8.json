  "transcript": "and the final question is what is a woman also what if a woman also contributes financially in buying a home can she use the kaffir laws to get what is hers in the case of divorce this question is referring to the laws in america and canada and some in europe where the court gives the spouses half of what the other spouse possesses usually the man so if the man was earning and he has wealth and he divorces his wife or his wife asks for divorce and the court grants the divorce automatically they go to the wealth of the husband and say okay half of the house is hers half of your cars are hers stocks wealth amount you have in cash which is totally haram on islamic unfair inhumane and widely abused by women in the west but who cares it's a kafir system anyhow and this is what you get when you decide to live among the kafirs you live by their rules and you die by their rules so a woman says i was married to this muslim i had a job he had a job i contributed with him in building a house so he paid an x amount of money and i paid a huge x amount of money because this was our house and all of a sudden after 20 years of marriage the guy started dying his hair gray hair starting to drive driving convertibles starting to be hip and young again and all of a sudden he married a younger woman and i can't take that so i hide for divorce and after the divorce or throughout the divorce i demanded my right that i have contributed in the house which she knows it was not a gift that was our house and he denied me he says no the house is in my name and he's refusing to give me anything can i use the kafir law and go to court and demand half of his property to take what is mine the answer is yes providing that you only take what is lawfully yours and not a penny more so if you contributed with 150 000 dollars and the court grants you half a million which is half of what he possesses you only take 150 and return the rest back to him and allah knows best you"
