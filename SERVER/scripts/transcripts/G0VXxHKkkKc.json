  "title": "Grandma wanted to live with Mom, but Mom suggested Aunt's house due to Dad's hostility, mom sinful?",
  "transcript": "Alim from India yeah Alim Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Actually this question is from my mother. My maternal grandmother had expressed the desire to live in my mother's home but my mother suggested that she stayed with one of my aunts because my aunt would be able to take better care for her. Additionally when my maternal grandmother used to live with us many relatives would visit which would often make my father angry. Now my maternal grandmother has passed away. Did my mother do anything wrong in this situation? Jazakumullah Wa Jazakum. Usually children fight over the right to host their parents in their own home if they have the ability to do so. They literally fight because it's an honor and it is a crown on the child's head who wins this right. Now there are circumstances that we may not be able to judge and this is between a person and Allah. So if your mother had another sister or other sisters who were more qualified to provide comfort to their mother than her, for example your mom knows that your father is a bit aggressive, a bit rude, not a very hospitable person and that he would cause huge problems for your for your grandma and this is why your mother thought that it would be wiser to have her stay at her sister's house. There's no sin on her none whatsoever and Allah knows best. you"
