  "title": "Criticize OFFICIALS BACKBITING Gheeba",
  "transcript": "The first question is, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Can you please draw a clear line between people speaking badly of a person in his absence and criticizing a person who is in an official position or an organization leader? Is criticizing an organization leader or an official person, is it permissible to criticize them? In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah and his family and companions and those who follow his guidance. It was the Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, who identified what is gheeba. When he said, Gheeba is to mention your brother with something he hates. So when one of the companions objected and said, What about if my brother is as I have mentioned him? So I said, He is short and fat. And he is short and fat. I said, He is stingy and he's very stingy. The Prophet said, This is gheeba. This is backbiting. When you say what is accurately describing him, which he hates people to delegate among themselves in his absence. But if you accused him of something that is not in him, this is slandering. You have slandered him, which is a combination of gheeba and lying. Which is even worse. So it doesn't matter. Islamically, whether he's a government official or not. It's the same sin. Worldly, it matters because he's going to throw you in jail. He's going to take your money. He's going to expel you out of the country. He would do evil things. He's an official. Well, you crazy. So what is the benefit of it? There is no benefit except that it cools your heart a little bit when you vent. When you say, Oh, this ruler did this, did that. May Allah curse me. May Allah break him. Then what? Is there anything going to change? Nothing. Only thing that will change is the amount of hatred of you created in people's hearts towards him, which is not beneficial. Believing in the day of judgment, this man will suffer. Do you want me to swallow it? It's OK. OK. Because it's becoming too intimate. Anyhow, so this is not permissible. Now, ghaybah becomes permissible in necessities. Someone who is going to a scholar, quote unquote, who's not a scholar, who's deviant, who's a man of innovation, who has corrupt aqeedah. And the brother is naive. He doesn't know. So I have to go up and tell him, this guy is a deviant innovator. He has corrupt aqeedah. Don't go to him. The brother said, don't backbite. So, no, this is not backbiting. This is to clarify and to warn. Similarly, someone comes to me and says, brother, so-and-so has proposed to my sister. Do you think we should give him in marriage? Now, I have the option to say, if you trust me, don't give him in marriage. But I will not expose him because he does things in secrecy. I cannot expose him and tell you he's a junkie or he does drugs or he does this and that. In Sunnah, one of the female companions came to the Prophet and said to him, two men proposed to me, Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan and Abu Jahm. Which one should I choose? What did the Prophet say? As for Muawiyah, he's stone broke. He doesn't have money. As for Abu Jahm, he's a person who does not leave the stick from his shoulder, which means in Arabic either he beats women or he's a frequent traveler. The stick, he puts his clothes in his bags and he like a backpack and he travels a lot. So he wouldn't be a very good husband when he travels a lot. But I suggest that you marry Usam ibn Zaid. And she married him and she was very happy with him. So the Prophet exposed Ali as-Susam. Someone comes to ask you, I'm going into partnership. There's a joint venture between me and brother Abdullah. And he said, Oh, brother Abdullah deals in Riba. Brother Abdullah already cheated six brothers before you. He took their money and fled. And I said, Astaghfirullah, I will not backbite him. Oh, the brother will be the seventh. No, you have to expose, you have to say. So these things you have to be careful of. Sometimes it is not backbiting if it's a form of identification. So do you know Sheikh Asim? Which one? The one with the big nose? Oh, yeah, I know. He's a funny man. OK, I have to do something about it. This is a form of identification. Do you know Ahmed? Yeah, the short man. No, no, I'm talking about the tall guy. OK, I know him. You know Abdullah, the fat one. This is not to backbite. This is to identify. And this is found in all the books of Hadith. Al-A'sha, Al-A'raj, Al-A'ma and so on. They describe people in the Hadith of the Salah. When the man said, Oh, Prophet of Allah, is the prayer shortened into two or you forgot? And his name was nicknamed as Dhul-Yadain, the man with the two long arms. Because he had two long arms. So this Prophet said, What did Dhul-Yadain say? He described him of having two. The man did not say, Sheikh, you hurt me. You insulted me by calling me this name. No, this is a form of identification. And it's pretty normal, Inshallah. And I hope this answers your question."
