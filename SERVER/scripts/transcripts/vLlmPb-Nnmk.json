  "transcript": "at Adams times were there dinosaurs I wasn't there at the time I am old but not that old secondly we can't say yes or no without evidence from the Quran and Sunnah so we cannot confirm or deny because this is something we have no knowledge of now yes archaeologists can come and say either we're Tyrannosaurus dinosaurs or wherever names they just put from Latin and they claim that they looked like this and they this is their science but they can't prove that to us because they don't know when Adam was peace and blessing be upon him as most of them think that there was no Adam to begin with that we are all the the descendants of apes and we have evolved from apes to this which is nonsense so we can't take the word for it but at the same time we cannot deny or confirm that there were any such things as dinosaurs at that time"
