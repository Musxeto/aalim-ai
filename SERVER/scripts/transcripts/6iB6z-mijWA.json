  "transcript": "Ziyad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum So Sheikh, Fajr is from 12.30 to 5 past 10 I mean 5.10 every day but the time for Zuhr ends at 3.15 now in Bangladesh around that time and what I do is we used to pray in time 20 minutes but it doesn't suffice now so I skip some classes and pray Zuhr but the problem is I want to pray Sunnah and we have a prayer room in the compound so while I'm praying Sunnah some brothers come, say the Ikama and start praying the Fajr prayer and I heard after the Ikama is called no Nafal prayer is valid so what can I do? You have one question only you can pray it after the Zuhr prayer or after Asr prayer you can make it up Insha Allah if it clashes with your classes so you pray the Fardh on time and delay the Sunnah afterwards whenever you are capable of praying it Ameen"
