  "transcript": "in praying boja when then sunrise in known time what exact time do we have to pray Aloha I'm not good in shorthand but I think the first part of the question is about the time of boja prayer and when is it that it is prohibited to be prayed the time of doha prayer is when the Sun rises the height of the throw of a spear and this is timed by 10 to 15 minutes from the actual appearance of the ring of the Sun so once the ring of the Sun appears and after that by 10 or 15 minutes this is the time you can begin to pray Aloha or also pray salat will ashrak if you had prayed Fedya with the congregation and remained in the masjid remembering Allah reciting the Quran until the Sun had risen when does the time of doha prayer ends the time of doha prayer ends when the time of prohibition begins okay when does the time of prohibition begins the time of prohibition in the middle of the day begins about 10 minutes before the Adhan of Lahore and to make it clear this is an erected object the Sun rises from the east as the Sun rises from the east there is to this object a long shadow as the Sun rises the shadow is shorter and shorter and shorter until the Sun is entirely on top of this corrected object which means that it's in the middle of the the sky the sky then there is no shade this is the beginning of time of prohibition once the Sun goes a little bit to the west and we get a short shadow of the erected object to the east this is the time of a van in Arabic we call it the time of zewail meaning that the Sun is not in the middle of the of the heavens or the sky anymore it went to the direction of the west this shade is called Aziza well this is when the time of the begins so from the time when there was no shadow at all until the time of war this is a time of prohibition to pray and loja prayer is among the time of the prayers that we must not pray at that particular moment which is approximately between five to ten minutes just to be safe make it ten minutes before the advent of the horn so you do not pray then"
