  "transcript": "Carlos from Brazil Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So when we pray with a colored shirt or colored thawb, should we unfold the thawb to pray? When you pray with what? A thawb with a collar. For example, the pottery thawb with a folded part. What is folded? Your sleeves? No. The collar. The collar up your neck has nothing to do with your prayer. It has nothing to do with it. What has to do with a prayer? Your sleeves or your garment from below. If it's tucked in, this is what you have to release. If you do this for the Salat's sake, but if it is how you wear it throughout the day, then there's no reason for you to untuck it."
