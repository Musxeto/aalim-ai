  "title": "Private Tuition from NonMahram Permissible? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sayyid from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Actually Sheikh in this modern era most of the students prefer to get tuitions from the online source. From the what? So my question is that actually in my country India most teachers in online tuitions are non-mahram and also not Muslim and are not fully covered. So can I get classes from them? Okay so the issue is getting private tuition from a non-mahram, from the opposite gender and the answer is no. Alhamdulillah there are many many alternatives where you will find male to teach you rather than females. Maybe the females are more in number due to the fact that they have no jobs but there will always be male available and hence you must not opt for the opposite gender to teach you and you have to go for the same gender Allah knows best."
