  "title": "Should we pay Blood Money &  offer expiation for a Disbeliever? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Adah from Nigeria? Actually my question is a clarification on the accidental death. Yes sir. Is the ruling the same for Muslim and non-Muslim? Okay, with Adah's questions from Nigeria which is in response to an answer from the email which is, what about if the one who was killed by accident is a disbeliever? Should we pay the blood money and also give the Kafara? The answer is a Kafir or a disbeliever is either a Dhimmi or a Mu'ahad or a Musta'man or a Harbi. So the first three, they are all respected. Dhimmi is someone who lives in our country and pays the Jizya, the taxation, in order that we protect him and he can live safely among us. Mu'ahad is someone who has a treaty. We're not at war with them but he has a treaty and he comes in and out like all other non-Muslim countries who have a visa. They are Mu'ahad. A third person is Musta'man. He is from a place where we have war with but he's given a pass to come and like ambassadors, like envoys, etc. And the fourth category is those who do not have any of the previously mentioned and we are at war with them. They are our enemies. So if he is from the last category, there is no blood money needed for that because their money is not respected. So we cannot give them money, so it would be disrespected as well. But if he's from the above, so he's an expat who's a non-Muslim living on our lands and he is killed by accident, a road accident or whatever, he's Mu'ahad, he's Musta'man. In this case, he is like the Muslim. We have to give his heirs the blood money which happens to be half the blood money of a Muslim male which is 50 camels, heads of camels, instead of 100. And we have to give the expiation which is freeing a slave and if not possible, then we have to fast 60 consecutive days."
