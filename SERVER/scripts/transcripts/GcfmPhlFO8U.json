  "transcript": "chapter says shake when reciting the ISTE Haridwar after reciting has el Umbra do I have to mention the matter out loud in Arabic or English although I just think about the matter in my mind first of all chapter s Tahara should be recited in Arabic because this is thicker and thicker has to be in Arabic only those who are totally incapable of saying it in Arabic not even reading it in Arabic they can't they don't know arabic at all they can say it in English now the Doha has in the hadith had al amal so allahumma inni Esther here o Kabir amico a stock daruka be a quadratic as Elohim in public and other indicator Peru Allah of the Rotella more the Alamo in the current era level who you Elohim in Cana he coated he had an Armour how you relief edenia mahashiv our activity Umbria Julie Hill Julie factor Julio is certainly so it translates so o Allah after saying the full thing you come to the conclusion if in this matter there is goodness for me in this life in the hereafter and now and then this matter is referring to an issue that I am praying is the harder for let's assume it's a new job that I'm applying for so I don't say in Kenneth E has an honor I would say in kana fear Hannity if I'm buying a car in Cana fish Allah Allah say Allah if I'm marrying an a woman say in Cana physiology be cut away kata and I say her name so this is what you say and you don't say had an armor you just take this have a number and put the issue that you're praying is the Hara for now do I say it verbally or in my mind this is also another serious issue a lot of us when reciting the Quran they tend to recite it by visualizing and reading the letters without moving their tongues and lips likewise when you see people making dua raising their hands while their lips are sealed and also people who are praying when they're standing and praying they just say Allahu Akbar and that's it they close their lips and they decide the Fatih had the surah Allah ho Akbar and they say subhanAllah lean with their lips sealed scholars from all types of schools of thought I've searched this and I was devastated because this is how I used to recite the Quran and pray and do my dhikr thinking that this is sufficient but I looked into it and not a single scholar from the past nor the present from the contemporary Muftis to the old self scholars had ever said that this is valid they all insist and make it a condition that you have to move your lips and your tongue as if you're speaking but without making any sound and this is what they call silent now when you say it loud you verbalize it and you make a sound to it when uttering it so you have to say it's not mute I'm just saying it with my lips but without voice I don't think that the volume is beautiful so this is how it should be set in order for it to be accepted now imagine how many millions of Muslims hold the Quran and recite it without moving their lips thinking that this does the job and it doesn't I'd appreciate it if you look and we're able to find something from the Salif that supports reading without moving your lips and and and and tongue would suffice and would be valid"
