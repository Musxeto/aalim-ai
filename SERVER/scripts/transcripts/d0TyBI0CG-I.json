  "transcript": "our first email is from brother Hussein he says I wanted to know regarding male haircut Islam Q&A says that it has to be the same length etc which I believe is also a Salafi site said it can be different lengths which is more correct I like to keep small scissors cut on tip what's the smallest number I can have on the sides first of all Islam q and a dot info is one of the most trusted Islamic websites in the world and I have experienced this website for the past like 20 years maybe more since the mid 90s or late 90s and they work really hard and they ask scholars directly and take the fatwas from real scholars not like us Tom Dick or Harry so it is a trusted website and the fatwa czar also trust worthy however in so many cases the issue is with our understanding or in comparing Apple to Apple so it is not advisable for a layman to go and look for an answer to his question that may not fit the question that he is reading on that website people divorce their wives and all of a sudden they say I found a fatwa on this particular site and it says that the divorce is invalid or the divorce is valid not knowing that there is a little difference between your situation and the situation of the person who asked the question in the first place therefore one has to be careful in implementing and applying such fat words to them to their selves now the question that we have here at from Hussein of course we have the link or the title of Islam Q&A info which I highly recommend people to visit it on regular basis because it is a great source of information and to learn about Islam from such website so her saying says is there any specific number that I can use on my shaving machine so that I can cut the hair on the side of my head ahee what governs its issue are a number of things number one the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam where he curses the men who imitate women then the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam where he tells us that whoever imitates a people then he is from among them and finally the hadith of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam where he prohibited alc√°zar and what is al kasha is to shave part of the hair and to leave the other part so when looking at these three hadith combined it is not prohibited to have the hair on the top of the head longer a little bit than the hair on the sides this is the normal haircut anyone among the Muslims and the non-muslims the normal haircut would be that the hair on the side would be a little bit shorter what is prohibited if someone comes and he shortens it to the skin like the Marines when they have their hair cut they do it this way they have the top longer but it's almost shaven on the sides this is prohibited why because this is imitating the cough are the disbelievers plus it is aza if someone wants to make a mohawk haircut like mr. t for example also this is haram this is pasa clearly if someone wants to grow his hair long and has a ponytail in a way that is feminine he has no beard he has nothing but he just likes to have a long hair like the kuffar or the women this is also prohibited some football players may come and have weird haircuts so probably you'll find someone just shaving a line on the top of his head or on the side of his head well the other hair is normal but he just has a line here shaven of course this is haram this is Isaiah which the Prophet prohibited Ali insalata so unfortunately I was told that some Muslims may do such haircuts as a Muslim I have an identity and my identity does not require you to wear this otra which I'm wearing on my head it doesn't require you to wear a soap the white soap which is a long shirt that I'm wearing no no this is not part of the identity this is a cultural thing the identity is to be identified as a Muslim by not following the footsteps of the disbelievers so shaving your beard is totally prohibited in Islam this is part of your identity and it's mandated and obligatory to grow it having a normal hair cut is part of your identity because when once you do something that is not normal then you have changed your route into a different path which is not the straight path so normal haircut is okay but if you put these hadees that i had mentioned in mind and before you make a haircut you ask and consider in this case inshallah you will be safe"
