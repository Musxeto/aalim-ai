  "title": "Give to the Poor People or go to Hajj",
  "transcript": "sam from canada um so i heard that like in the subcontinent you know some people they uh like when they want to go to hajj um they like people say that you shouldn't go to hajj rather take the money for hajj and give it to the poor because there are poor needy people in your country right so if you're going to hajj and instead of giving the money to the poor which is i think some people say it's better but if you go to hajj like it's not accepted because you're not giving the money to the poor um is there any truth to that first of all so many people say so many things without backing it up from quran and sunnah on the contrary they go against the sunnah of the prophet sometimes against the clear instructions of the quran simply because they're following their whims and desires now what did the prophet instruct us he says continue to perform um um this is an instruction from the prophet allah though at his time there were lots of poor people never ever we've heard him all the companions all the tabereans saying that oops i've done five hajj that's enough let me help others never this had ever been said so those people who claim that it's best that we give money to the poor they are talking without knowledge and they would be sinful if they say that your hajj is un accepted when there are people while you are going for hajj and allah knows best you"
