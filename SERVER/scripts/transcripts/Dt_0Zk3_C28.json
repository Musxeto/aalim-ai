  "title": "Can we eat or drink on an Airline that serves Meat & Alcohol",
  "transcript": "Siddique from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, my question is, what's the ruling on eating meat and drinking water in an airplane of those airlines which serve non-halal food or alcohol on board? And my question is based upon a previous video that you said we can't eat or drink in a restaurant where pork or alcohol is served. Please explain. Barakallah. Wafikum Barakallah. If the airlines belong to a Christian, predominantly Christian country, like UK for example, or Europe, or the US, Canada, etc., then there is no problem, Inshallah. Or Ethiopian Airways, one of the highly rising airways in Africa, and I used them a couple of times, the service is good, and they're either Muslim or Christian, but predominantly they're a Christian country, so there's no problem in eating their food, Inshallah Azza Wa Jal. However, most, if not all, airlines, when reserving your ticket and buying it, if you ask for a Muslim meal, they will prepare a Muslim halal meal for yourself, and that would be a win-win, and Allah knows best."
