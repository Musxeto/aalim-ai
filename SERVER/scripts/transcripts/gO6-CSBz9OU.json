  "transcript": "sister says how do I deal with a husband who mentions the Lark almost every day well hey this is problematic yeah any Allah Azza WA JAL gave the power of divorce to the man and why is that because he is supposed to be the man but if a man abuses this god-given right then he is not a man anymore he is an imbecile ignorant child who has been given powers beyond his ability to handle not a real man is the one who threatens his wife by divorce if you don't bring me salt to add to my food I'm going to divorce you if you do not shut up if you utter one more word I'm going to divorce you if you go to see your parents I will divorce you if you demand money to buy food I'll divorce you what kind of a life is this this person is not a man definitely he has no relation to being righteous pious or a practicing Muslim nor he is a real man a man who was unable to deal with his wife to control his wife to be able to manage his house without using the word divorce the threat of divorce this is not a real man he's not a man simple as that now this is a different issue now our issue is with the sister she's saying how to deal with this such a person unfortunately there isn't any magical formula he is your test from Allah Azza WA JAL and this is a calamity and there are people who are tested through cancer or through Pham or through drought there are people who are threatened by bombs and barrels and chemical warfare as our brothers in Syria there are people who have had to migrate and maybe go to the Mediterranean and drown and die because of poverty so each person Allah tests and your test is with your husband what to do this is up to you you have to weigh the pros and cons is it a good investment to continue with maybe if I don't have children I wouldn't be considering him to live more because with the track record in a couple of years he threatened me to divorce me like 70 times what will happen in 3 or 4 or 10 years of time this case I have to look into it to have children then this is a game changer so I would highly recommend and advise you that you look into your pros and cons you to look at your choices and at the same time avoid anything that angers him avoid anything that provokes him to threaten you so this is your test from allah azza wajal i feel for you and if i were to see him or to talk to him i would definitely give him any sound advice but meanwhile may allah azza shall make it easy for you"
