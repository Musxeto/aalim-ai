  "transcript": "[Music] from germany is it not permissible for the muslim who have a weak iman and we acknowledge to give dawah to the non-muslim because there is a risk that they may be deceived by them okay i will answer inshallah sidi for germany he says some say that it is not permissible for someone who is ignorant and has little eman to make da'wah because he may make errors and he may be negatively affected when they answer back and this is not a one size that fits all it depends on the person it depends on what you're giving dawah so if i am with knitting knowledge and weak iman i don't have to have any strong knowledge or strong iman when i call people to islam about the oneness of allah about the truth of the quran these are common things that do not require much knowledge therefore you can make dawah you can call people to islam in the things that you're confident in being able to show to the people and you have strong conviction and belief in and allah knows best you"
