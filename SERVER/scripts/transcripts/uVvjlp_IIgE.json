  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from Kenya Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Yes, I know a brother who owns a halal restaurant. Is he allowed to do business with non-Muslims during daytime Ramadan? Jazak Allahu Khairan Wa Jazak. The majority of scholars say that the disbelievers, the kafir, are addressed by the major concepts of sharia, which is to accept Islam, to believe in the oneness of Allah, to believe in the message of the Prophet ﷺ, as well as they're addressed by the minor aspects of sharia, such as to pray, to fast, to clip their fingernails, to wear the hijab for women, to grow the beard for men. Now, just because they're kafir, it doesn't mean that everything else they're exempted from. In Surah Al-Muddathir, Allah Azza Wa Jal says that the believers in paradise look at the people in hell, and they ask them, why were you admitted to hellfire? These disbelievers say, قَالُوا لَمْ نَكُوا مِنَ الْمُصَلِّينَ وَلَمْ نَكُوا نُطْعِيمُوا الْمِسْكِينَ The first two things they say, the reason we were admitted to hellfire, that because we were not offering prayers. Okay, you're disbelievers, you go to churches and synagogues, what prayers are we talking about? You're not supposed to pray like us Muslims five times a day? No, they are. They are addressed by an order to believe in Allah and in the shahadah, la ilaha illallah, and also to practice every single thing in Islam, or they will be punished on the day of judgment. قَالُوا لَمْ نَكُوا مِنَ الْمُصَلِّينَ We were not among the worshippers who used to pray, and we did not used to feed the needy and the poor. This is why the scholars say that it is not permissible to serve disbelievers food during the daytime of Ramadan, because they're ordered to fast. Okay sheikh, if they fast, would their fast be valid? Of course not, they're disbelievers. Nevertheless, we as Muslims are not allowed to collaborate with them in such fashion, and this is the opinion of a great deal of scholars and schools of thought, which I'm inclined to follow. Therefore, if your restaurant works during the daytime of Ramadan, and it cooks food, and people buy the food and go and eat, it is not permissible for you to do this. But if you are in a Muslim country, and you cook food during the daytime or asr time of Ramadan, where people would buy food and take it home to break their fast after sunset on it, this is permissible, and I hope this answers your question."
