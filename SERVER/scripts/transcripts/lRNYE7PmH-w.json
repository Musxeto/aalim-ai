  "transcript": "can a person give the Quran to a non-muslim can a Muslim give a Quran to a non-muslim many of the Muslims consider that being in woodo is compulsory before touching the Quran that the reason they say you can't give the Quran to the non-muslim I already told you earlier it's not a f and furthermore some Muslims okay fine if you want to give the Quran don't give the Arabic version only give the translation give only English or French or German I said fine someone wants to do that I've got no problem but I prefer giving the translation along with Arabic text because if the translator who a human being has made a mistake you can go back to the original text the person should not misunderstand that Allah has made a mistake I prefer Arabic along with the translation and if Allah subhana wa taala holds me responsible for giving the Arabic Quran to a non-muslim I will be in the good company I'll be in the company of the Prophet because I beloved prophet wasallam he dictated letters to non-muslim Kings he dictated letters to the nigas of ABIA to Emperor hercus emperor of Persia king of Yemen king of Egypt he dictated letters in which he even dictated the verse of the Quran of Iman 3 verse number 64 which says say people of the book come to come in terms as us and you which is the first term that we worship n but Allah that we associate to partner with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and PR other than Allah if then they turn backness we Muslim that we are Muslims bowing will to Allah subhana tala so this verse of the Quran was dictated by Prophet Muhammad s Ali wasallam when he sent letters to the non-muslim Kings some of them after reading the letter they accepted Islam some of them to the letter some of them even trampled it beneath the feet so the prophet could give vers of the Quran the non Muslim why can't we and furthermore I would like to ask a question that today there are 14 million Arabs who are Coptic Christians which translation of the Quran will you give to these Arab Christians will you translate the Quran into Arabic so the best is the word of Allah subhana tala so I feel there's no problem in fact you should give the Quran along with the translation of the non-muslims thank you doctor"
