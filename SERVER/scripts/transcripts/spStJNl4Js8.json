  "transcript": "um the next question is how can I achieve kushu in my prayers no this requires a long long long session is not steroids it's not a pill you take alhamdulillah now is a lifestyle is a conviction I always tell this to people who come to me if You' heard it a gazillion times it's boring but who cares people come my wife doesn't wear the hijab she my son smokes she my husband is addicted to porn she this she that I say to them all of these are symptoms if someone comes to you and says I have a severe headache I think here you you give them Tylenol so in in in Saudi we have Panadol so give them two tinal Mah 6 hours no headache he comes back oh it came back again take two time and you do this for a whole week did I help him no probably he has cancer he has something that is serious yeah yeah yeah he has a serious illness chronic illness the symptoms are the headache so by giving him what cures the symptoms not the illness itself I'm not helping him likewise all of our problems are going back to the chronic illness that is not knowing Allah we have a huge void in our hearts it's empty that's why we feel depressed so many times that's why so many times we're agitated we're not happy you can see it in the people's faces they working 9: to 5 and they take 2 hours to commute and 2 hours to come back and they have to pay the rent and they have to well here the rent is I compared to Toronto anyhow um and they have problems with the kids they have problem with the wife the in-laws the food the debts the so many things this is the void in your heart I went to Pakistan last year and Subhan Allah in Pakistan the people are Stone broke below poverty lines and seriously but I see people with 13 or 14 family members living in Shanty houses or 10 houses no running water alaykum please come and the smile is from here to here and he doesn't say I'm your biggest fan because he doesn't even have a fan and the guy invites me to abriani said we we we received this three nights ago from a leftover from the wedding come it's it's I said this is not sufficient for me alone it's it's only couple of spoons let alone your family said no no no no say Allah Allah has graced us where can I get this IM his heart is filled with the love of Allah he doesn't look at the half empty of the glass or The Empty Glass because he has a glass we have bottles and still we think that Allah has not favored us or blessed us does not come until you know who Allah is until you know who what's his beautiful names and attributes isn't it a shame that when someone says Allah has 99 names and you asked how many names do you memorize he said like 15 and then someone asks you about of these 15 names how many do you the the meaning of maybe one or two then how would you say allahar and start to pray it's empty you don't know who you're talking to when you say subh you don't know who you are bowing to or prostrating to therefore to do we need much more time and space and an an open heart to rectify our Affairs our whole lifestyle is rubbish or as they say in England rubish it is nonsense we're not abiding by the Quran or by the Sunnah we do good deeds I have to admit mashallah the brothers pay generously for the cause of Allah the brothers may offer night prayer the sisters may cook food for Ramadan they're contributing to the community but we always think that we have credit what what do you mean she you're making a call yeah I have credit it's an international callam doesn't answer the mobile WhatsApp or FaceTime only international call you can call me any time of the day or night my number is open to all it's free but I don't receive except one call a day and it has to be less than 3 minutes and quick rapid fire question not she I'd like to tell you about my problem since childhood I'm going to hang up so you call and you get the answer what did I what brought me to this issue huh yeah I I totally [Music] losted AG age and 13 daughters and the uters I forgot anyhow to get you have to fill the void in your heart you have to learn Allah's beautiful names and attributes you have to change yes when you give I have credit ah see you're asleep have asleep not more than me what do we mean by we have credit we all are like this I'm among you I go take omra so I finish my om I live 1 hour away from Kaa alhamdulillah so taking om is piece of cake while driving back Shan comes to me said why don't you listen to some music I just did said yes you have a clean book you have credit hm okay so I listen to some music go back home why did you want watch Netflix I don't have it subscribe Game of Thrones season 16 good okay I have credit this is our our biggest problem we treat Allah that we have credit I've done good things in my life I've done charity I've done night prayer I've fasted Monday so I have credit and this is the void in our hearts we don't have fear of Allah we think that no I've done so many things Allah should give me more so once you feel the void in Your Heart by knowing Allah by being humble then inshallah you have Allah Knows Best by"
