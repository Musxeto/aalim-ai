  "title": "Can I get a Pro Version of an App where multiple users have access to it through a 3rd party? assim",
  "transcript": "There is a designing app named Canva. Its proversion is like one dollar per month I guess, so twelve dollar per year. But there is a page selling the proversion at only one dollar for two years. I asked them how is it halal or how does this work. They said they buy the administration and then sell it to us. It's like they give access of their account to multiple people and take money for that. So is this halal? Can I buy it and design? If you buy such a or an access to an app through a third party and you use your own name and password, this is permissible. But if you buy access to that app through a third party and you have to use their username and password, this is not permissible."
