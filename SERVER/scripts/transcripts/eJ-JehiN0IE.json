  "title": "Scared to have more children as I have 3 already, Family Planning",
  "transcript": "Question about family planning. Here living in UK, I'm kind of scared to have more children. I have three already. And because of the fitna that they get in the school and everything, and as a rebirth, I don't really have much choices. I don't know. Is it family planning okay if you are scared for the fitna for children? Okay. Like, interception, all that stuff. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. JazakAllah. JazakAllah. As for family planning, having three children is a gift from Allah Azza Wa Jal. And to worry whether to have more would be problematic, you're scared for the fate of the coming children, this is from shaytan. When you have three children, the risk is there. When you have one child, the risk is there. When you have more than three children, the risk is less. How is that? Because they'll be together. The more children you have, the more care they would give one another, the more experience they would share with one another, and the lesser threat would be upon them as a group, as a unity, as a number of siblings together. So the Prophet encouraged us, alayhi salatu wa salam, to have as many children as possible. Not that we focus on quantity over quality, rather they go in parallel. So have a lot of children, but at the same time invest in upbringing them in a fashion that would be fitting of Islam and the Muslims, and that would comfort you when you're older, bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, when you have so many children who would take care of you at an older age, bi-idhnillah. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
