  "transcript": "and finally abdul wahab from holland what's the ruling on reciting different verse in the prayer now this has to be done by an expert and if he instructs the people and tells the people and they know him so he's not just a random person coming to pray rather he is a well-known imam and he says listen guys today mahdi prayer i'm going to recite with worship and i'm i'm going to do it in the in the prayer okay okay bismillah no problem because the seventh is from allah and all the seven we have today are accepted by all scholars of islam so if you do this there's no problem now the question is can he recite in the first rakah hafsan asam and then in the second raka warsan afer and then he starts mixing up or in the first raka he mixes up three or four kirat in the first rakah this is an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that if he's doing it alone to himself and he's knowledgeable this is permissible but if he's leading the prayer this is not permissible why it's all from allah correct but the problem is that we always look at the pros and cons we weigh the consequences if the benefits outweigh the disadvantages and and the shortcomings we go ahead with it in this case it would cause a lot of confusion especially among the worshipers they don't know if this is a mistake or not and what is he doing reading in this quran and then switching to another to the third quran this guy doesn't know what he's doing so it is best not to do this when you lead the prayer in the same salat especially if they are interlinked the ayat because the meaning may differ but if you recite in one quran throughout the whole salat after giving them a head up heads up notice i hope inshaallah that this is permissible and allah azza knows best"
