  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa'laykumussalam Who's this? Muhammad Rasul from UK Hayyakallah, I don't have your name here but let's go I have a question, I think it's for all the Muslims around Europe We have kids basically here in UK and the kids are going to school, basically they teach them about genders and we have no choice and the best way basically is to leave Europe and where we go, we're from Iraq and which is not safe and we are basically in a bad position and we don't know what to do because if we go with the bear and the wives go with the niqab, we might be asked every week, you know, we have to go to police, you know where we go is not safe basically, you know, it's Sunni but it's run by the, you know what I mean Okay, Akhi, this is a problem that most Muslims living in kafir lands face but to my knowledge the UK is the best place for Muslims to live in because their people and their government are very tolerant and open-minded unlike neighbouring countries who are hypocritical and blatant liars when they say that there is democracy in their land, rather there is communism and the likes and socialism enforcing their people not to wear, the girls in school not to wear the not the headscarf, the abaya, anything that relates them to their religion is totally banned. UK is the best to my knowledge, so alhamdulillah if you are unable to prevent your kids from studying in such public schools there are private schools, Muslim schools that do not teach this if you're totally unable and you don't have the means to migrate to a Muslim country, in this case you have to focus on condensing the amount of Islamic knowledge you give to your children to teach them that this gender issue and the LGBTQ and the sex education is all against Islam and teaching the proper knowledge about Islam, teach them how to abide by the Quran and the Sunnah and to have their own identity and inshallah they will be saved."
