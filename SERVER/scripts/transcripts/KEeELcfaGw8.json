  "transcript": "for us from the uk unfortunately my wife uh and i have been separated since uh ramadan last ramadan and now my wife would like to pursue the divorce but she's insisting that i sell the house and give her half of the money from that i just want to know islamically what is the best thing to do and the house is in whose name it is in my name i i paid for it completely okay i will answer your question inshallah uh for us from the uk is asking about a woman who wants to pursue filing for divorce but she insists on following the kafir laws of the country and if she's a christian or a jew we don't have anything to say this is her religion that she is following and there is nothing worse than kuffer but if she is a muslim and she knows the severity of the punishment of following other than allah's law then we have a problem unfortunately a lot of the laws in kafir countries non-muslim countries such as the u.s europe canada etc they give the right for half of the property of the man to his ex-wife and this is totally prohibited in islam something that i have worked hard to collect my heart earned money and i buy or build a house who gives the right for my wife who is unable to remain as a loyal and obedient wife who just wants to go for divorce especially when this is lucrative business for such a woman who does not believe in allah and does not believe in sharia and refuses to make quran and sunnah arbitrate between her and her husband in the dis in such a dispute we can't do anything and this is why some scholars went to the extent that whoever legislates or goes in arbitration to non-muslim laws because he knows that the islamic law or the sharia law is not in his favor they say that this person is an apostate he has left the fold of islam so unfortunately there are a lot of such people who claim to be muslims and they want a quick gain in this life what happens after 10 20 years when they die and they're six feet under or on the day of judgment they could care less if they believe of the existence of such punishment but if they don't you you have no other alternative for us but to obey the law of the country give her a warning a reminder and tell her that you will not forgive her on the day of judgment and i guarantee you with the grace of allah that every penny she takes unlawfully will burn in her grave when she dies in addition to what awaits her in hellfire because consuming the rights of others unlawfully is one of the major sins in islam you have to clear your slate before you meet your maker the almighty as a virgin you"
