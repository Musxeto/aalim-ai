  "title": "Should my sister travel to Jordan without a mahram to live closer to my mother? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh yusuf from canada my wounded mother lives in jordan near her own mother and my 32 year old unmarried sister lives with me here in canada so my sister apparently has a job in canada but the question is should she move to jordan to live with my mother and let go of her job um to take care of her like under the banner of you know the game we've gone through this youtube couple of times before in the emails and in a previous question say stating that traveling without a mahram to work in saudi arabia to be close to your mom is not permissible because this is sinful by its own now your question progressed into okay should she quit her job and relocate in jordan with my mom to serve her that's it yes if she's financially capable and most likely you can't provide for both of them and she doesn't have to work then yes it is an obligation for either one of you to be with your mom to take care of her but if you said to me but my mom is independent she's like 50 years old she's young she's strong she's fit she's financially capable of taking care of herself in this case it is not mandatory but it is usually logical for the children to accompany their parents at such an age and be with them to serve them and to take care of them and elijah knows best you"
