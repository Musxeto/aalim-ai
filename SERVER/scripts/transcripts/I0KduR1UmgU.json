  "transcript": "Adil from Spain so I'm basically a programmer that makes programs on computers and basically there was a another person's code that I downloaded that I have to work with to make a mathematical education videos and in one of the code lines the names of the function is show Creations um and so I was working with that does that mean I committed sh or is it no no no there is no sh in such names the name of creation Creator uh and the likes there is no sh in that because Allah in the Quran called others as creators and said to create creation so there is no similarity between between Allah the Creator and humans and others who create also things I create a beautiful drawing I create a poem this is not shik at all so don't worry about this"
