  "title": "OCD with Istinja & Purity, it takes her 20-30 mins to purify herself❗️",
  "transcript": "leila from pakistan she says her sister has a problem with istinja so when she answers the call of nature it takes her between 20 to 30 minutes to purify herself and most ocd people have this and i always tell those who come to me in counseling that shaytaan works in two ways either a person is far away from islam doesn't care about prayer doesn't care about nabak or najas or purities maybe he doesn't pray at all doesn't care about halal haram food this person shaytan focuses on forcing him to pursue his desires to pursue his sins and lusts this is all what he cares about and this is the vast majority of muslims unfortunately the second type of muslims are those who are inclined to loving the quran loving the prophet they love allah they are so keen on prayers they are so meticulous on having this area washed or not they are very careful when it comes to halal and haram food these people shaytan focuses on extremism on exaggeration so it comes to a small grain of sand and inflates it in their heads until it's as big as the himalayan mountains and this would make their life miserable and he keeps on pushing and pushing until they snap and leave the fold of islam we're going to hell both ways so what the heck so they leave islam all together your sister is one of those how to advise this is there's a process it has to be done through communication through speaking to her through listening to her but usually ask her now are you righteous are you practicing justice yes i'm trying my level best to please allah azza okay are you more righteous in practicing than the prophet allah or his companions or the tabiani she says no had any one of them ever suffered like you she said no are you more righteous in practicing than the 2 billion muslims living on earth today not probably no so what is happening to you it's shaitaan so there is a process where you give and take and you start to explain to people because in counseling sessions we are not psychiatrists we don't talk about spending time and okay we have six sessions talk to me about your childhood okay half an hour is gone next session talk to me were you abused when you were young and you just listen and write no islamic counseling sessions is about opening your eyes a couple who fail to see what where the problem is and they fight and nag and they end up in divorce when they have counseling sessions we open their eyes and make them see what's good and what's bad and make them see their own faults and shortcomings they realize everything is fixed alhamdulillah with the grace of allah ocd people now you don't see it it doesn't exist why do you spend so much time who's in the corner of the toilet laughing his head off who are you pleasing shaytan they all know this but they don't find someone to ask them the proper questions and open their eyes so inshallah if you tell her this it would make a difference"
