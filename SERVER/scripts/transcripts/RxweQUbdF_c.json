  "transcript": "tan from Bangladesh I had two questions my first question is my mom tells me to wake her up at further time for that I need to go to my parents' bedroom without knocking the door as I know that they are asleep and my knocking won't be sufficient to wake them up but recently I have known that one should knock the door before entering people's rooms at further time from the Quran and uh now what should I do to wake my mom up and I would like to inform you that my father is usually annoyed by my calling so I need to sneakily wake my mom up no you cannot you cannot enter their room without seeking permission first and if they're sound asleep and your mom will not wake up for fer Without You entering and opening the door don't wake her up simply a simple is that you cannot go in and maybe find them both naked how would you feel so even if they give you their word that they won't be you cannot trust this Allah said you should not go to their Chambers until you seek their permission if they don't give it to you meaning they're awake and aware of what's Happening then don't enter it and your mom's responsible for waking herself up"
