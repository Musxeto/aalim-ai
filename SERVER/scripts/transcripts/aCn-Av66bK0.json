  "transcript": "samia from the us um i know that it is not permissible for a woman to take selfies of herself but um if a woman never knew in the past that it was not allowed and like she has old photos of herself can she like print those photos off of her phone and like put it in an album so it's like not on a device and it can't be hacked or like seen by anyone the answer is no it's even worse when you print it a selfie on your device the worst thing you could do is you crack the whole device and throw it in the dustbin nobody can retrieve it you can format it people can hack into it and retrieve the pictures but when you print it and put it in an album this can be seen by others who may come into your home after your death etc and all of this defies the purpose of hijab so if you did not know the ruling allah forgives your sins now you know the ruling delete all of your pictures tear down all of your hard copies when i got married 40 almost 38 years ago at the time we didn't know the ruling my wife and i took pictures together the following day she as a wise woman came to me and she said that i've heard that it is not permissible to keep pictures in the house i said yes this is one of the scholars rulings at the time i was a beginner so i i said yeah but there are other schools that say it's okay she said is it best for our religion not to keep it i said of course especially for you in your wedding dress this is totally prohibited immediately she brought the scissors and cut tons of pictures went to her mom's place cut the pictures of hers with her mom against her mom's will this is what a true believer should do and may allah make us steadfast on the path that pleases him until we die without changing colors you"
