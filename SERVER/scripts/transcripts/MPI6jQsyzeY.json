  "title": "Is Co Education Allowed in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaykum I'm hasb from Afghanistan can women study with men in same place I mean coeducation as far as women studying in the same University or same College as long as the hijab is mentioned there's no problem but if you are saying co-education means they are studying in the same class and sitting next to each other this is not correct in Islam because in Islam there is hijab so the best thing for education is that if they are very young maybe in the nursery or Junior kg or senior kg or first standard or second standard till the woman and boy becomes the adult if below the age of eight if they sit in the same class there is no objection but I personally prefer that the segregation is much earlier maybe Nursery no problem Jun no problem but once they reach first standard second standard they should be segregated but islamically till they become matur till they reach puberty below the age of nine there is no problem they can intermingle it's permitted but I prefer at early age but regarding adults whether in in the secondary school or whether in colleges can men and women be present in the same class and can they be educated it is not permitted in the Sharia for the intermingling of the male and female and now this I've given the talk I even handled the question on session that when there was a survey done in UK that which get better results the co schools or single sex schools the survey said that the results of the Single Sex schools were far superior than schools which had girls and boys together and the reason was that many of times the students were trying to impress the opposite sex than to pay attention on the studies the girl will try to you know impress the boys in the class the boys will start and try and impress the girls in the class so the concentration level normally is less in a CO school as compared to a single sex school and islamically also the hijab is there Islam doesn't agree in intermingling if you have intermingling of sexcess in co-education besides the level of Education coming down even Islam doesn't permit it because there is segregation and the hijab is there and it should be maintained besides the dress even intermingling should be prevented and Islam doesn't permit it hope the answer the question"
