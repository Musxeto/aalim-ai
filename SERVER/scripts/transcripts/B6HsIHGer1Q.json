  "title": "Did Sheikh Ibn Baz say the earth is flat and anyone who says otherwise is an Atheist",
  "transcript": "Sadiqa from Bangladesh? [Questioner: I have a question, I read an\narticle in a website, in that website the Sheikh bin Baz (may Allah have mercy on his\nsoul) said that the earth is flat, and whoever claimed that it is wrong, is an atheist and\ndeserve a punishment, is this true? what kind of Aqeedah we need to have in this case?]\n[Sheikh: I will answer you in Sha Allah.] Sadiqa says, some quote that Sheikh Ibn Baz\nsaid that the earth is flat and whoever says otherwise he's an Atheist. This is not entirely true. This was said in the beginning and the Sheikh\nsays, 'I haven't seen it. I only judge by what I read in the Qur'an. And to him, all what Allah mentions in the\nQur'an is that 'Whatever you see, you see it flat in front of you', not that it is not\nround. So, anyone who says otherwise he's an atheist? No, I don't think the Sheikh said anything\nsimilar to that. Nevertheless, he's not infallible. He's a great Imam of Islam and the Muslims,\none of the greatest contemporary scholars of our times. And he's not infallible, everybody makes mistakes. Even the companions, may Allah be pleased\nwith them, used to make mistakes. Only the Prophet (aleyhi salatu wa salam)\nwho does not make mistakes. So if you can count the mistakes of the individual,\nthis is a plus sign. Because if you say 'Oh, Sheikh [inaudible],\nhe has one, two, three mistakes that I've counted throughout the years of his teaching'. Wow, that's a track record. He should get a medal, not Olympic, but a\nmedal for that. But if a person has like a gazillion mistakes\nand every single time he speaks and opens his mouth you can count 6 or 7 mistakes, this\nis a different issue. And Allah knows best."
