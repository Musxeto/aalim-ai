  "title": "Sujood as Sahu if we make a mistake in dua of Tashhaud or recitation of Quran",
  "transcript": "The next question is, do we need to do forgetful prostration if we make any mistake in reciting any dua during the shahwat? Some scholars say sujood al sahwi or the forgetfulness prostration can be done for any mistake you do, even in sunnah. So even if you forgot to raise your hands, yalla. But this is not true. The most authentic opinion is that forgetfulness prostration can be offered if you make a mistake in pillars or in mandatory acts. Sunnah acts, no, you don't offer them. Mistakes in recitation of the Quran is as well not part of the things you make a sujood al sahwi for, and Allah knows best."
