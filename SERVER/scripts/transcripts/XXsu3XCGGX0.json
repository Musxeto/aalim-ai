  "transcript": "consider subscribing we have a suede from the uk you're doing well um my question is uh does allah subhanahu wa ta'ala or can allah misguide his servant and i would like to know the the statement a woman does the translation the meaning of it does it wherever allah leave him astray you cannot get anyone to guide him or whoever allah misguide him you cannot find anyone to guide them okay um from the uk is it true that allah lets astray whomever he wishes that says of course this is totally true and it says in black and white in the quran it's mentioned in the sunnah in numerous places whomever allah guides is the guided one um and whoever allah misguides no one will guide or be an ally to so this is part of allah being the lord of this universe everything in this universe belongs to who allah who's the creator allah who provides for every creature and living being in this universe allah who facilitates the affairs allah who gives life and death allah so who dares question allah azzawajal for what he does yes but how is it possible that allah misguides people does allah own us yes if he throws us in hell can anybody complain or object no if i take a hundred dollar bill and burn it can anybody say well stop don't do that no it's mine so allah has the highest example but you don't mix apples with oranges before you jump to conclusions ask yourself the following questions does allah own everything in this universe the answer is yes is allah knowledgeable the answer is yes is allah wise the answer is yes is allah fair and just and never transgresses against anyone the answer is definitely yes if you have this given and if you have your conviction set on this then you know that when allah sets someone astray that allah did not do anything wrong or unfair or unjust because allah is acting within his dominion and allah azzawajal is acting within his wisdom and knowledge and fairness and justice so this is your mistake and this is your own wrongdoing if you want to be guided this is the way welcome our hands are open you're the one who doesn't want to so who are you to blame allah mentioned in surat ibrahim chapter 14 verse number 22 that satan when the people of hell come and complain start blaming him it's because of you that we are in hell fire for eternity he stands up and give a narration gives a speech allah he says it's in the quran check it out 14 22 allah promised you and fulfilled his promise i promised you and betrayed you i had no power over you except to call you and you responded and answered so don't blame me rather blame yourselves i'm not going to benefit you and you're not going to benefit me this is what's what will happen so it's your own shortcoming and mistake you"
