  "transcript": "leila from pakistan um my question is about purity after meditation in which i'm getting confused that it is known that there are variations in each woman's cycle for example if a woman bleeds for 5 days and then she gets from discharge for next three days and on the ninth day she's his purity like white discharge but also she sees religious prone discharge with white discharge that's why discharge is a sign of priority so should she pray or skip it or and what should she do otherwise how long how long is this going on sorry how long is this and her period was what six days the government bleeds for five days and for next three days she uh gets prone to charge okay on the eighth day she sees the sign of purity on the ninth day she sees a sign of purity associated with brown discharge yes no this is not her sign of purity she has to see the white milky thread-like discharge pure without any brownish or yellowish discharge and this is what mother aisha used to advise the women at her time she used to say do not hasten until you see it clear and pure and allah knows best you"
