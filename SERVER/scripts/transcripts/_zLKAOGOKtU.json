  "title": "He traveled to another country where they started fasting later; should he fast 31 days?",
  "transcript": "Ida says I'm going to travel to a country which started fasting later than my country do I need to fast on the 30th day of Ramadan in that country assuming the country that I travel have 30 days of Ramadan and my total days of fasting would be 31 days or can I break my fast on that day either what counts is the country you're in so Ramadan is on a Saturday the beginning of Ramadan but actually in Saudi it was on a Monday I am in India on Sunday I travel I reached on the evening to Saudi Arabia they say tomorrow is Ramadan so I begin to fast with them why don't I postpone fasting till Tuesday because India which I originated and came from started fasting on Tuesday because the Prophet said Ali his salat WA Salam the day of fasting is the day when you fast and the day you break your fasting that is afraid is the day you break your fast what does that mean it depends on the country you're in you follow the community not the country you came from so by this if I begin to fast on a Monday which is the first of Ramadan in Saudi Arabia and I fast 27 28 days and before Ramadan ends in Saudi Arabia it's silver mobile I traveled to India who started too fast on a Tuesday so they are fasting today and tomorrow and the day after but I will be fasting more than Saudi which I started too fast with no problem because on that particular day that I went to India are the Muslims fasting in India yes it's Ramadan then I have to fast with them but sure I completed 30 days and in Saudi they fasted only 29 days completed today's share they are fasting 31 days for me where it is only 30 days for them you have to fast 31 days but Ramadan for you is only 30 so why do I fastest extra day because this extra day would count as voluntary but it is part of your Ramadan meaning that if you skip fasting the last 30th day in India though you fasted your own 30 days you would have skipped a day of Ramadan but I fasted 30 days yes but ask the people is today Ramadan day was it yes then you have skipped a day of Ramadan and you have to make that up"
