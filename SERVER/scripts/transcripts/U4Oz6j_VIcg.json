  "title": "After praying the Fard are WOMEN also obliged to  change the position or spot to pray Sunnah",
  "transcript": "latifah from the u.s is the instruction to change the prayers position after the fart to women the same as it is to men what do you mean there is a hadith where the prophet this was narrated by a number of companions such as where he said that the prophet assad prohibited us to pray before changing the position or speaking and there are hadiths about jumaa friday prayers and about general prayers and also the prophet said assalam said to his companions couldn't one of you just move a little bit forward a little bit backwards or to the right or to the left which means that it's an easy thing but you guys are lazy why aren't you doing it so this is an instruction from the prophet not to connect your sunnah voluntary prayers with your father prayer so if you concluded the fardo you must not pray anything in the same spot unless you speak to someone giving salam asking about the time or change the position the spot you were you pray then a little bit forward or backwards or to the right or to the left so latifa is saying is this the same for women if they're praying home after their prayer the answer is yes"
