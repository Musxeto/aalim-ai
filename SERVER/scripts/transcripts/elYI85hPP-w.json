  "title": "My dad verbally/emotionally abuses my mom, what should I do? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Oh says that his father is abusive and he fights a lot with his mother and whenever they fight his father curses his wife his children everybody so he curses Osama and his siblings so he wants to know how to deal with such a a person in such abuse because whenever he wants to interfere people tell them don't interfere well this is true interference between your father and mother is very problematic as they say damned if you do damned if you don't because if you take sides the other parent would hate you for that and make dua against you so it's your mother's problem as long it's normal fights mental abuse cursing words nothing physical this seems that your mother is responsible for that she can file for divorce for Haller she can get people to interfere from his family and her family she can put an end to it and most likely most of the times she's involved in causing such problems because such abuse is a cocktail between the personality of the abuser the father and the conditions that your mother is setting to it for him so she's calling for it she knows how to avoid it but she doesn't and this lack of communication is the mother of all trouble between and conflicts between spouses not only that also the lack of respect which is obvious and clear to anyone who's looking that they both lack they don't respect one another so what to do I believe that the best form of action is to stay away and to individually when they are in a good mood give a word or two of advice so you don't advise your father in front of your mom you don't advise your father when your father is upset or angry you try to choose the time and the place secondly you must not respond to any such abuse when people abuse you they want to upset you to anger you to provoke provoke a negative response from you and to hear something bad if you remain silent you do not defend yourself you do not argue you do not reply back after a while they will feel silly and they will stop or at least reduce finally and thirdly that this is your test from Allah would you like to be tested with cancer you personally Osama no would you like to be tested as those brothers and sisters of ours in the rural India and many more who are being raped killed slaughtered or in even in India would you like to be tested like our Muslim brothers they're being oppressed answers No would you like to be in Syria with barrels of bombs coming and burning all you have children all your siblings or your your family you cannot do anything about it No and so on so this is your test from Allah be patient and diplomatic and inshallah allah will find a way for you"
