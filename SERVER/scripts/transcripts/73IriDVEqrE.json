  "transcript": "a brother Yousef I think is asking about the to advance of Federer and why do we have to advance well this is how it was at the time of the Prophet Isis Salam all the years that that the Prophet a son lived in Medina they had to advance the first Adan was done by Bilal the Methvin of the Prophet s of Salaam and the Prophet said to the people when Bilal gives the Adan this should not stop you from eating and drinking this is just a reminder so that those who are praying to Hatchett know that Fajar is approaching so they can they wrap up and pray with her and those were asleep would be able to wake up and eat suhoor the pre-dawn meal in preparation but when the Adan of neomi Maktoum is called this is the adhan of fetcher so these are two events until today hamdulillah in Mecca and Medina it's still been practiced there is the first event which is just a reminder and in this event by the way we don't say asada - hi remain unknown twice we call the normal event which means that it is a reminder but the Advan of the actual break of dawn where you can pray and when you must stop eating and drinking this is the event where we say assalatu hi Roman and know me twice and I hope this answers your question"
