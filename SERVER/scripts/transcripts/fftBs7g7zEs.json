  "title": "Bought stolen item & used it for job, income haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "is if my brother buys a stolen SIM card and that SIM card has data and he uses the data for Uber to make money, is my dad's income haram? No this is not related to what your brother did. Buying a stolen item is haram for your brother but we do not cascade whatever resulted from such a transaction over other transactions. So if he used that stolen SIM card to get on an Islamic matrimonial app and he met a girl and they got married, is their nikah valid? What does this have to do with that? He's sinful for buying something that's stolen, he's sinful for using that stolen item and he will be held accountable on the Day of Judgment. What happens afterwards is not related to it and Allah knows best."
