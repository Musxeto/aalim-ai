  "title": "Can I stand outside the Church for a wedding in my NonMuslim family to maintain appearances? assim",
  "transcript": "revert to Islam, Alhamdulillah, and my family are not Muslim. They hate Islam. And whilst I'm still living at home with family, I wanted to know if there are close weddings that are coming up, because I don't earn a lot and the cost of living is high here, what to do? And for example, if these close weddings are at a church, for instance, could I attend but stand outside the church? And if there's a party, when there's lots of haram, stand outside, just showing other family members I've shown face but not arising in suspicion? And would this still, would I not be enjoying good and forbidding evil if I did this? If I went there but stood outside? It is not permissible, T, to attend disbeliever weddings, especially if it's in a church or a synagogue or a temple. This is totally prohibited. Believers don't attend or witness such falsehood. And likewise, it is not permissible for us to attend gatherings that haram and evil is being committed, such as mixed gatherings where there is liquor and haram food such as pork and the likes. So you must make a stance and you have to put your foot down and you have to say, listen, you're my relatives, I love you, and all this baloney, but at the end of the day, I cherish and adhere to the rulings of sharia, and in my religion, this is not permissible for me to attend. You will find some resistance, but it will all weather away inshallah, with the grace of Allah."
