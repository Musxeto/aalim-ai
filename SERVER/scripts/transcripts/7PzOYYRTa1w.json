  "transcript": "from India yes there is a ofam and mam on the topic of so I don't understand why was mam wrong m m was I I understand the Hadith the Hadith was that MSA was blaming Adam peace be upon him for eating from The Forbidden truth from from The Forbidden tree and as a consequence having him descended to Earth among his offspring so Musa was blaming him and he was saying that you the one who Allah created with his hands and the one who made the Angels prostrate to you you did this then Adam peace be upon him told him well you the one whom Allah spoke to and wrote the tablets with his hands for you are you blaming me for something that Allah has pre-ordained that I would do now the prophet Muhammad sallallahu Al wasallam said Adam has beaten in a sense in this debate mus why because MSA is blaming him over something that was done and Adam sought Allah's forgiveness and Allah forgave him and repent accepted his repentance so it's done how could you blame someone for that and Adam said to him how do you blame me for something that Allah has pre-ordained and I've acknowledged my mistake and I sought Allah's forgiveness and Allah forgave me and accepted my repentance so by this we understand that to blame someone for something he had done which he has already repented and got the Forgiveness of Allah is wrong yes someone who kills someone or steals money and I catch him red-handed I blame him for doing what he had done he cannot say this is Allah's uh uh Destiny Allah pre-ordained this upon me because he did not seek forgiveness and he was not forgiven by Allah unlike Adam who sought Allah's forgiveness repented to Allah and Allah accepted all of that and Allah Knows Best"
