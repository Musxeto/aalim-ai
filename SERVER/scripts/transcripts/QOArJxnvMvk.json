  "title": "Can we move to a Muslim country that does not practice Sharia Law, uses Alcohol, & no hijab?",
  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Is it permissible to move to a country whose population is over 95 percent Muslim and there's masjids everywhere so you can hear the van and there's no pork to worry about but Sharia law isn't implemented, the women don't cover up, and there's alcohol widespread in the restaurants and the stores? The answer is yes, no problem in that at all, because the vast majority of the population are Muslims and you're surrounded by them. So even if the Sharia law is not practiced and unfortunately the vast majority of Muslim countries don't practice Sharia law, yet this does not take them out of the fold of Islam or labels them as a non-Muslim country, still way, way better than any kafir country in the West or in the East and Allah knows best."
