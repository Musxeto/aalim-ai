  "transcript": "Abu Rayyan from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu My question is, Sheikh, yesterday after the Asr prayer, one of the imams made an announcement saying that so-and-so passed away, we already did his janazah, but now we want to make another prayer for him. And he instructed the imam that was leading the prayer to make a dua, and he instructed the congregation to all say ameen. And I'm wondering, what's the ruling on this? It is not permissible to announce the death of people in masjids like this. And the scholars say that announcing the deaths of people on pulpits or in the minarets is an innovation. It is also not permissible to repeat the funeral prayer as long as it was offered by other Muslims. So if the corpse or the deceased body is not there, why would we repeat the prayer again? This is not from the sunnah at all, and this was also wrong from them to do."
