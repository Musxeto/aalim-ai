  "title": "Can I pray the Sunnah AFTER the FARD? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Yasin from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh my question is can I pray the sunnah prayers which are before fard, after fard? When I for example first just want to pray fard and after praying fard I think to myself why didn't I pray the sunnah before fard? Jazak Allah Khair. If you missed the sunnah before the fard, let's assume it's dhuhr prayer and you prayed dhuhr fard directly and afterwards you said to yourself why didn't I pray the four rak'ah before that? I should have done that and you made it up afterwards. Inshallah this is permissible because whenever someone misses the sunnah he is allowed to make it up as mentioned in a number of hadiths and the Prophet himself Alayhi Salatu Wasalam made some of these sunnahs after the fard himself. So I hope that this is permissible inshallah."
