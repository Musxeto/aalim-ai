  "transcript": "Muhammad from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Yes, I have a question concerning Salat Duha So I read a hadith in Sahih Muslim that says It is better to pray Duha prayer after the sun's heat has become intense because the Prophet ï·º said It is preferable to offer Duha prayer when the sun's heat has become so intense that even the young of the camels feel it narrated by Muslim But I read another hadith that says It's a hadith Qudsi this time Allah, Blessed and Most High said Son of Adam, perform four rak'ahs for me in the beginning of the day It will suffice you for the later part of it by Tirmidhi So I'm a little bit confused and I wanted to know the best time to pray Salat Duha Thank you Sheikh The hadith of a Tirmidhi you referred to is an issue of dispute and Ibn Taymiyya may Allah have mercy on his soul and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim they consider this hadith referring to the two rak'ahs of Sunnatul Fajr and the two rak'ahs of Fareedatul Fajr These are the four rak'ahs to be prayed at the beginning of the day not to Duha prayer and the hadith of Sahih Liman Muslim is authentic and that the best time to pray Duha prayer is like 20 to 25 minutes before the time of Dhuhr and Allah knows best"
