  "title": "Does Shaykh Assim Al-Hakeem have knowledge in dream interpretation?",
  "transcript": "Adib from Bangladesh. Sheikh, my question is regarding a dream. Like, I saw a dream. I don't have any knowledge in dream interpretation, Adib. Anything related to halal, haram, I may help and I may not. But dreams, I have no knowledge of it. So I'm afraid I'm not the right person to interpret it. But generally speaking, if the dreams, when you woke up, you were saddened or frightened, this is from Shaytan definitely. If it's good and pleasing, then you should only tell it to those who love you so that when they interpret it to you, it would be good interpretation. I hope this answers you, Inshallah."
