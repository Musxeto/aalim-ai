  "transcript": "Sons of Tears. Then it was time for Fajr prayer. Bilal came and saw the Prophet ﷺ weeping and said, Prophet of Allah, why do you weep when Allah has forgiven your previous sins and the upcoming sins? So the Prophet said, O Bilal, shouldn't I be a grateful servant of Allah when He has given me such blessing and favour? Tonight, verses were revealed to me and these verses, woe and destruction might befall upon those who read them and not contemplate upon them, not give them thought. So the Prophet is warning us, if we do read these verses and not contemplate upon them."
