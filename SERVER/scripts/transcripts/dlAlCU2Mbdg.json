  "transcript": "from bangladesh my question is about najasa yes okay my sister last year faced some kind of mental problems like ocd types like uh she made a promise to allah that she will not love any boy on that kind but she broke it so later she regretted and like she used to get whispers from shaytan like if she touches anything uh for that boy satisfaction that thing and her she will become haram and you should like uh like small thoughts like if she moves her feet or something she will for that voice satisfaction she will become impure because she made a promise to allah that she will not like anyone so she and she once even committed shirk that she wants committed check like she was touching a thing and feeling as if she was touching allah and that made her feel guilty she's um talking about her sister and her sister promised allah azza vowed to allah not to date not to chit-chat not to be in communication with the opposite gender and probably she had a boyfriend and she cut her relationship with him and made that vow now she broke that vow or she feels that if she were to touch any of his gifts or to move with her feet anywhere near that boy's premises etc that this is shirk that this is kufur that she's uh touching a najasa etc all of these thoughts are whispers of shaytan a sin is a sin dating chatting being in a relationship this is a sin has nothing to do with shirk has nothing to do with things that i touch become impure or turn into gold for example no it has nothing to do with that these are separate things and a lot of those who are suffering from such mental illness this is not a mental illness rather it is ignorance in manifestation about islam so many people i speak to especially in the counseling sessions they're totally ignorant about the meaning of shirk or kuffur i did this and this is this gopher i said define kuffar for me he says huh um i don't know define shirk for me i don't know then why are you asking about it why not learn your religion i told so many callers that in the islamic on my youtube channel uh series 8 9 10 11 4 episodes i spoke in them about the types of kufr and things that nullify islam watch them document them learn them and then whenever shaytan comes and throws to you and says uh if you were saying insha allah and looked at a watch that your boyfriend or girlfriend gave to you and you think of that watch related to allah then this is kufur or shirk this is nonsense are you prostrating to the watch are you worshiping your boyfriend this is totally bogus has nothing to do with shirk or kofo so people have to relate and learn their religion to be on the safe side"
