  "transcript": "From the ladies' side, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Can you help us know how to raise girls who are at adolescence stage and are very rude to their parents? I don't know. This was my wife's role, not mine. I just finance. And when she tells me beat them up, I beat them up. But other than that, no. Seriously, raising up children is a gift from Allah Azza Wa Jal. When I was young, I was so full of energy and no wisdom. So all what I was good in is discipline. Don't do this, don't do that. Why didn't you pray? That's it. As you get older, you know, in your 30s and mid-30s, you become slower and wiser. Then you introduce love, compassion, care, quality time, and learn how to ignore some of the mistakes. When we're young, we never let anything slip. Why did you do this? Why did you do that? And we're always like a magnifying glass. Unfortunately, seeing only the negative things, never seeing a good thing. And this gives a lot of negativity to the individual. When you grow older, you learn the art of appreciation. MashaAllah, your dress is very beautiful. Oh, your hair is nice and calm. Your room is tidy. MashaAllah. Oh, who made the salad? MashaAllah, it's excellent. You give positivity. You receive positivity. But when you only are good in criticism, and a lot of the sisters, unfortunately, due to the load they have on their shoulders, tend to find this. That is, the husband is demanding. Her parents are demanding. The chores of the house are overwhelming. There are two or three kids in the house, and they are barely finding time to pray on time. They don't read the Quran or do dhikr as they want. They don't engage in their own hobbies. How would they feel? Frustrated. Where would they vent this frustration on? The children. Beating them up, shouting at them, always criticizing them, always saying negative things. How would the impact be on the children? Negative. Every action has a reaction. So you give them negative vibes, you'll get a negative reaction. Rudeness, impoliteness, never adhering to you. And you keep on pulling your hair, if you have any, and say, what have I done wrong? Well, you need to go to a therapist to clean your eyeglasses so you can see correctly. Once you adhere that, I need to invest. My children are my asset. I need to invest in them. Not just to monitor them or to control them with a remote control. It doesn't work. You have to give them six or seven years, especially when they're in their teens. A lot of encouragement, a lot of positive vibes, and look the other way at some of the things they do. They know you saw them, but when they see that you look the other way, they will not do it again. They say, oops, okay, we were saved this time. Next time we will be caught red-handed. No, we will not do it again. We will not do it again. And the more you think this way, how much quality time are you giving to your children? Zero. Whenever they want anything, okay, take these 500 shillings and go and buy some candy. Go to the fun fairs, go with your friends, go to your relatives, go play football, do anything, but just get off my case. No, you need to sit with them at lunch, at breakfast, at dinner, share with them some of your experiences, share with them some of your wisdom. Listen to them. One of the biggest problems I did in the beginning, I was a good khateeb. Whenever I sat with my children, I gave them khutbah jum'ah. I lectured them. Every time I speak to my daughters, they look at the watch, at the clock. I know. And I said to them, you're looking at the clock. No, no, no, I didn't mean that. They said, no, you're timing me. And they yawn. No, don't lecture them. Listen to them. Acknowledge what they're having at school, what they're feeling, what their aspirations, what they don't like. And contribute with your experience, with love and conviction. They will think that you're the best father in the world. And I am."
