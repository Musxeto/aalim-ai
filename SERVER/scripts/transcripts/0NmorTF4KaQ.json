  "title": "Have to wear Waterproof cream for Severe Eczema, how to make Wudu? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he I met from the UK I think he says that the cream he uses for his eczema is waterproof and it takes an hour to remove okay if you can't remove it then you have to remove it and make sure it's waterproof because sometimes is so greasy but it's not waterproof so if it is waterproof and it can be removed then you have to remove it if removing it causes more harm or would affect your eczema or the doctor say that you should not remove it then you should perform normal Woodill on all other limbs except the one that has the x'm on and afterwards you perform tayammum for skipping washing that area"
