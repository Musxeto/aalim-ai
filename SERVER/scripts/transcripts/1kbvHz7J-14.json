  "title": "Mispronounced Fatiha, keep repeating until rectified, am I making dua against myself? rabbighfirli",
  "transcript": "Isa from the UK. So if we unwillingly make a mistake in the pronunciation of Quranic verses such as Fatiha and Salah and words such as Rabbika Firali and Salah, should we keep on repeating them till we get it right or carry on which could mean that we could be making the war against ourselves. Can I give the examples or not? No, no need to do that. First of all, the Fatiha is a pillar. So if you are reciting it and you make a mistake that you know of, you have to rectify it. You have to repeat and read the verse correctly, not the whole Fatiha. So if you make a mistake in Iyaka Na'budu Wa Iyaka Nastaeen, simply repeat Iyaka Na'budu Wa Iyaka Nastaeen to recite it correctly. Otherwise your prayer is invalid. When you can rectify your mistake and you don't do so, then your prayer is invalid. As for Rabbika Firali, this is a mandatory act according to some because the dua between the prostration is an issue of dispute when sitting down saying Rabbika Firali, Rabbika Firali as per the Sunnah and I'm inclined to say that it is mandatory. However, if you make a mistake that does not shift or change the meaning, there is no problem in that and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
