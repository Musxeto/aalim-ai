  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So my question is what is the Islamic way for a woman in her 40s to meet a spouse? She doesn't have a father or a mother and she lives alone in a foreign country and her family doesn't believe in, they believe that you should date somebody first, know them for a few months or a few years before you marry them. Okay, first of all, Sharia law is something that is fixed. So we're not going to bend the rules and start to find loopholes that would fit individuals. Someone who comes and says, I don't have a Wali, I don't have a guardian, I live in a foreign country, I don't have any relatives around, so how am I to meet a potential spouse? The answer is, you don't. If you want, because of the previously mentioned reasons, to go on a dating app and swipe right or left or to just go for dinner or a drink or sitting in a public place with random men to check them out and they check you out, this is totally prohibited. Now, what to do, this is your problem. You're the one who decided to live in a foreign country and leave your family. If your family does not believe in an Islamic way and they believe in dating and the likes, you will find inevitably one who has some reason in him or you can convince him that, no, I want you to meet the potential person and if he checks all the boxes, I will meet with him in your presence, etc. If this is not applicable, if you live in the Emirates, you go and meet with the Islamic centers maybe or the Islamic court where they conduct marriages and see if they have a committee that would do such a thing for you and usually they are organized, mashallah, in the Emirates and things go quite smoothly. They have a good policy and procedure regarding these things. So Islamic centers may conduct, in the presence of the imam and his wife maybe or the imam himself, a gathering where you could sit with a potential suitor who would sit with you and after checking him out and seeing that he fits the profile that you're looking for, then that would be fine, inshallah.
