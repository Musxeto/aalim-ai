  "transcript": "from bangladesh that he feels that something is coming out and he checks and he opens his private part to check but actually it's inside so nothing actually comes out the wudu is intact and you're sinful for doing that for investigating in this fashion for opening your private part in that manner which would lead to infection and it would be lead to severe case of ocd 95 of the counseling sessions i do are because of this and it takes 20 to 25 minutes to talk them and give them a lecture how to overcome this obsession and alhamdulillah it works but never check never do anything like that if you manage to do this inshallah you will conquer your ocd you"
