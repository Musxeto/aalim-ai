  "transcript": "uh questioner says as a wife who feels uncomfortable during intimacy always and informs her husband about how she feels and he just apologizes apologizes and it's the same way always and she doesn't want to offer herself sometimes because she doesn't get excited about it is she sinful if she says no now if we were to answer this question most likely the feminists would would draw their guns and wage war and if we don't answer this question we would be accountable at the site of allah azzawajal for concealing knowledge so this answer is according to islamic rulings according to the quran and to the sunnah whether people like it or not this is not my job to make them like it my job is to clarify the rulings to the muslims who ask about it what is the ruling number one if there is harm physically on the woman she is permitted to refrain and not offer herself and not permit him to harm her this is her god-given right number two if she is only not feeling excited and she's not enjoying it but it's not harming her and there is no hardship on her or physical harm on her it is prohibited for herself to it is prohibited for her to prevent herself from offering herself to him because marriage is based on such intimacy why would a man marry a woman and pay a dowry and open a house put a roof on her head provide for her provide for her food not ask her for any financial contribution none whatsoever why would he do that simply so that he could enjoy staying with her and being intimate with her in a halal way if she prevents him from having his rights the prophet without any legitimate reason the prophet told us allah that the angels would curse her all night long till the break of dawn and this is every single night so this is a major sin and she has to be really careful not to do that if she is not happy in the marriage she can bail out she can ask for hurt give him back his dowry and she goes to her father's house without no problems without any harm done but to stay in the marriage and for him to provide for her and to live with her without having his rights this is unfair and illogical you"
