  "transcript": "flag from Bangladesh so Sheikh I tried to ask you the same question as the previous episode of the last episode but I feel like I wasn't able to ask you my question properly so I want to ask you my question again can you ask if the question check I don't remember your question okay so actually my question was can we say may Allah reward you greatly the disbelievers when they do a good work what's the problem in that what yes what is the problem in saying to someone who helped me carry a big box she cannot say to the disbelievers to say to the disbelievers may Allah reward you know yes yes no most likely because this is if you intended that Allah would reward them in this life yeah this isn't this is permissible but leave it like this generally without having this intention no we cannot pray for the disbelievers in terms of mercy of forgiveness or anything good in the Hereafter because we know that they're destined to Hell Fire due to their disbelief but we can pray for their goodness in this world may you get healthy may you get wealthy may Allah Grant you good things in this life there's nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
