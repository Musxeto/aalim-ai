  "transcript": "Fuad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah So Sheikh actually my question was can a person use fireworks to celebrate Islamic occasions like when the month of the Ramadan begins or at the night of the Eid or it's an imitation of the disbelievers Sheikh Jazakallah Khairan Wa Jazak When you say imitating the disbelievers this answers your question so what's the point of asking it however is it imitating the disbelievers this is an issue a lot of the people may beg to differ why because they would also claim that having a car is imitating the disbeliever hanging ornaments in the house is also imitating the disbelievers and this is not true imitating the disbelievers must be related to their customs the traditions their religions that no one else share it with them fireworks is highly widely spread in all over the world and it's practiced in everywhere now sometimes once every blue moon it's a joyful sight to see and if there is a purpose for that and the families may enjoy it that might be fine I personally see that it is a huge waste of money and it's actually burning your money with fire firecrackers or fireworks that you pay literally hundreds of thousands to execute sometimes even more there are companies dedicated for this and some of them do charge an arm and a leg maybe millions for what for five minutes of fireworks so I don't like it personally I would not go and watch it because I feel ashamed sort of to have so much money going down the drain but what I I come to the conclusion that this is imitating the kuffar and it's haram and it's no but it is waste of money unless it's done moderately once every blue moon and for a good purpose and Allah azza wa jal knows best"
