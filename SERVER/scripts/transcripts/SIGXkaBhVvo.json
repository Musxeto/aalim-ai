  "title": "Muslim Judge & Studying Law | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "judges should have a thorough knowledge and this is extremely important you remember that we said that the prophet salam told us that there are three types of judges and by the way these three types are not percentage wise so 33 33 and 33 no it is classification wise so you could have one out of a hundred who's a good righteous judge in 99 who are in hell so those who do not have knowledge those who do not possess the necessary knowledge to work as judges they are in big trouble and i always tell those who opt to study law and i've seen some of my own relatives doing this and i gave them the warning that you cannot study law without mastering the islamic sharia law and unfortunately in most countries islamic countries there is this clear segregation where people study the french law the british law american law commercial law the administrative law without mastering the islamic law and this causes a lot of confusion especially to young muslim students and this is why the fatwa from the major great scholars of our times is that it is not permissible to study law unless you can master the islamic sharia law after that yes you can study british law french law and you will find that most of it is based on islamic law but there are aspects that you have to be really careful when studying if you are not qualified in the islamic law because this would cast doubts on your own islam and you don't want to go there you don't want to have issues with your own religion simply because you're ignorant so a muslim judge must have thorough knowledge of what of the quran of the sunnah he has to be well versed in all aspects of the islamic faith he has to be able to distinguish what is right and what is wrong and he has to be keen to maintain justice so it's not only the knowledge you have it's the person you are imam ashafe and we know that imam shafi is among the first to write in and specifically in us in his great book which is considered to be the benchmark on fundamentals of phil so he clearly stated that this judge has to be of a certain scholarly level that allows him to do ishtihad and he has to have sound knowledge in the quran in the things that were abrogated or not he has to have knowledge in tafsir in hadith the authenticity of hadith from weakness these give him the out lying verdicts and rulings he should have knowledge of his predecessors opinions over similar verdicts and different cases where the scholars agreed upon on a specific issue where they differed and disagreed and he has to be well versed in arabic language and in analogy oral pias so in a nutshell a muslim judge should be highly qualified individual unfortunately nowadays there is this tendency to downplay the importance of sharia law so the vast majority of judges we see they may look practicing and righteous but their knowledge is based on knowledge they had rather than to follow and mimic and imitate previous cases that were precedents and this is how they work nowadays in courts of law there is anderson versus johnson case in 1994 so this was a president and the judge takes the same rulings of this case that came before him not based on the quran or the sunnah which is strongly founded on sharia law and this is a problem because now people don't solve their arbitrations through islamic sharia rather than previous cases using analogy not in the quran the sunnah but in different previous cases and this is totally wrong and not true"
