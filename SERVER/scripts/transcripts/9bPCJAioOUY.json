  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah who was prophet Muhammad wasam it is important to know that Allah selected our Prophet Alat wasam from a lineage that had no Haram in it so there was no fornication no illegitimate children all from the time of Adam till the prophet Alam were pure marriages and lineages and this is something that indicates that Allah selected Prophet Muhammad Alat wasam from the whole of humanity so that he would send us the best of the best and when we say that he's the best man ever to walk the earth this is not an exaggeration his name was Muhammad the son of Abdullah the son of Abdul mutalib the son of Hashim the son of ABD the son of K the son of kab and the son in Arabic is bin so we would say bin AB B Malik as narrated by Imam bukari all of these are the ancestors of prophet Muhammad alhat wasam and Adan is of The Offspring of is and is is the the son of or one of the sons of ibraim peace be upon them all so the prophet was the best of the best and we have to understand that Allah selected the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam from the best of lineage because people till date when we when they want to discredit someone they look at faults in his parents his grandparents and it say oh one of his ancestors was this or that so Allah selected the prophet from such a lineage to close the door for anyone to speak ill about him sallallah alai Ali wasallam now we said that his name was Muhammad abdah so his father was Abdullah and Abdullah was one of the handsome youngsters of quray and quray is the dominant tribe of Mecca and Abdullah was known to be a the one who was to be sacrificed and slaughtered and so was his great great grandfather is who was destined to be sacrificed as a vision that came to ibraim peace be upon him and then Allah asael compensated that sacrifice with a big Ram that we still sacrifice when we go to Hajj or in in the Eid of Al and the story of why Abdullah was called a a a sacrifice or the one who was to be slaughtered is quite long and our time is pretty limited but his father ransomed gave a ransom of a 100 camels just to free him from an oath he made to slaughter him when he found the well of zamzam which was hidden for some time the father of Abdullah is The Honorable Abdul mutalib who was the grandfather of our Prophet Alam and he was the leader of quray at the time the most dignitary person at the time the mother of our Prophet was am B wah and her father was the leader in the tribes head of bani zra and his grandfather as we've mentioned was Abdul mutalib now when was the prophet bornat the the the the Arabs used to remember events or important dates by events that took place so the prophet was born in the year of the elephant and what is the year of the elephant we have 12 months in the lunar calendar the third month is r and historian differed whether he was born on the 12th of r or the 9th or the eth but they do not differ that he was born in the year of the elephant and this is the year where there was an attempt by the ruler of abenia who gave his instruction to the ruler of Yemen to go and demolish the Kaaba so he marched to destroy the Kaa with a huge army with elephants accompanying them and elephants were not known in Arabia and these elephants alongside with the Army were not defeated by men because the people people of quray took refuge in the mountains and fled they would not stand in their way Mecca and the Kaa was defended by Allah where Birds came throwing pibbles and stones that penetrated everything and everyone killing them defeating them in minutes and this was mentioned in the Quran in the chapter known as the elephant so the prophet was born in that particular year if you read the stories of s you will find that a number of Miracles were associated with with his birth some of them are not authentic and we can see that it is an over exaggeration and his status sallallahu alaihi wasallam does not require us to fabricate things that are not authentic nevertheless it was mentioned so we may just skip it and move on without paying a great deal of attention such as the stories where the Palaces and mansions of the rulers and leaders of Persia and the bantia and the Romans Shook and some of the bank balconies collapsed or a light came from Mecca and it made the whole world shine all of these are not that authentic so we would not pay a great deal of attention to it when the prophet wasam was a fetus in his mother's womb his father died and his mother died when he was six years of age and his his grandfather Abdul mutalib who took care of him died when he was 8 years of age tragedy after tragedy only to indicate that no one will raise this child except Allah no one will take care of him except Allah and this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran that his favor and blessing upon him that he is the one who found him an orphan and took care of him he the one who found him poor and made him rich and so forth and we have to also highlight the fact that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had never ever celebrated his own birthday nor did his beloved close companions whether while he was alive or after his death they had never ever celebrated his birthday nor did the the best generation to come after the companions nor did the so if you look around you will find that the vast majority of Muslims celebrate his birthday and feast on that particular day with Innovations with fabricated things and sometimes with shik so is it permissible if something that the prophet did not doam nor his companions nor the or who dares to claim that this is a good Sunnah when the religion was completed in the lifetime of the Prophet Al am this is a clear and Innovation that Muslims should avoid moving on to his wet nurses why would anyone have a wet nurse when he has a mother this was the norm with the elite families of Arabia that once they give birth to their children they give their children as infants to what nurses from rural areas so that they can take them where outside of the cities where it's the air is fresh the food is clean and they would learn proper Arabic that was not spoiled by different nations coming to their cities and this happened with the prophet Alat and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had two wet nurses the first one was thba and she was the concubine or the slave woman of Abu laab who is or was the uncle of the Prophet Alat who died as a cafir and who was cursed by Allah in the Quran and the second wet nurse was Hal and she was a hired with nurse who came looking for an infant to take care of and did not find anyone suitable because no one accepted to take Prophet Muhammad Alam due to him being an orphan and women would take this child to breastfeed and take care of in order that his father would G compensate them with gifts and money at the end of their Mission but with an orphan who would do this but at the end of the day when everybody went back to their tribes successfully she did not want to go empty-handed so she accepted to take Prophet Muhammad and the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam had two brothers through his with nurses so he had Hamza his own Uncle Hamza ABD mutalib was also the brother of the Prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam through suckling and Abu Sal whom the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam after he died in Medina married his wife and his wife became the mother of the Believers um Sal as we will discuss later on inshallah there was an incident when the prophet was with Hala and she was taking care of him at or in these rural areas with her tribe in benis where he was playing with the children when he was about four years of age when all of a sudden gibel the Archangel appeared and and he took the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he cut his chest in an operation taking his heart and washing it in Zam Zam water in a balll of gold and then place it back again and saw his chest again fixed it saying to him that this is the portion that Shan would have utilized from you it was all gone cleansed and purified anas used to say may Allah be pleased with him I used to see the trace of this operation in the prophet's chest of course a 40-year-old child this happening to him and the children running to his wit nurse his his suckling mother saying to her your son has been killed and she sees him with a pale face she was afraid for his safety and she did not want to take his responsibility so she traveled and took him back to his mother when he was about four years of age and this is all the time we have for today's class until we meet you in the third class I Leave [Music] [Music] You [Music] for"
