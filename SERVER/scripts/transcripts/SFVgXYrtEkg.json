  "transcript": "We have our first caller, Brother Yunus from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Sheikh, my grandfather accepted Islam secretly, but I feel that his Christian relatives may cremate him after his death. So, the thing is, if I talk to him, I feel that he may be hesitant to practice Islam anymore because he maybe accepted a few months ago. And I'm only 16. If he now dies and I start to fight with my relatives about how he should be buried, I may get into trouble. How old is your grandfather? 87 or so. So, is he healthy or are you going to kill him soon? He is not that healthy. His wife just died. His what? My grandmother died. She was 85. She looked just like him and died a few weeks ago. Okay, and how is his health? He is in pension. He is in home for the elderly. Okay, my advice to you is not to put hurdles. Rather, be positive, proactive. Go and visit him almost every day. Try to speak to him how to elevate his Iman. Try to speak to him about the beauty of Islam, the beautiful names of Allah. Talk to him about a little bit of the seerah. Talk to him about one or two ayat of the Quran. Strengthen his Iman in the six pillars of Iman, to believe in Allah, the day of judgment, the angels, the messengers, the scriptures, and in the divine decree, whether good or bad. Try to focus on these things little by little diplomatically so that he would be proud of his Islam, to strengthen his Islam. And inshallah, in a few weeks time, maybe a month or two, if he gets strong and declares his Islam to his children and to those around him, then you can ask him to write a paper or a will not to be cremated after death. And Allah azza wa jal knows best. For more information visit www.fema.org"
