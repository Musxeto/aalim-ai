  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I wanted to ask about a Hadith that a lot of people have been quoting about It's about regarding the time when the Prophet ﷺ was passing away The Hadith states that when the Prophet ﷺ was on his deathbed The Angel of Death came and gave him an option that Allah has granted you a choice To either stay in this world or come to the heavens And the Prophet ﷺ preferred going to Allah than staying on earth And the Prophet ﷺ said that all the messengers are given this option I'm not sure of the authenticity of this Hadith I tried checking it and I didn't find anything to prove that this is correct So I just wanted to ask you that is this Hadith correct or is it something that people are just saying Jazakallah Khair To my knowledge the Hadith is authentic There is no Prophet except he would be given the choice And this is out of courtesy Because all messengers know that they're inevitably going to die As in the Hadith of Musa when the Angel of Death came to him But he came to him in the form of a human being Musa was startled peace be upon him So he punched him and knocked one of his eyes off So the Angel of Death went angrily to Allah Azza wa Jal And said let me have my way with this man He popped my eye off And he said no go to him introduce yourself and tell him who you are And give him the choice So he went back and he asked Musa after introducing himself To whether he wants to live or die And if he wanted to live He should place if I'm recalling correctly If I'm not mixing up apples with oranges When he said okay how long if I wanted to extend my life He said put your hand on a bull And whatever hair your hands cover You'll be given a year for each hair Let's assume it's 5,000 hairs Then you live another 5,000 years Musa said then what? After the 5,000 years have expired The Angel of Death said then death Musa said if this is the case Then now better than later on So it's out of courtesy that they're giving the choice And the Prophet peace be upon him He chose He chose to be in the companionship of the Prophets The Siddiqeen, the martyrs and the righteous And Allah knows best"
