  "title": "Most people have a little income so who should I give Kaffarat Al Yameen to (expiation broken oath)",
  "transcript": "Our first caller is Chaudhry from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh this is a question regarding Kafaratul Yameen. Sheikh you said not to give it to people who have income or are professional beggars. So most people who I see have at least a little income from selling small things or such. So who should I give it to? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. The Kafaratul Yameen or the expiation for breaking an oath was mentioned in Suratul Ma'idah Chapter 5 where Allah Azza Wa Jal says to feed 10 poor people from the average food you consume or to clothe them or to free a slave. And if you're unable financially to do the previous three things you can choose any one of them. In this case you have to fast three days if you're financially unable. Now what is the definition of miskeen? We have poor whose stone broke and we have someone who's a bit better than him better than him and he's al miskeen, the needy. Al faqeer or the poor is the person who is totally broke. If he has lunch he may not have dinner. He may not have a house to live in. He is someone that is desperate and has nothing. While al miskeen or the person who's needy is someone who is better off than a poor person. He has a house, he may even have a car and a job but he does not have the essentials that complete an honorable life. So yes he has food on the table but he doesn't have enough to for example buy medicine or to take his children to school or to buy them clothes. He has a car but he doesn't have money to fix it so that he could work on it and bring some income. This guy has the essentials but not what completes it. So you can give your zakat money, you can give kaffarah tul yameen, the expiations of broken oaths or expiations in general to such individuals and Allah knows best."
