  "title": "How to help those who did not make Hijrah? Surah Al Anfal ayah 72 No Racism in Islam Assim AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "that those who believed and embraced islam but did not migrate to islamic state you are under no obligation to protect them until they immigrate yet it is your obligation to help them in the matters of faith if they ask for your help so now how can we help them because allah says that it is an obligation it is your obligation to help them okay i will try to answer your question uh uh sumayyah from dubai says 70 2 and if we were to go to that verse it would not take us a lot insha allah and this is verse 72 and it it's a long verse where allah azza wajal says those who believed emigrated and strived with their wealth and lives in the cause of allah as well as those who gave them shelter and help they are truly guardians of one another okay this is understood is talking about the bond between the believers among themselves they are guardians of one another as for those who believed but did not immigrate you have no obligation to them until they emigrate but if they seek your help against persecution in faith it is your obligation to help them accept and this is what she did not read except against people bound with you in a treaty so what does that mean it means that the muslims are brothers and they are like bricks of a wall each brick tightens the other and supports it and this is how all muslims should be whether you are in the states or in europe or in the middle east or in china or in india muslims are brothers we don't care what color you are we don't care what ethnicity you are originally from we care whether you say ash muhammad in rasulullah or not so if you say it then you are my brother and i shake hands with you and i embrace you and i say assalamu alaikum whenever i see you when i do not do this with a non-muslim he's an acquaintance he's a normal person i don't have any bound uh bond i do not have any bond towards the non-muslim even if he's from my same country so even if he's from my own country from my own village from my own tribe from my own people but he is a secularist or an atheist or speaks ill about islam he is not from me he doesn't belong to me even if he shares my my my parents he is my sibling but he doesn't belong to me my allegiance is to that who is a muslim but if that muslim is being prosecuted and did not migrate allah tells us that it is his fault for not migrating you cannot support him because he is living in a cafe country now if he's prosecuted and he's unable to migrate then it's the duty of the muslims at large to help except if he is living in a country that has treaties with us muslims so most two countries that have treaties and one country that has a treaty is prosecuting muslims the muslims are their hands are tied because they cannot break the treaties they have and the muslims there must do their level best to migrate if we can't help them we make dua for them we support them with money if we can deliver that to them and with whatever things in our possession and finally"
