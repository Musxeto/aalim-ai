  "transcript": "Shahrookh from Singapore Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam So Sheikh let's say someone has memorized certain surahs of Quran and they like to refresh them during the daily salah and in order to make sure that they don't miss out on anything they like to follow a certain sequence so let's say on Friday Surah Baqarah then on Saturday Surah Al-e-Imran and then so on and they like to follow it in the same sequence they have there in Quran and similarly when they say the daily Askar like the morning and evening they like to follow a certain sequence so that they don't forget anything or miss out on anything so will this be considered like any sort of like bidah or any other issue with this? JazakAllah Wa Jazak when a person designates a particular verses of the Quran or a surah for Friday another one for Saturday another one for Sunday not because it's Friday Saturday and Sunday rather because this is easier for him to keep up revising it or it's a system that he follows there's nothing wrong in that the bidah the innovation is when you think that oops I read Al-Baqarah on a Saturday I should have done it on Friday then I have to do it all over again and blah blah blah no this is wrong because you're giving the day an importance that has no importance in regard of revising a particular surah and the same fashion or the same thing goes with your order of reciting the morning and evening Askar there is no problem in a particular sequence that you're fine and comfortable with"
