  "title": "Is it mandatory to wear gloves outside the home? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it mandatory to wear gloves when a woman goes out of her home this is an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that covering the hands is mandatory whether you cover it with your Iberia or you cover it with a glove or you do whatever to conceal it because the woman all in all is a aura as in the hadith men have developed over the years the gift or the curse I don't know it can be both of identifying the weight of a woman her size her color complexion her age from just looking at her hand and sometimes and I am a man I see this in the market sometimes women's hands only although she's covered from head to toe her hand is so gorgeous that shaitaan beautifies it in your eyes this is how Shaitaan works and he gives you oh she's probably 28 years of age um she's not fat she's a bit skinny that's good this is this this is that and Shaitan works in the men's minds dirty minds yes they are this is how they were created this is how they think unfortunately so this is why Allah tells men to lower their gaze so that they won't cause to themselves fitna but at the same time tells women to cover themselves properly so wearing the gloves is not mandatory in itself it was there at the time of the Prophet Elisha salam but covering the hands is what should be done"
