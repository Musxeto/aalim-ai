  "transcript": "Aisha from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Yeah, I wanted to know if I decided that I wanted to increase my istighfar more than a hundred times a day, would I be doing an innovation? Not at all. You can do istighfar a thousand times, a gazillion times. You can fill up your day and night with istighfar."
