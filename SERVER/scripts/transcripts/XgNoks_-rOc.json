  "transcript": "min minute Selam aleykum Selam if you are ill and they cannot do anything about it and you try you tried everything do an asana and still it gets worse don't I become desperate about it what can I do well you can't do anything but to continue making dua hoping that Allah social would reward you for it because at the end of the day it is not Simon Says and it happens it is not making dua and boom it's in front of me no you are a slave of Allah so Allah if Allah chooses to torture you for sixty years of your age and then throws you in hell you cannot complain you cannot object you cannot do anything about it you are a lost property so the only way for you out is to acknowledge my life in this life is a mere test Allah Allah is testing us so you have to acknowledge the fact that what you're going through is a test from Allah and you have no alternative no choice but to be patient to be content not to object not to complain but rather acknowledge that all what is happening to you has been preordained fifty thousand years before Allah created occasion so it's done and over with you cry you bang your head on the wall you throw yourself from a high riser you drown yourself everything was predestined and you'll be punished for your action so the only alternative to have is to be content that Allah Azza WA JAL is wise fair knowledgable he whatever he predestined upon me is for a better reason and I have no alternative except to be patient few days and we all meet our maker and Allah makes it easy for all of us"
