  "transcript": "I place for me to okay I understand your question now so many times we are challenged if we want a job if we want to secure a place in the University if we want to win a contract of a company the people ask for a bribe so what's the ruling on giving a bribe the prophet saidat may Allah curse the one who gives a bribe and receives a bribe and another narration and the one interfering between them the commissioner the one who's trying to facilitate things but this is a weak uh addition so if this is something that is your right or you're preventing harm from coming to you it is permissible meaning I bought a car from America my own money and it's this year's model I shipped it all the way to Mombasa I went to clear it from the customs and the custom agent was eating C again can I have my car all the documents are there the bill of freight and I don't know what they call it and the custo I paid everything he said well you have to give something from under the table but this is Haram har I'm not going to give you your car if you want sue me go to the highest Authority I'm not going to give it to you is this my right yes this is my car I paid for it and he is standing in my way of clearing my car in this case if there is no other way I can give bribe and he will be cursed by Allah not me likewise if someone comes and says oh your restaurant is uh very nice masallah if you don't give me this I will close it for you why you going to close it because I want money I have the authority I'm a government official I try to look and ask and help nobody's helping so yes I have to give him $500 and he will go away I have to give it now to get this job of yours is it your right no it's the right of everyone to get a contract is it your right no you don't have to get the contract to go work somewhere where else and likewise so this is the criteria where you can justify giving a bribe from not giving one and Allah Knows Best"
