  "title": "ðŸ†• Reward for sitting in the same spot after prayer to make dhikr (men & Women) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Amatullah says, is sitting on the same spot after Fard prayer limited to those who pray in the masjid or women praying at home also get similar rewards? Also, is it allowed to only sit on the same position or one can change positions or lie down on the same place as well? The rule is that we take only one question, but these are emails, so we may make an exception, we may not. So, is sitting on the same spot after Fard prayer limited to those who pray in masjid or women praying at home? This depends on the reward you are looking for. If you are talking about the hadith where the Prophet says, Alayhis salatu wasalam, whoever prays in congregation and remains seated where he had prayed, remembering Allah till the sun rises and then prays two rak'ah, then Allah would grant him as if he completed Umrah and Hajj complete, complete, complete. This is only for those who pray in the masjid. But if you are talking about the hadith where the Prophet says, you are still in prayer, even if you concluded your prayer, as long as you are sitting in the position where you had prayed, unless you break your wudu or move out, move away. In this case, your reward is disconnected. So, for the second hadith, yes, a woman who sits after Fard prayer on her same spot, remembering Allah, she is considered to be praying, even if she doesn't remember Allah. If she just sits there, the angels write as if she is still praying and continuing to pray. Can she lie down? I don't know. I could not say yes or no. Can she move somewhere else? Yes. The most authentic opinion among scholars regarding the first hadith in the masjid, that moving in the same masjid, in the vicinity of the masjid, would still grant you the reward and Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you are entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they are poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah, Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
