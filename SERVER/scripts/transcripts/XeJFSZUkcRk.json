  "title": "Is lying a Major Sin? What is the punishment for spreading lies? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hasan's second question is lying a major sin he says we know that we are allowed to lie in three cases but other than these cases would lying be a major sin the answer is it depends it can be major sin and it can be a minor sin and among the minor sins is when you lie jokingly and this is his third question this is not permissible and some say it is not recommended but the most authentic opinion is lying jokingly is not permissible unless they know for sure that you're joking in this case it becomes not recommended but even if they did not know as long as you're joking and it's not something of seriousness it's not a major sin it's a minor sin as for the punishment for lying he recalls a hadith that the prophet saw in one of the visions a man standing behind another one sitting down incoming with a piece of iron and putting it in his mouth and tearing it to the back of his neck and then he does the same with the other side and when he does this the other one heals and he keeps on doing this until the day of judgment this is in the grave so the Prophet asked who is this and why is this being done to him and they tell him the angels with him that this is from a person who lies and his lie spreads all over the globe so this fits like a glove the people of the media who spread fake news as they say the people on what's app the people on social media where people take whatever they say and publish it and relay it this falls in that category but this is only for such mass lies other lies they depend on their gravity and Allah knows best"
