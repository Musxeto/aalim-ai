  "title": "When we say Ya, is it Ya Rabal Alameen or Rabul Alameen? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sadia from Bangladesh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah My Arabic teacher said that Rabbul Alameen is Allah's name and when we call him by this name we should say Ya Rabbul Alameen, not Rabbul, but Rabbal. Like this we should say Ya Rabbul Arshil Azim, Ya Rabbul Arshil Khorin, Ya Rabbul Samawati Wal Arsh, etc. So is this true? This is true. When you add the calling article Ya, then what comes afterwards has to be mansub, Ya Rabbul Alameen, Ya Arham Arrahimeen. So we put a fatha on it and we don't say Ya Rabbul Alameen, rather we say Ya Rabbul Alameen, Ya Arham Arrahimeen, Ya Aziz, Ya Hakim, because it is, no, Ya Aziz, Ya Hakim, this is different. Rabbul Alameen is mudaf and mudafideh, and this is why it is used with fatha, but when it is Ya Allah, it is with a dhammah. And either way, Alhamdulillah, this is a grammatical mistake that would not impact your dua if you don't know the ruling of it, and Allah knows best."
