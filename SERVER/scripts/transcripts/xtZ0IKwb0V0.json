  "title": "If we don't consider them as Kafir, then our own Islam is Nullified? (Takfeer on those who do kufr)",
  "transcript": "from Canada is about not making that feel but rather considering someone to be careful or a mortar from like our point of biryani so like when it comes to like the kufara like Christian Hindus or darwas Etc the metal is crystal clear but my question is regarding those who are claim to be Muslims but or apostasy whether it be by directions or speech or beliefs that become apparent so what should be our approach towards them like I'm asking this because whenever the question of considering someone a cancer or Mozart arises people also point out that if we don't consider them to be a career field then our own Islam is nullified as well so the last thing in me or any other Muslim would want is to notify our Islam because we're not uh because of samuta and please give me a solved answer this is a very wide topic the issue of techfir is a very sensitive issue and the problem is that when you read a small booklet about the 10 nullifiers of Islam and you take them as if they are Divine words as if they are Revelations from the Quran or from the Sunnah and you want to implement them not knowing that these are the work of Scholars honorable great Scholars who may hit it the nail right on the head or may have made a mistake out of their ishtihad now it is our problem when we read such literature and want to Cascade it without the proper knowledge so a theoretical uh assumption or a an idea we take it embrace it and want to practice it and then not only that we go an extra mile by saying that if you don't implement this then you're a kaffir as well subhanallah so this is a new religion altogether that we are embracing and this what results in nicest Al-Qaeda Etc who go on cascading things and as a result if you don't do this then you're this and if you don't do this you're this if the ruler does not rule by Sharia then he's kaffir the ministers are cafes their husband their wives and children are captured the Army is Cafe the Civil defenses Cafe the paper pushers are kafir the janitors are kafir who are guarding their what is this this is not Islam but this is how shaytan messes up with people's heads so going back to the fundamentals to be careful in not giving for the whole entire population is better than giving to a single person to refrain to say I'm not ready to spoil my Iman by giving take fear to an individual let alone a group of people based on the speculation that they have said or done something that is allegedly allegedly takes him out of the fold of Islam No there are conditions to be fulfilled I did not have the time to interrogate and sit with them and explain to them to see if the conditions are fulfilled or not there are obstacles to make sure that are not found before giving takfir and this is something to be done by Scholars after sitting and talking with that individual and ensuring that everything falls into place by a panel of Judges not by Tom Dick and Hattie not by you and me so don't go that route because this is what shaytan wants from you you're doubtful Let It Be Allah did not send me to label people to sit on a cafe drinking my cappuccino and say okay this is Cafe this is this is Fajr this is munafirk this is this he belongs to that group this is not my job Allah did not send me to do this and Allah will not question me why I did not do that and Allah Knows Best foreign"
