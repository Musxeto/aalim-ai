  "transcript": "um are there differences in akhida within ethere i think he believes within the ethereal there are claims that ethere that the ethereal ethereal of today is not the same as the akita back in the time of ahmed ibn this issue of difference of opinion in arcadia matters is a very sensitive and delicate issue so people say did the companions differ on issues of alpeda the vast majority say they did not because when you speak about akida the first thing that comes up to people's minds are the essential differences today whether the attributes of allah azzawajal like the ashari's believe in are limited to seven attributes of allah and everything else is not which is definitely waco all these attributes mentioned in the quran this is not what it is meant this is metaphoric this is this this is that which totally changed is data so when you say that companions differ than issues of akida our salafi people immediately grow up horns and want to attack thinking that we're talking about ashari or murtazili or kadari or all of these the companions differed in no no no definitely not the companions that never ever had any issues of this when you come down a little bit then you start to have these issues coming up but what is the use of it only to preoccupy you in argument and debates that have zero benefit to you or to islam or to the muslims the issues of al-qaeda that the ethere or the salafi people have differed over are negligible and they're not in fundamental issues like in taheed like in the beautiful names and attributes of allah like in belief in qatar or belief or the six pillars of islam in general they differed whether the dead can hear you or not they differ in issues that are similar to that but not of great importance so to come today and try to make an issue out of it or to occupy muslims by asking questions that are irrelevant i would definitely ignore and move on because this is not helpful at all and there is no use of it who cares follow the quran and sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors to the best of your ability and if there is a difference of opinion over whether yeah for example seven on the day of judgement are shaded in the shade of allah where there is no shade other than the shade of allah does allah have a shade some scholars say no this is metaphoric among the salafi movement because this may insinuate that is light that allah gives shades to blah blah blah and some say no this is like the attributes of allah we have to believe in it as it is so others say no no no it's not the shade of allah it's a shade of the throne of allah it's a shade that allah creates and not history this is trivial in a sense issue to compare it to the difference between our akida and so don't preoccupy people with such things and follow the quran and sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors you"
