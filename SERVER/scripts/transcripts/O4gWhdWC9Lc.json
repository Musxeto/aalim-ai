  "title": "Should I make sujood as sahu if I made a mistake in 1st Tashahhud behind the Imam",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So I was praying behind the imam and I made a problem like I missed the first shahood and when the imam said salam I did the sujood al sahoo. How did you miss the first shahood Ahmed? Like I made a mistake. How? Explain it to me. I said it wrong. Explain it to me Ahmed. I missed like parts of it. I didn't miss the whole thing but I missed parts of it. And you could not wrap it up before the imam stood up for the third shahood, for the third rakah? Yeah so I did the forgiveful sujood. So is this correct or? No it is not. It is not correct. The hadith of the prophet alayhis salatu wasalam states that al imamu ba'min and al muadhinu mu'taman. Al muadhinu mu'taman meaning that he is to be trusted. When he calls the adhan, it's sunset, the adhan is called, I eat. I don't have to go and open the windows to say okay the sun is setting or not. He's entrusted with the time. He's the timekeeper. Wal imamu ba'min. The imam is a guarantor. He guarantees that our prayer is valid and accepted by following him. This means that as long as I fulfilled the pillars of the salat behind the imam, then he carries any mistake I may have done in obligatory actions or voluntary actions. So for example, I've started with the imam from the beginning. Allahu Akbar. We go for ruku. Subhana rabbiyal azeem. I forgot. Instead I recited the fatiha in ruku. I was so absent-minded. He said sami'allahu liman hamidah. I said Rabbana walakal hamd. He said whoa, what the heck had I done? I missed subhana rabbiyal azeem. What should I do? Nothing. Don't I prostrate for forgetfulness? No. The imam carries that for you. So the first shahood has the same ruling. It's mandatory. It's not a pillar. Pillars like fatiha, like ruku, like tranquility, like raising from ruku, or sujood, sitting between the sujood, etc. These are pillars. You miss one of them, the whole rak'ah is gone. You have to make another rak'ah after salam. But mandatory acts, if you skip them due to ignorance or an error or forgetfulness, the imam carries that on your behalf and your prayer is valid. you"
