  "transcript": "Ahmed from South Africa Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh my question is my grandmother is 80 years old and she is ill and sick with several illnesses. May Allah preserve her. She feels weak and in pain some days. Living in a Kafir country, all her doctors are Muslims to stop her from fasting the month of Ramadan. Should she go according to her strength and ability if she is able to fast or not? And if not, should we give fidya on her behalf? Jazakumullah Khairan. The ayah in Surah Al-Baqarah clearly indicates that those who are ill or traveling are exempted from fasting. And Allah also mentions that those who are able to skip Ramadan and feed a poor person for every day, they skip due to their legitimate reason such as being old. And this is a very legitimate reason to the extent that some of the companions of the Prophet Alayhis Salaam, though they were in their health and state of mind, but when you reach the age of 80, maybe even the age of 70 or less, a person could be healthy, could be able to walk and talk and still not senile, not in a state of old age that he cannot concentrate. Rather, he has his mental ability intact, but physically he cannot withstand not eating or drinking for more than four or five hours. And then he almost faints and loses his strength. This is natural. Such individuals, and your grandma probably is one of them, is at this stage. She has so multiple of illnesses and fasting would cause a real hardship if not hindering or hampering her safety and health and life. In this case, Alhamdulillah, Allah has given her the concession to skip fasting Ramadan and feed one poor person for every day missed and Allah knows best."
