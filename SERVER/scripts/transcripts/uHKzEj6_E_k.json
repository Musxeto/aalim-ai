  "transcript": "louie from canada says that he cannot skip school to go to friday prayers and his father is not cooperating with him and he doesn't know what to do well the scholars said that each man has to [Music] study and work in order to be the bread winner and this is their part of life and jumu'ah is also mandatory upon every capable muslim though if a muslim has a legitimate excuse such as traveling or being sick or a slave or a woman these are exempted from prayers therefore if a person skips friday due to a legitimate reason this is permissible so is skipping friday for university considered to be a legitimate reason the answer is yes because if he did not skip it it would impact his studies and his livelihood and so many things that may affect his future and alhamdulillah we all know that if a person eats garlic or onions he's exempted from attending the congregational uh prayer so if a person is studying he's got university he's got um school if a person is guarding his shop so someone who has merchandise and if he goes to attend the prayer he fears that his merchandise would be stolen this is a legitimate excuse to skip not only regular uh prayers but also friday prayers and this falls under this category in sha allah you"
