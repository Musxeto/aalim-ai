  "transcript": "Shuaib from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, what's the ruling on following pages of friends on social media who may post something haram occasionally meaning their feed might include halal and haram content so is it permissible to follow such accounts even if we avoid such videos and pictures that come up on our feed? Till when are you going to avoid it Shuaib? Today you managed to avoid the haram content, next week you manage to do so, next month somewhere down the line you will be caught off guard and shaytan will pull your legs to watch that content and then this is the beginning of the end. This is how shaytan works, shaytan is patient, shaytan is not rushing, he's marinating you. When you follow such friends on social media that you know that they post haram and halal material, why would I give them any recognition? I should only follow those who post halal things so that I would not tarnish and spoil my feed with such filth and this is safer for you when you lie down in your grave and when you meet Allah on the Day of Judgment."
