  "transcript": "You said you won't translate. So the brother is asking that many places in the Qur'an it talks about the hereafter and unfortunately we read the Qur'an it goes from one ear and exits from the other. So how can we increase our Iman in the hereafter? Akhi this is a question that requires a full lecture. Why? So many people that I have counseling with they come to me because I'm not a psychiatrist of course it's not free counseling it's money I take money from people because they take half an hour of my time they have to pay. Tough luck. So they come to me with their problems. I'm not a psychiatrist I'm an eye-opener and they come to me for the reason I'm a sheikh. So the first question I ask them what are the pillars of Iman? And they laugh. Ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, ash hadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa shalom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, wrong. They're shocked. Huh? What do you mean wrong? I said are you Muslim? He said yes. These are the pillars of Islam you moron. I said what is the pillars of Iman? I never heard of it sheikh. He said subhanallah. Without believing in the six pillars of Iman, you're not a Muslim. To believe in Allah and the day of judgment, to believe in the angels, to believe in the messengers, to believe in the scriptures, to believe in whether good or bad. And each one of these six pillars constitute your happiness in this world. If you have full Iman. The vast majority of Muslims don't even know. All what they know is Salah, Saum. Even Zakat they don't know. Some people I speak to them, I said, I have knowledge. I'm a doctor. I am a professor. I I said do you know that Zakat can be 2.5 percent? He said yeah of course. And five percent? What? And ten percent? Come on. And twenty percent? So you're crazy sheikh. You don't have knowledge. You didn't study Fiqh. This is why you don't know. So most people when it comes to the six pillars of Iman, they have zero knowledge. And to believe in Allah. What does this include? To know Allah's beautiful names and attributes. To know the worship of Allah. The lordship. People don't know the difference. If you ask people, mashallah you're Muslims? Said yes. How many names of Allah are there? 99. No there are more. But we will assume that the hadith 99 names, 100 minus one. Whoever calculates them, he will enter Jannah. How many names of Allah do you know? Maybe 20. Liar. You don't know 20. Right. He said okay 10. Okay good. Thank you. From the 10, how many of these names you know the meaning? Oh no sheikh. I don't speak Arabic. So we have a problem. And this is why when you start to pray, you say Allahu Akbar. You don't know who you're praying to. But if you knew Allah's beautiful names and attributes, when you say Allahu Akbar, you feel the sweetness of Salat. You feel the connection between you and Allah. You don't see anything even if a cat comes. You will not feel it. You will be focused on Salat. So to know the day of judgment includes, number one, the signs of the day of judgment. Minor and major. Includes what will happen in the grave. Includes resurrection for includes when everybody is gathered. Includes of the day of judgment. Includes walking on the straight path, which is a bridge over Jahannam. And people fall, and people crawl, and people walk, and people run. It includes the pool of the prophet. May Allah grant you and me a drink from it. So it includes heaven and hell. If you don't have knowledge in this, when I came to Indonesia, they said, you're going to go to Punjab. I said, Punjab? This is like pancake. What is Punjab? I had to Google it. I said, oh, okay, very nice. You're going to Jannah. Do you know what's in Jannah? Oh no, Sheikh, but I know it's free. You don't have to pay anything. No credit card. You have to know what's happening. So in order to increase your Iman of the day of judgment, you have to learn and read Tafseer. One of the greatest books in Arabic that I have learned and benefited a lot, I think it's translated into English. It's for Sheikh Omar Ibn Sulaiman Al-Ashqar. He died on the 27th of Ramadan, SubhanAllah, maybe 15 years ago or 10 years ago. He was one of the great scholars of Islam. He wrote a number of books about these pillars of Iman. If you go and buy the minor signs of day of judgment, major signs, heaven and hell, you will find, inshallah, a lot of benefit from that."
