  "title": "Is it true that most women will be in HELL? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "akbar says is it true that the number of women in hell will be greater than men and that the reason behind this is not the greater over all population of women compared to men but the greater sins of women than men as far as the majority of the people of hell fire this is true the prophet alaihis said in an authentic hadith o women folk give a lot in charity because i've seen you the majority of the people of hellfire and he explained that the vast majority of the women are in hell due to one of their major sins which is being ungrateful to their husbands expressing their ingratitude not being appreciative of whatever their husbands do to them and this is why they are the vast majority of the people of hell however this doesn't mean that they are a minority in paradise which is an issue of dispute but a number of companions used to consider that the women are also the majority of the people of paradise either because in population the number of women is usually greater than the number of men this is why on earth a man can marry up to four women this is why we see in front of us that the demand for women is far less than the supply of women so if i were to get married i have a whole range to choose from but it's not the other way around because the amount of women is greater than the amount of men and the prophet told us at the end of time a man would be the guardian the custodian the safe keeper of 50 women 5-0 which means that the men are less in number men die much more than women due to wars to accidents and people get more girls than boys of their offspring this is how allah azza made things to be so some of the companions such as etc say that every man has two women in paradise which means that they think that the women are the majority whether they are humans or including the and this is in allah's knowledge"
