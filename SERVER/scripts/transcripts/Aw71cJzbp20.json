  "transcript": "hey from pakistan yes my friend what can i do for you sheikh my question is yes share my question is what is the meaning of manhattan there are some guys who say that you have to learn the manhattan at any cost even if you pray and maybe your is correct uh like lame and muslims and even if you're doing all the good deeds staying away from sins but uh you have to learn the manhattan like what was the mantra of the south africa in politics and what was the manager of the south of in faith so what is the term is it important to learn it okay i will answer you inshallah finally says what is the meaning of manhattan this question is takes a while to talk about and i've addressed it in many videos before manhattan is not a word used by uh um yeah any regularly it's contemporary used to divide the ummah especially among the super super salafis who claim that the man hatch is very important so even if you're a salafi with a salafi with a salafi practice of the deen but you don't follow their samaha their allama their you don't follow their methodology and way of thinking of making the muslim ruler to be in a semi-god position to that extent they sometimes exaggerate it and anyone who says anything even to criticize a regulation or a munkar oh he's a hawari what is this and they're very good in labeling people by name oh this sheikh he is this is this this is that these are the people who only focus on manhattan they don't focus on quran and sunnah and following the salaf and abiding by the sunnah they don't only tell you to follow shuffling if etc no no no no they have more than that they have a hidden agenda so anyone who emphasizes on the issue of man has dropped them focus on learning the proper akida with the understanding of the self and not going into extreme and labeling people and picking and choosing among the dua and backbiting them and said no it's not backbiting this is it's okay it's permissible whatever they say they can find a way out for it all of this is not part of the methodology and the way of social knows best you"
