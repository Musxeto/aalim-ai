  "title": "Following Culture Over Islam",
  "transcript": "The elders want people to bow to them or squat to them. And if you don't do this, they consider this a sign of disrespect. Subhanallah. What religion do these people follow? They say, no, no, no, this is cultural. You have to bow. You have to squat. No, no, this is not part of Islam. Even if it's your culture, Islam comes first. If you're a true Muslim, if you're not and you prefer your culture over Islam, then on the Day of Judgment, you know where you will be, In Sha Allah. As a Muslim, I have to tailor-make my life according to Islam, not the other way around. Islam is to be followed and not to follow. So we follow what Islam says. Squatting and bowing down to the elders, if it's a cultural thing, keep it in your culture, but don't do it. It's un-Islamic. It's not permissible. This is a form of glorification for other than Allah."
