  "title": "Astronomical Calculations Or Sight the Moon by the Naked Eye? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] what is scholarly opinion on moon sighting should countries follow astronomical calculations by scientist or rely on sighting the moon by site where does the following hadith stand in this error fast when you see the new moon of Ramadan and break your fast when you see the new moon of Shah wet if clouds prevent you from seeing it complete 30 days in the month of Shaban this is an issue of dispute among scholars and Allah directed us in chapter 4 Surat Annisa when he said four antennas autumn fish a in for adieu who illa llah harassin wherever you dispute over a matter then you have to refer back to Allah and the messenger meaning to Quran into the Sunnah so what does the Quran and Sunnah say about this as you've heard in the hadith the Prophet said so little yeti he fast when you see the Crescent the new moon and break your fast at the end of the month of Ramadan when you see it when you cite the new moon or the Crescent so this is the instruction of the prophet alayhi salatu salam he clearly directed us to visually see it so this means that the calculations of people who work in astronomy when they say that the new moon is born on that particular day and impossible to be born on that day should we believe them or to witnesses who come and say we visually saw it the most authentic opinion is that Islam is a religion of simplicity and we have to rely on something that is visual so even if I use a telescope and I sight the moon and I see it it's okay because I saw it with my own eyes but to claim that according to calculations today the new the new moon is born and I look and it's all cloudy it's dusty there's a storm there's no possible way to visually sight the moon should I fast tomorrow or skip it and consider it to be a day of not fasting the answer is calculation is disregarded in order to prove the crime of adultery and fornication we need a confession from the sinner the adulteress or the fornicator or we need for male Muslim witnesses testifying of seeing the actual act of penetration and describing it this is the Sharia law that was at the time of the Prophet Elisha and will remain until the day of judgment if someone comes and says check we have three cameras we have five cameras HD hi-def 16k or whatever they did numbers they have maybe they did not reach 16 I don't know so we have the footage is this sufficient the answer is no they have there has to be four male Muslim witnesses visualizing it so this is the Sharia law it is not something that we make up or we think that oh okay we have DNA testing this is enough no it's not enough it can be circumstantial evidences that a judge may use but it is not sufficient on its own therefore it that sighting has to be done now the 1 million created in our question do we have one sighting for the whole world of the Muslims or there are various sightings according to the region the most authentic opinion and this is what was done at the time of the companions may allah be pleased with them and referred to the prophet alayhi salaatu sir that each region has its own sighting a man came from a sham which is nowadays Syria from Damascus where the halifa Wow Yemen a visa fee on was there he came after the month of Ramadan entered when he reached Mecca or Medina even Abbas ask them when did you see the Crescent and he said Saturday so I mean I best said we saw it on Sunday so the man asked should we unify should you also consider Ramadan beginning at Saturday he said no the Sunnah of the Prophet our East a lot o Salam to apply and implement each one's own sighting and this is what's being practiced today people in India Bangladesh Pakistan they have their own sighting people in the Gulf area in the Arabian Peninsula have their own sighting people in Egypt have their own sighting people in Morocco people in Europe people in USA have their own sighting one says aji but this divides the Ummah when their raid is on Saturday mining it isn't Sunday there it is on a Monday the Ummah is divided okay this is not true this does not divide the ummah when they pray fetcher do I pray father at the same time say no there are three hours difference when I pray father do they pray fetcher in ush no there's eight hours difference so where is the division of the Ummah he says okay gotcha on hatch Arafah is on a Wednesday so should Muslims in America fast on Wednesday as well the answer's no said excuse me I said the answer is no read my lips Wednesday is the ninth of the ledger in Saudi Arabia in Mecca we sighted the Crescent the moon and we know that it's a Wednesday now you guys in America or in India your Arafah is the ninth of the ledger which means that you have to sight the moon in the beginning of the month so if it coincides with our sighting alhamdulillah it's Wednesday but if it's an earlier date or a later date then it might be choosing it might be Thursday sure but it's Arafah it's not Arafah that geez stand in the amount of our fat except to those who are in Saudi Arabia but for you guys in America it's the ninth of the Haeju it's not the day of Arafah the night of the nature depends on when you see the newborn moon not like ours [Music] [Applause]"
