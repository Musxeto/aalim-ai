  "title": "Parents forcing me to become a Woman Judge, is this Kufr",
  "transcript": "Shimona from Bangladesh Okay, so basically speaking, it is not permissible to study and to work as a judge with man-made laws. Because if you look at Chapter 5, Surah Al-Ma'idah, verse 44, 45 and 47, they all speak about whoever rules with other than Allah's law, then he is a Kafir, he is a Zhalim, he is a Fasiq. So the most authentic opinion is that it is not permissible at all to legislate laws that go against Islam and Shari'ah, and legislating such laws would take a person out of the fold of Islam. Anything with such laws depends on the intention. If he thinks that it is equivalent to Islam, Shari'ah or better, he is a Kafir. If he thinks that Islam, Shari'ah is better, but he is doing it because he wants worldly gain, then he is a Zhalim. And if he is doing it out of his sheer ignorance, not knowing what is right and what is wrong, then he is a Fasiq. So for you to work as a woman judge, this is totally prohibited. And if they scold you and admonish you and want you to forcefully study it, go to the university and fail. There's nothing big about it. One or two semesters and you fail, they'll know that you're not cut for it and they will change it into something else. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
