  "title": "A woman marries a non-Muslim, we know she is a Zani, but are her kids MUSLIM or KAFIR by default?",
  "transcript": "The second question is about a woman who marries a non-Muslim. We know she is a zani, she's a fornicator. The marriage is invalid, but are the kids Muslim or disbelievers by default? The rule of thumb among scholars is that the child follows the most honorable of the two religions. So if we have Christianity and Islam, by default, whether the father or the mother are a Muslim, then the child follows Islam, because it is the most honorable of the two religions. And hence, if a woman marries a non-Muslim man, regardless of his religion, and the children are born, definitely they're born out of wedlock, because the marriage is invalid. But they are still considered to be Muslims and treated as Muslims, and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best. is accepted, your phone number or your wali's, if you are a female, is shared.
