  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the US I \nhave a question regarding   tamsi' and tahamid during prayer when to say so al tasmi' is saying [ __ ] when \nrising from and al tahmid is saying when to say it tasmi' is to be said while rising \nfrom rukuu so I'm in the rukuu when I Rise I say   [ __ ] I do not do like some imams do they \nfully rise until they're erect and then they   say [ __ ] so that their microphone would \nbe adjacent to their mouth this is wrong   because this has to be done when \nmoving not when reaching the position   and of course [ __ ] can only be said when you're \nerect because there isn't except one maybe one   and a half second between rising up from the \nrecord and standing position as for the follower   this is problematic because once they are \nin the rukuu position and the Imam says a lot of the Muslims the moment they \nsay they hear [ __ ] they rise up   which is wrong the follower must not move \nuntil the Imam is or has reached the position   he is going to so if he's standing after rukuu \nand he's falling to sujud he says [ __ ] you   should not bend your back until his forehead \ntouches the ground only then you can move   regardless whether he said Allahu Akbar early or \nlate this is the Sunnah this is what the sahaba   used to do they would not bend their back \nuntil the forehead of the Prophet (Peace and   Blessings Upon him) reached the ground now \nin big Masjid you have no choice of knowing   whether the Imam has reached the ground or not \nor whether the Imam has stood direct or not so   once he finishes this is when you move and you say \nwhile moving and I hope this answers your question and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
