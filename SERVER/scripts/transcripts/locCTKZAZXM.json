  "transcript": "whoever makes a recommendation for his brother and accepts a gift offered by him has entered in one of the largest guests of riba is this involved broccoli as well okay i will answer russia from sri lanka is asking about a famous hadith the prophet said alai salazar whoever intercedes for his brother and accepts from his brother a gift then he has accepted a chapter or a division of riba now let us understand intercession is not a job it's not an occupation it's a favor so one friend of mine comes and says sheikh asim you know the ceo of this company and i'm desperately in need of a job so can you give put up a word for us so i said no problem i called the ceo is it yeah sure send me a cv send me his qualifications in couple of days and the guy is hired masha allah so the guy comes in with a montblanc pen and he says here you go if i accept this gift the prophet says that alas this would be accepting a type or a division of riba why it's a gift it's a gift given on an intercession that did not require any work from you that you did not ask for a price before doing it and hence this is not permissible commission is different if i know that you have a land a property a plot a house to sell and i work to sell it to someone and the norm is that if i manage to bring you someone to purchase it and he does then i get 2.5 of the value of this transaction and usually it's the buyer who gives it gives it to us this is totally permissible if someone tells me i have these perfumes i'd like to sell and i say okay but i'll take five percent 10 20 commission no problem in that and this is different from the hadith and allah azza knows best"
