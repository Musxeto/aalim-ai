  "title": "Saw how to do Ghusl on a video, worried are my past prayers & Ghusl valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Malaysia Muhammad Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam So basically my question is I stumbled upon a video on how to do ghusl So I realized all this time I'm not sure if I did correctly clean my ears or my nose on my last ghusl So my ghusl before this I did make sure to have my niyat and I did make sure that the water spread throughout my whole body parts I tried to make it perfect So it's just now that it came to my attention that I didn't do the way the video demonstrated on how to clean the ear or the nose So does my ghusl valid before this and will my praise and ibadah all this time counted? JazakAllah First of all you do not learn your religion from videos or from TikTok This is definitely a no-go People with big beards who come on videos Having a big beard does not qualify them to give teachings to people Especially when you don't know who these people are Fidel Castro has a very big beard and a Havana cigar Does this qualify him to give you tutorials on how to make ghusl and wudu? Of course not So you don't learn your religion except from trusted people Secondly when you performed ghusl and you've been performing ghusl all of your life All of a sudden you discover that you were making a mistake or shaytan casts doubts into your head This is not logical Your last ghusl when you made it you left the bathroom thinking that you've done everything correct This is the fact Any doubts that come afterwards ignore them Now next time you do ghusl you have to verify whether cleaning your nose and your ears were done correctly or not And I don't know what mistakes you could do Cleaning your nose is like what you do in wudu You try to get the water up your nostrils to the best of your ability and blow it out Washing your ears without getting the water into your ear canal Rather washing the inside and the outside This is ghusl This is what everybody does So I don't know what is happening to you but you should definitely learn how to do ghusl and wudu properly from the sunnah not from Tom, Dick or Harry"
