  "transcript": "what's the ruling on praying salah salat al-hajjah is quite famous and known in many countries in the arab world and the muslim world and when you trace the origin of it you find that the hadiths backing it up either are totally fabricated with a format that is not found anywhere in other forms of worship such as reciting the fact he has seven times in sujud and this is totally prohibited as that the prophet islam prohibited me from reciting the quran institute and the other hadiths are very very weak and not authentic according to the vast majority of scholars of islam and hence as muslims we cannot worship allah azzawajal get closer to him with any form of worship except something that is authenticated by the scholars something that is reference to the quran or to the sahih sunna if it's neither in this case we cannot implement it or use it you"
