  "title": "We shouldn't go out with women who don't wear hijab, but how proper must it be?",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. We have Medina from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So you said we cannot go out with a woman that don't wear the hijab. And my question is how proper does the hijab need to be? Because for example, once I was in a mosque and an auntie asked me to drink something with her outside. But the thing is, for example, she didn't have a long dress. So I'm not sure if that would be the proper hijab. First of all, when we say that it is not permissible for a hijabi woman to go out in public with a non-hijabi woman, we don't say this because in a sense that it is haram. We say this because it is something that would not add any value to the hijabi. It would probably tarnish her reputation for associating herself with a mutabarrija or a woman who is un-hijabi. Thirdly, it would endorse the sin of the non-hijabi as if it is something normal to be with and to hang out with and to accept her sin. Open sin like that. Not that it is a sinful act in the sense that you will be sinning for doing this because non-hijabis are everywhere. But we say that it is inappropriate for someone who is abiding by the sunnah, who is showing her pride in the religion of Allah to be associated with such people. Therefore, going out of the masjid with a hijabi old auntie who is not wearing the proper hijab, maybe wearing a shirwal kameez and maybe just covering her hair or putting something on her hair, this is totally permissible inshaAllah."
