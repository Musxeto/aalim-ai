  "transcript": "and we have uh nishan from sri lanka okay i wanna know the correct definition for kufur and shirak and the difference between kufrinshire and uh i know that allah will forgive whatever the sins if he pleases except shirik so will he forgive a kafir that's my question okay i will answer you inshallah nishan from sri lanka was asking what's the difference between kufr and shirk and we know that allah mentioned in two verses of surat and nisa chapter 4 that he forgives everything to whom he wishes except shirk so does this mean that kufur can also be forgiven the answer is no see shirk and kufur are interlinked every calf every mushrik is a kafir but not every kafir is a mushrik a mushrik is someone who associates others others with allah so he worships he acknowledges the existence of allah and he worships allah and someone else idols people in their graves awliya so he's a mushrik a kafir is a mushrik but he can be even worse when he says that he's an atheist or a pagan or no not a pagan he's an atheist or someone who does not believe in the existence of allah so he's worse than a mushrik because a mushrik says i acknowledge allah exists but this one says i don't acknowledge that allah exists at all so the big umbrella is kufur underneath it you would find someone who does not believe in the existence of allah you would find someone who's associating others with allah you would find hypocrites who claim to be muslims but inside they plot to destroy islam and to attack the muslims so definitely a kafir a disbeliever anyone who does not believe in islam is worse than a mushrik and he would not be forgiven and allah azzawajal knows best"
