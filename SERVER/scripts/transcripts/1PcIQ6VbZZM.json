  "title": "Extreme OCD   Wiped a puddle & later found it was impure water, is everything Najis?",
  "transcript": "uh brother faujan from Indonesia if I what if I wipe a puddle on the floor and after three hours I found out the puddle was an impure water I'm pretty sure the notice surely has spread because after I wet that impure water my feet were still wet from that water and I went to my room into my bed some of the family members also stepped on that impure wet floor so my question is should I purify large area in my house including my bed sheets this is a hypothetical question that people with OCD usually generate so they make it also almost impossible that everything in the house is contaminated by now so the only thing for the Sheikh to give fatwa is burn the whole house and reconstruct it from scratch that's the easiest way to do it it's not logical now we have a ruling that is certainty is not affected by doubt if you're certain that this puddle is nudges and that your feet are nudges and that you walked across the house I would say the places that left traces of such liquid would be an edges but this is not coronavirus that would spread all over the place this is not acid that would penetrate the floors and the carpets and everywhere else rather where you see traces of najasa this is not just wash it off if you don't see then it's clean so Sheikh I walked to my bed to walk with wet feet two steps then it's dry even if you climb to your bed there won't be any traces of najasa because your feet are dry now no shake my feet had some moisture in it do you see any impurity on your bed sheets no Sheikh then it's pure maybe it dried ah Maybe maybe is doubt we can only Implement and apply certainty and this is something that most OCD people don't want to uh swallow they just simply want to someone to say to them everything is not just you have to burn the whole house and you have to do drastic measures that are not possible which would inevitably make sure leave the Deen leave Islam that's easier for you than this and Allah knows best male and make things easy for all of us face foreign"
