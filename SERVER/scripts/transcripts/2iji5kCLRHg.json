  "title": "Ruling on praying in a masjid that has a grave | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "say it from Maghrib says that what is the ruling on praying in a masjid that has a grave in it it's either one of two options either there was a grave of a dead person they built Masjid on top of it prayer in it is totally prohibited and this message has to be demolished of course not by you and me by the authorities because this Masjid is totally prohibited to prayin or the message it was originally built and then the grave was inserted into it so if the grave was or is in within the walls of the message whether at the back front right or left this doesn't make any difference according to the most authentic opinion and you must not pray in there and the grave must be taken out and placed with the Muslim cemeteries therefore and this is unfortunately present in a lot of the so-called Muslim countries I've been to a lot of them and they have graves of auliah Abraha and all of this is totally prohibited and not permissible do not pray there"
