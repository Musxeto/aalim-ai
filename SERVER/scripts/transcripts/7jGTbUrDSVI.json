  "title": "Depriving an heir from Inheritance | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay Abu burrows third question was can a father or a mother or any person deprive in a will after his death one of his heirs can a husband say okay when I die my allah says in the quran that my wife must have 1/8 of my wealth because i have children but i what would like to deprive her from any of that she has no share in the house she has no share in the farms she must not get anything from my bank account this is invalid and such a will is sinful and the moment he dies you just stir it and throw it away because the distribution of wealth was done by Allah Himself not by anyone else and this is why allah says in surah an-nisa chapter number 4 that your parents and your your offspring you do not know who is more beneficial to you and Allah is all-knowing all knowledgeable so this is totally prohibited no one can deprive his heirs from inheriting no father can come and say my daughter is disobedient I decree that she has nothing of my wealth or this house can be distributed among my sons my daughters would not get anything this is nonsense you just die and will throw it in the dustbin and it is it has no value none whatsoever"
