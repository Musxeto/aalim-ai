  "transcript": "uh from India hello I have a question can I ask so why do people come to my show okay okay sorry I forgot h a sister has two children born out of bedlock from a non-muslim man can this man be titled as their father in all identity documents of children first of all I have to apologize for my um bluntness which some call it rudness a lot of the time people call me on my mobile and you know that my mobile is always on and I answer calls there for free but they come and sayam alaykum can I ask you a question why do you think I'm answering you you called me to ask a question I picked up to answer you so please forgive me but go straight to the question so that we would save a lot of time again coming back to's question a woman has a child out of wedlock and the father is a cafir should he be called after his father and in in in legal documents or not this is a long topic I and an issue of dispute and I would recommend that you go to the mutis in your country why is there is an issue of dispute because the Hadith when and disputed over a son over a child and that child was acclaimed by the brother of s who before dying said to his brother this is my son I fornicated with his mom and he's mine while says that my father's concubine conceived this child when she was under my father and he's my brother so the prophet said a the child belongs to the owner of the bed and the fornicator gets nothing but the stone meaning he goes empty-handed so the scholars said that the the son the child cannot be attributed to the fornicator While others said if the woman had a husband then yes by default it belongs to the owner of the bed who is the husband but if the woman was not married and what was not known to be a prostitute having many men uh uh customers in this case biologically this is the child's father and logically he can be attributed to him and Allah Asel Knows Best"
