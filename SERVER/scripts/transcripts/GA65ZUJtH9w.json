  "transcript": "Barakallahu Fikum Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh, Terima Kasih So I will assume that I understood what he said But if Sheikh Zalla Khair explains it to me that there are sects and cults that are involved in Bid'ah So where is the freedom of speech when we want to denounce their Bid'ah? And is this the right thing? Okay, first of all, Allah Azza Wa Jal says in the Qur'an What is Hikmah? Wisdom And Maw'idah Al-Hasana? Fair Preaching So if I see someone doing Bid'ah, should I put him on the ground and start jumping on his stomach? Is this logical? If you're doing Bid'ah and I come to you and say, what is this? You're in hell You are doomed in hell, you are ignorant imbecile Will you accept from me? You will not accept There is an art, Dawah is an art It's diplomacy, it's wisdom So first of all, it's a very, very important issue for the youth, especially the youth Why? Because the youth are very young So what Sheikh? Youth, young, of course We understand this No, no, no, you did not get what I meant The youth, like they say, I'm hot-blooded, baby can't you see I have this fever of 103 So I'm hot-blooded, you know, I just want to kill people, I want to destroy, I want to do something Why? This is the youth, they can't control themselves No, number one, you have to control yourself Because in Islam, we judge things by the consequence What do you mean? If I do this, what will happen? This and this, or this and this Okay, then I have to do whatever is good Because when my actions lead to good, I do it When my actions lead to harm, I refrain Like the ayah, do not insult the idols they worship so that they would not insult Allah Azza wa Jal So I will stop So I have to look When I see bid'ah, some people make it their role in life like a fly You know fly? They fall on food, on waste, on dirt, on garbage So whenever they see it, bid'ah haram, bid'ah haram, bid'ah haram, bid'ah haram, haram, haram Nobody will accept this from you People have to love you Have to respect you Have to know that you want good for them Then they will accept Some of the youth, the moment they are guided to Islam And they start practicing sunnah, mashallah, tabarakallah They start to grow the beard, the thobe goes short They put the muswak in, very good It's only five days And they start controlling Abba, this is not good, haram, you're doing kufr, you'll go to hell Mother, what are you doing, this is not appropriate, you have to wear the hijab You should not sit with my uncles, you should not listen to music My sister, my brother How will they treat him? Get out of the house, go somewhere It's your mistake Because you don't have knowledge, you don't have diplomacy You have to know the consequence If I do this, what will happen? Big problem, stop Little problem, mmm No problem, bismillah, go ahead So now we come to the people who do innovation It is not my role to criticize Oh jama'a X, they're innovative Jama'a Y, they're very bad Jama'a W is this And I just pick and choose Who's right? Only me I'm the only one who's on the sunnah Everybody else is in hellfire This is wrong Secondly, what was the way of the Prophet? The way of the Prophet was to give Islam To show people what Islam is Not to attack others So you, following the sunnah Following the Quran and sunnah With the understanding of the three favorite generations Teach the people this Instead of attacking this jama'a, this group This people, this mawlana, this No, no, don't attack Just present Islam as it is In the meantime, yes, we say For example, we go and pray in fajr in the masjid This is a new bid'ah Now everybody's looking A new bid'ah, every day after fajr, salah and dhikr People make sajdah What is this? It's sajdah shukr Every day? Yes, Allah has given me so much This is bid'ah When you say this, he looks at you He's Wahabi from Saudi Subhanallah Did the Prophet do this sajdah? No Did the companions do this sajdah? No So do you know more than them? He said, no, no, this is sajdah for Allah, not for you This is bid'ah So you have to have diplomacy You have to know how to speak to them It's not very easy I hesitate three, four times before I speak to someone Because I know how he will feel against me But I see him I said, assalamualaikum Immediately he looks Waalaikumussalam How are you? Alhamdulillah, what do you want? I said, akhi, I find, mashallah, you always pray in the first row in the masjid Mashallah, I love you for the sake of Allah Very little people pray fajr in the first row Now he is Ok, thank you Yes Mashallah, you make dhikr very good Mashallah, people don't make dhikr Now his guard is down He is comfortable with me And he said, but I'd like to ask you one question But please, please, don't be angry with me I'm like your younger brother He said, younger brother, you're 50 years older than me What younger brother? He said, akhi, this sajdah you're doing I know in the fiqh book There are two sajdahs Sajdah tilawah When I recite the Quran And sajdah shukur He said, yes Sajdah shukur, the Prophet did, alayhi salatu wasalam, once in a lifetime When they told him that the army has won He made sajdah But what if my wife cooks good nasi goreng and ding ding and rangdang So, should I make sajdah shukur? He said, no, she does this every week Then, what you're doing after fajr is not from the sunnah Maalish, please forgive me Wallahi, 99.99% Dua And they stop It is shaitan who's making us, you know, hesitate and be afraid But not everyone I have to go and say, akhi, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this You have to be diplomatic And you have to present the deen of Allah azza wa jal Instead of criticizing people I don't know if this answers your question Do you want it in Bahasa? Inshallah, the translation with the sheikh You"
