  "transcript": "So, we have to support the Aqeedah of Al-Wala Wa Al-Bara'a. This is an essential part of our religion. What is Al-Wala Wa Al-Bara'a? Al-Wala is loyalty. So, he is my Muslim brother, I'm loyal to him. But he is from a different country and he doesn't speak Arabic. No problem. He is Muslim. He is my brother. And this one, he is Christian but he is an Arab and he is neighbor to me. No, he is not my brother. My brotherhood with you is Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah wa ash-hadu an muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh and our allegiance to the Qur'an, to Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. This is our brotherhood. So, we have to revive this loyalty and to also disavow those who do not relate to our Aqeedah and show them that we have this brotherhood in Islam. Allah Azza Wa Jal says in the Qur'an, there has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibrahim Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam and those with him. When they said to their people, indeed. Now, their people is what? Is mushrik, kuffar. So, they said to their own people, Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone. This is what we have to have in our religion. You're a Muslim, you are my dear brother. I don't like you but you're my brother. I will support you. I will help you. I will stand next to you in Salah, toe to toe, shoulder to shoulder and we will eat from the same food. I will help you but if you are not a Muslim or if you are a openly sinner, I cannot have this friendship and closeness with you."
