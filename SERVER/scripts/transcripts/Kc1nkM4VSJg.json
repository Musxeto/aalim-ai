  "title": "Does a manâ€™s Non-Muslim children  have any right in his inheritance? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the uk he says that um a clarification of a question he posted yesterday that the deceased a person who died did not write a will to give something to his non-muslim children he has muslim children so we know that one-third of your will you can do do you donate and give away in your will to anyone who is not a heir who's not inheriting so he said that he did not write a will okay if he did not write a will and he did not verbally say it in front of two male witnesses then they cannot take a penny out of it except in one case when all the other heirs decide to do that willingly meaning the deceased widow the muslim children his parents if they are alive they are all heirs and they have a portion of the will if they willingly say and come up front and say no we are willing to give one third of our share to our beloved deceased departed uh man non-muslims uh children this is permissible but this won't be a will this would be a gift so whether they give half of it they will give the whole thing they would give one percent this is up to them but it is not part of the will"
