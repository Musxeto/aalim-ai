  "title": "Is there any difference between a woman's prayer and a man's? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "second question is from lily and she says I am a woman and I have been resting my forearms on the ground upon every sujood and I'm aware that there are differences in the performance of salat between men and women worshipers could you tell us further such differences first of all Lily this is an issue of dispute among scholars when you scrutinize it when you look deep into it and research it you find that the prophet Ali salatu salam clearly said pray as you have seen me pray so the hadith is general for men and for women and if you search further you would not find any authentic hadith differentiating between the way a man prays and a woman's prayer which means that in order for me to build an allegation I need evidence so when someone says if a woman were to pray in the presence of nan Muharram men as in the case of a woman who wants to pray on the pavement in the streets it's time for prayer and there's no Masjid in her home is far away what would she do she has to pray and she is fully covered so we get people coming and saying oh if she's gonna pray then she has to conceal herself in the sense that instead of making sujood like this or ruk or she has to conceal herself put her forearms on the ground as the Prophet had prohibited alayhi salatu salam and he told us that this is simulating the way of a dog or a beast when they sit and this is not permissible you have to keep your arms you have to raise elbows away from your body so some scholars say no no she does she must not do this she will be exposed and this is not true the Prophet Allison son had never warned us from this and this is a bit too extreme it is too extreme as we see in some messages when you have the women prayer area totally segregated with a wall they cannot see the worshippers and they cannot see the Imam so that they could follow and so many times the microphones go off and they are lost they cannot follow the mm they don't know what to do this wasn't at the time of the prophet Isaiah and this is not the right thing to do nevertheless sometimes we are too protective to the extent that we are more Roman than the Romans if this is unacceptable the religion of Allah is intact is fixed no need for you to come and change it so no need for you to claim that you worry about women more than the prophet Isaiah the prophet did not ever tell us that insalata certain that a woman should do this or do that when she prays in front of nan Merriman therefore the conclusion of the answer there is no evidence to differentiate the prayer of women from the prayer of men and they're identical and they have to do this whether in the presence of men or not"
