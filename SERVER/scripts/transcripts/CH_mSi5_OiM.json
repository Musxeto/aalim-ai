  "title": "If a woman, dog, or donkey passes in front of me, does it INVALIDATE my prayer? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh arik from bangladesh um sheikh my question is um uh in the book of hadith i found that while i'm praying and if a woman is passing in front of me my prayer would be invalid is this true the hadith you're referring to was narrated by um by a great number of companions if i recollect remember correctly and the hadith goes whomever is praying and a woman a dog or a donkey pass in front of him then this invalidates his prayer pass in front of him or her so even if a woman was praying and another woman passes in front of her invading and trespassing her jurisdiction between her feet and her bowing position on the ground which is approximately less than a meter if these three mentioned intercept this uh vicinity or the the area this uh invalidates the prayer mother is pleased with her did not hear the hadith and she objected and she says may allah forgive you you made us like the dogs and the donkeys and she did not believe that who narrated the hadith was correct in it and that's her understanding but with all due respect her understanding goes against understanding of the other great companions that i've mentioned earlier and this is the most authentic opinion that the passing of a woman if you're not praying to a visor to a sutra you know what a sutra is is something like a foot high or more that a person places in front of him so when he prostrates it's right in front of him and people can walk beyond it without any problem so even if a woman passes if i have this in front of me this is this acts like a sutra so if i'm prostrating and someone passes from beyond this has no impact on my prayer my prayer is valid whether it's a woman a dog or a donkey and if i don't have this and those who pass pass beyond that point then this has no uh impact on the prayer insha'allahu b you"
