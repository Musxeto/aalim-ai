  "title": "Hadith: Followers that will strictly follow laws of Allah until Qiyyamah; in Sham | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh regarding a hadith uh many people are misquoting these hadees said rasulullah said a group of my followers will keep on following allah's law strictly and they will be not be harmed until that qiyamah and moabia allahu said they are in shang are these groups are scholars or any kind of it's my question okay i will answer inshallah shah rush says there is a hadith where the prophet allah is stated that there will remain a faction of my ummah on the truth and they do not care whoever opposes them or has enmity against them and they will remain upon truth until the day of judgment and they are in hashem explained that so he says is this hadith authentic the hadith is authentic the interpretation of muawiyah at the time was probably according to his time but it is not or the other interpretation that this would happen at the end of time where mecca and medina would be deserted and all the people would go to a sham and the jail would come and a7 would descend and he would kill the jail in a sham area in puts to be specific in the area of jordan syria lebanon and palestine the holy lands would be all the focal point of the armageddon the the battle between the christians and the muslims the final battle and all the things would happen in that area so maybe he was interpreting the hadith accordingly but this group of muslims throughout the time of the prophet assad till the end of time they can be anywhere you and i can be among them if we abide by the quran and the sunnah if we abide by the true authentic akida and we don't compromise in a religion and we remain steadfast not shifting from one power to the other from one side to the other depending who pays more or who is victorious over the other they remain steadfast on the path of the prophet and the self of this ummah the they will definitely be among the saved and among the prevailing faction of the muslims and allah knows best"
