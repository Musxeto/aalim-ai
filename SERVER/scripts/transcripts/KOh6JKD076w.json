  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India Sheikh the is a Hadith if we that if we don't make \nDua that Allah gets angry so is it okay to make   Dua whenever we feel like or will we be sinful if \nwe don't uh feel like making if you feel lazy for   making it I uh um know that there is a statement \nby a poet that the son of Adam is angry when he's   asked and Allah is angry when he is not asked and \nthe Hadith I'm not sure if this is authentic or   not but indeed is a form of worship and if you \ndon't make Dua that this means that you feel   independent from Allah's help and guidance \nand this is definitely something serious so   do I become sinful if I don't make Dua the answer \nis yes because you've abandoned the form of of   worship that it's more important for your heart \nthan the oxygen you breathe we cannot remain idle   without asking Allah whether it's for forgiveness \nor to cast his mercy upon us or to facilitate our   daily lives I am unable to answer your question \nwithout making Dua and I make a lot of Dua   before attending this program because I don't know \nwhether I would be guided or not whether I'll make   a mistake or not I feel helpless without Allah's \nguidance to me I need Allah azzawajal whenever   I visit the doctor or whenever I go shopping or \nwhenever I do whatever I do because without his   help and guidance I'm worthless I'm nothing so yes \nyou have to make Dua to Allah feeling lazy this is   a sign of Satan controlling your mind and engaging \nyou in Trivial things and Allah Knows Best"
