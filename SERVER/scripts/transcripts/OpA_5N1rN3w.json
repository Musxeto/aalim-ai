Many of us when we've recently converted or reverted or started practicing Islam have this enthusiasm in us to call people to Islam Why? Because I said so, I'm your father, I'm your husband, I'm your boss, you do what I say And this is not very healthy nor beneficial for da'wah The way of the Prophet ﷺ was always to bring people to adhere to shari'ah law through the Qur'an, the prophetic sunnah and teachings and logic This is how the Prophet ﷺ dealt with people Nevertheless the Prophet ﷺ followed up with a justification, cover your thigh for the thigh is part of your awrah So neither his children nor his parents or anyone else can see his thigh and unfortunately a lot of the households don't adhere to this ruling Mother Aisha tells us for example, may Allah be pleased with her and with her father Abu Bakr And the Prophet ﷺ pointed to it saying, O Aisha, don't you know that the owners of such drawings are severely tormented on the day of judgement? So the Prophet ﷺ pointed out the error, the mistake, the sin and he clarified the ruling, why? Why is it haram to have little sculptures in the guest room or in the living room or in the toilet even? Little crystal dolphins, they're nice, they're cute, or some elephants from Thailand or some camels from Egypt or even worse, some pharaoh statues, Nefertiti and the likes These are statues, they prevent the angels from entering and those who made them are the most severely punished on the day of judgement as per the various numerous hadiths And angels won't enter your home when you're displaying these and you're thinking that it's okay The Prophet ﷺ again showed us the reason, not by just simply, don't do this, no, he tells us why, he justifies it So now it's fixed and attached in our heads that this is haram because so and so and so Yes there are some rulings in Islam that are not justified in the sense that we're not given the logic why or the reason But they're justifiable because Allah ordered it, that's sufficient So in things that we have the reason of, it's best to say the ruling and the reason Don't drink wine, why? Because it intoxicates you, it makes you wasted, makes you do horrible things If it's logical, so now I understand But to go around tell people don't do this or do that without any justification, this is unacceptable Especially from you and I because we're not the Prophet ﷺ and we're not people of authority So when I give da'wah to my siblings, I have to justify, I have to explain it to them Unlike when I give da'wah to my children for example, I said so because I said so, they have to comply But it would add an extra value if I were to explain the ruling for them, unfortunately Unfortunately, a lot of us fail miserably in giving da'wah in the right form So many problems between the spouses take place because the husband said something and then went blank Went off the grid and the wife is trying to speak to him and the guy is, does not exist The number you're calling cannot be reached at this time, why? This husband or this man has issues, he thinks just because he said do or do not do that everyone has to comply No questions asked and if they don't comply, they give them the silent treatment, talk to the hand Some wives complain that her husband does not speak to her for months and some for years One of the daughters sent me a message saying that her father does not speak to her mom for the past year and a half He just comes in, finds a good meal, clothes are washed and ironed and pressed, the house is clean, that's it He doesn't speak to his wife, he always does this And such individuals are a very very bad representation of Islam Especially if his in-laws are non-Muslims Akhi, you are the worst public relation representative of Islam They hate Islam because of you Some of them are gold diggers, some of them are arrogant, narcissists, ignorant Yet they think that they know everything And they want to force people to do what they say, no questions asked This is not the way of the Prophet, and this is the importance of this topic How to deal, how did the Prophet, how did he deal with mistakes, errors and sins So that we can find out and figure out if we are on the right track or we're going somewhere else The third point is, mistakes usually happen either due to following whims and desires or to a misconception Even the Khawarij, when they went over the rampage and rebelled against Ali And may Allah be pleased with him, and they wanted to start a fight And started a war, started killing people Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father Said to Ali, send me to them as your messenger And I'll debate with them Why? We could have finished this through war, annihilated them and moved on Because they had a misconception that needed to be cleared Like most people of innovation Most people of innovation have this misconception that needs to be cleared out I'm not talking about hypocrites, full-fledged hypocrites who want to dismantle Islam Like the Rafida, for example These are hypocrites, they're not people with misconceptions No, no, they hate Islam They misrepresent Islam They worship other than Allah No, I'm not talking about those I'm talking about innovators who do things thinking that they're doing the right thing They have a misconception The way of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to deal with them Was to correct their misconceptions that are due to something not being clear in people's minds A clear example, the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him When three of the companions came Checking on the forms of worship that the Prophet used to offer When he was in his home So they went and asked the wives of the Prophet, peace be upon him Because they knew the most private dealings and forms of worship of the Prophet Peace be upon him Which others were not exposed to So when they were informed They belittled it And they were shocked, only this? And they came up with a misconception Thinking that, aha, the Prophet, peace be upon him, did so little Because Allah has forgiven all of his previous and upcoming sins So he has a carte blanche Do whatever you wish That's why he's doing so little So one of them said As for me, I'll never sleep at night I'll keep on praying the whole night until Fajr Until the break of dawn The second one said As for me, I'll never ever skip a day I'll fast every single day of the year From the break of dawn till the sunset The third one said As for me, I desire women And in order to get closer to Allah I take a pledge that I will never marry a woman I'll be like a monk When the Prophet heard this, peace be upon him He was angered by it So he went to them He spoke to them And he said, are you the ones who said so and so? And he cleared for them their misconception By saying, by Allah, I'm the most knowledgeable among you of him And the most fearful among you of him So I have both the knowledge and the fear of Allah azza wa jal However, I fast and I break my fast I pray night prayers and I sleep at night And I marry women Whoever seeks other than my sunnah, other than my way Then he is not from me This is how the Prophet dealt, peace be upon him With mistakes that were based on misconceptions And today, we are in deep need of such corrections Because how we evaluate individuals How we evaluate situations Are not in accordance to Islam When we see a scholar of Islam Someone who devoted his time, life and wealth For teaching people and correcting their aqeedah And calling them to Islam Yet we see a famous footballer Even a kafir Or a pop star Or an actor Or a wealthy multi-billionaire Who will the people be drawn to And who will they give more respect to And this shows you that Life is too short And our glasses They need to be corrected and aligned With the Qur'an and the sunnah Because we are unable to see eye to eye We are unable to see the things that Allah wants us to see The way He wants us to see it Sahl al-Musa'd al-Sa'idi, may Allah be pleased with him Tells us that the Prophet, peace be upon him Was sitting with his companions When a man passed by So the Prophet asked his companions What do you say of this person? So they started praising him Oh Prophet of Allah This man is one of our dignitaries He is worthy If he were to propose to people That they accept and give him in marriage If he were to intercede They would accept his intercession And give him what he wants And if he were to speak People should listen and obey The Prophet did not say anything A while later Another man Among the poor Muslims Walked by So the Prophet said to his companions What do you say about this individual? So the companions said Oh Prophet of Allah This guy is One of the poor Muslims He is worthy If he were to propose to a family That he is rejected And if he were to intercede That his intercession would not be accepted And if he were to speak No one would pay attention or listen to him This is how the people Looked at two different individuals And this is why the Prophet said Correcting this imbalance Correcting this misconception He said this man Is better than an earth Full of men like the other man Wow Look how the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam Managed in a handful of words Change The conviction The perception And how we evaluate people And this is Unfortunate When you live in an era When you live in a time Where the number of followers Identify you Your value Is how many People following you on Instagram Or YouTube or Facebook Or whatever social media there is And this is Alarming And this shows How corrupt Societies and cultures are When they follow And adhere To hooligans To people of chaos People who are immodest People who have nothing to do With religion Rather they're against Islam And attack Islam Yet you find people following them Coating them Listening and obeying What they say While the real scholars of Islam The real people of Quran Those who follow the Aqeedah Are neglected Are frowned upon Looked down upon Insulted in many cases It shows you that This society Is going downhill Pretty quick And Allah Azza wa Jal Does not ever preserve Such a society Or a country Or an environment Whenever The people of God The people of Allah The scholars The people of virtue and righteousness The worshippers Are looked down upon And prominence And honor and respect is given To enemies of Allah Who go against Islam Who are immodest Who have nothing to add To the community or to the country This is a clear sign of A clear sign of Soon Destruction And chaos To take place Because Allah Azza wa Jal Does not favor Such a community When they Do not favor The people of Knowledge And the people of Islam We have a short break And after that we'll take Your calls So stay tuned We'll be right back"
