  "transcript": "now the name is from the UK is it as in Allah's name this is totally Haram you should change this name and never use it if it's ad if it's ad which in Arabic means uh uh leather then this is okay so excuse me you have to clarify is okay very good so it it refers to leather and this is totally permissible yes my friend what can I do for you so basically whenever I make woodo and especially at work it takes me a long time for some reason I do do it according to the Sunnah but um when I use a lot of water I do it quicker and I work I need to obviously be one minute Ino so it's they permissible for me to just make woodoo like with a lots of water it's still bad for me to use little water but take more time no of course if it is time versus extravagance I would choose more time because when you say I follow the Sunnah but I use a lot of water it can't go it's like saying I am black but I'm white it has to be one of the two the Sunnah is the prophet used to make wo from approximately less than 300 milliliters let me rephrase that uh it's a mud this is what the prophet's uh wo used to be so if you fill this and you some say it it is approximately 600 to 700 milliliters but I've tried it with a mug and it was a beautiful woodoo and the prayer was excellent afterwards the more you are inclined to follow the Sunnah by using less water and trying to just put a spoon or two uh tablespoon of water in your hand and then with that you wash your face and you consume very little water water when you pray you find that your prayer is beautifully executed so no take more time but do not waste water"
