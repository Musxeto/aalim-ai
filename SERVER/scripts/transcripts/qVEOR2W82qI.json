  "transcript": "Zacky says is using face app permissible we just use it for fun but some people are objecting to this kindly explain now the face app I don't know what that is I don't use these gadgets at hamdulillah but if I understand it correctly it's an application that takes a photo of you and then adds few years imagining that your beard would be white your skin would be wrinkled a little bit and and it puts some changes on your face so a lot of the youngsters fancied that and they posted photos of celebrities with such an app and then we've heard that this is a Russian app that is being installed on your personal phone and it has the ability to hack and say all these are not important to me what is important to me is is it Helen to change and manipulate how a person's face is to change the characteristics of a person the answer is yes this is Hallam why first of all one of the most major sins in Islam is mimicking and imitating the creation of Allah and there's so many hadith explaining this telling us that drawing a portrait of a person is one of the major sins in Islam the most tormented people on the day of judgment are those who make sculptures draw pictures of living creatures so they're mimicking those who made a portrait of person as in the rich families you find a portrait of their grandfather on the wall of a painter who just painted it the painter is one of the most severely tormented people and day of judgment those who make sculptures and statues of people again they will be tormented Allah would give life to such drawings and sculptures so that they would punish and torment that person in Hellfire so this is totally prohibited okay sure but the picture is a photograph of you so this is you this is not mimicking the creation of Allah correct and this is why we say that taking photograph is permissible because it's a reflection of how you look there's nothing extra it's like when I sign a cheque and someone Xerox is it makes a photocopy off and I see the photocopy and someone asks me whose signature is this I wouldn't say no no this is an imitation I'd say that this is though it's a Xerox copy this is my signature and likewise the reflection in the mirror is the creation of Allah and snapshot that I took of you is the picture or the creation of Allah there's no problem in that my problem is with recreating it and this is why we tell people taking a photograph is halal using Photoshop to change it is Haram when you remove some of the color of the face the wrinkles the white hair strands on the beard on the hair itself you make the person a bit slimmer or a bit chubbier now this is changing the creation of allah azzawajal and this is prohibited so the face app does this a exactly and hence it is not permissible and allah azza wajal knows best"
