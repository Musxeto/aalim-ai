  "transcript": "Our first caller for today is Sadiqah from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, in my country most of the people follow the opinion that a little amount of nutmeg is not haram and most of the food in our country contain this nutmeg. They use a spice mix called garam masala and some people put nutmeg in this spice mix, some people don't. So, I know some famous food and know the recipes like biryani, any kind of biryani or kachi tehari, chicken roast or beef curry. Usually the food we eat in the restaurant or we eat as a guest in someone's house or in special day we cook this kind of food and most of the people use nutmeg. We don't use and those who follow the opinion don't use but if I go restaurant or someone's house and I know the recipe that this recipe contain nutmeg, should I ask them if they put this or not because by testing I cannot say if they put this or not. Okay, I got your question. First of all, we've spoken about the issue of nutmeg many times and said that it's an issue of dispute among scholars and the reason for that is they all agree that a large amount of nutmeg is intoxicant but due to the fact that it has been used for so long by people in very minimal quantities in food, there is a dispute of opinion on the opinion that some scholars say using a very minute amount of it is permissible and this is done in Saudi Arabia where they allow some of the ingredients of food providing it does not exceed a specific percentage. So if people follow this opinion, there is no problem inshallah. Those who say that no it's totally prohibited whether a lot or few would refrain from doing this either way. If you go to a Muslim's house, you do not ask whether they have used nutmeg or not. If you go to Muslim restaurants and the likes, you do not because the default is that it's halal until proven otherwise and checking and asking is not from Islam and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
