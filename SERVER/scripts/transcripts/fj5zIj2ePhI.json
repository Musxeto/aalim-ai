  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh May Allah give you Barakah and Rahmah with you, Sheikh. As we know in study, knowledge, science, many of science as you mentioned it, halal and haram, and my question is, what's your opinion about philosophy? Instead of many scholars of Islam, like Muhammad Iqbal in Pakistan, or in Middle East, knowledge of mantiq as you know, is it haram or not? Okay, Allah is Seeker, JazakAllah Khair. Now the question is clear, what is the ruling on studying philosophy? Now philosophy is a dangerous science, and it is like going into the ocean when you don't know how to swim. What will happen? One of two, either you will drown, or before you drown, sharks will eat you. So philosophy is dangerous, why? Because philosophy is based on doubt. The first thing you do in philosophy is doubt who you are. Doubt the existence of Allah. Doubt this universe, then prove it. So they say the first thing you do is you doubt in order to become a believer. In Islam, this is totally haram. All the people who came to the Prophet, he didn't say to them, doubt yourself. Are you a bird? No, so you have to doubt yourself. The first thing he says, say, la ilaha illallah, no doubt. This is affirmation. There is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah Azza wa Jal. Now, having said this, 99.99% of all Muslims, it is prohibited to study philosophy. Who can study philosophy? Only scholars of Islam, like Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, for example, who has extreme high level of knowledge in Quran, in Aqidah, in Sunnah, in Hadith. Why is he studying philosophy? So that he can counter the philosophers and those who use logic. Without Aqidah, you will be the first one to suffer. And this is why Imam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, he is one of the greatest scholars of Islam. He went and studied philosophy and got lost. For 10, 15, 20 years, he was lost. He was in very bad condition until Allah guided him before he died. And he said, Alhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah, I went into the ocean without knowing how to swim. But Allah saved me. Not everyone can be saved. A lot of the people who study logic, leave Islam. Leave Quran. Start to doubt. And this is from Shaytan. So, no one to study philosophy until you are firmly strong in memorizing the Quran, in knowing Aqidah strongly, and having your arsenal. It's like coronavirus. You need to have immunity. Vaccine. One, two, three. Now, you can maybe, Inshallah. Thank you."
