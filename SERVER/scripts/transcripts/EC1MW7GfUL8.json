  "transcript": "Ahmed from the Maldives Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam wa'atullah Sheikh I am doing Ruqya on myself these days because I fear that I have evil eye or black magic so my question is me can I recite Ruqya me not loudly I mean silently okay if you recite the Ruqya while moving your lips and tongue silently this is 100% valid so if you do it by just reciting it moving your lips and tongue this is valid it's best when you do it on water before drinking you say bismillahirrahmanirrahim till the end and then and drink that's best because the impact of what you recite verbally to the water and how it impacts it with the grace of Allah and then impacts your body is noticeable and been tried before you"
