  "title": "Sending daughter alone to foreign country To pursue higher education? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "so a brother says we see many expat families in saudi arabia sending their daughters 17 years plus all alone to foreign countries like the us the uk for higher education under what conditions is this permissible they feel if they don't send them their daughters will lose out to other girls as education is really necessary in today's world first of all the biggest problem is when we do not estimate understand calculate well what is included in the equation as muslims what is our priority entering jannah as muslims are we supposed to follow our whims and desires or sharia definitely shariah as muslims is it best to fall into an illness or a disease or to take your precautions from the very beginning and avoid it nobody says let's fall in the disease and get the treatment afterwards definitely protection taking your precautions is far better than falling into the into the disease and then acquiring and seeking medication now a woman a girl what is she obliged to do where in the quran does it say she has to pursue her academic uh teachings she has to learn she has to get a degree or a master's or a phd it doesn't say that generally speaking islam focuses on women taking their role in the community and society and the most important is to take care of their homes families and children because this is the community and the society islam does not promote them being ceos or marketing managers or travelers or airline pilots or engineers islam doesn't prevent them from pursuing what they want providing it falls under the guidelines of sharia and this is the most important thing so now we go back to how to set the parameters of the problem to understand the problem when you say that a lot of the families send their girls unattended to kafir countries to pursue their studies because they don't want them to fall short or to lose out to other girls as education is important for women and for girls nowadays it's a necessity this is not true if you mean that certain men demand and require that the woman they get they are to get married to must have a bachelor degree or a master's then this is yeah true not all men demand this most men demand that a woman is righteous practicing beautiful well-behaved knows how to take care of children knows how to take care of her husband her diploma or degree is good for decoration of the wall it does not add any value to her marriage some men want a working woman who would pay and share the rent and the bills a real man doesn't accept this so a sensible woman would not look for such a suitor therefore what is happening at the moment where families are sending their girls unattended to kafir countries is a grave mistake and it indicates to you that it's a mistake that allah azza prohibited a woman from traveling alone without a male mahram accompanying her allah azza prohibited a woman to get married without approval and consent of her guardian so that her decision-making would be more logical and acceptable than when she makes it on her own there are so many things that protect women in islam and definitely sending them unattended to a kafir country where everything goes and everything is encouraged that goes against islam may help her in her studies but it would definitely jeopardize her iman her islam and it's like putting all the eggs in one basket and you know what happens when it falls down it all breaks so this is not permissible it is not part of what islam teaches a woman traveling alone is haram a woman living in a kafir country is even worse living alone in a kafir country and alhamdulillah we have muslim countries we have education that can be acquired in our own muslim countries and allah azza knows best"
