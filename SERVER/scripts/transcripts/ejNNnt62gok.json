  "transcript": "recently my grandmother passed away during this Ramadan I want Allah subhanallah to give her gender if I want to make Dua for their forgiveness is there any specific to Allah and also enlightened in irrelevant Hadith from our prophets Allah [Music] might be mentally ill but that inshallah she's not she's not I was just joking mothers-in-law please do not hold me responsible for what I say I'm fasting you know I'm not able to concentrate anyhow subhanallah may Allah have mercy on all those who have died among the Muslims and may Allah shall make their Jannah their final adult um when a person dies Allah described this in the Quran as a catastrophe as a Calamity death is not something easy and unfortunately it is the hidden truth that we fail to see people die in the tens and hundreds around us if I give you a paper and pen and ask you in the past 10 years how many people have died that you know of and you will maybe fill it up okay when will you die or not now I still have like six seven uh mansions to build and I did not buy my green card GTS four plus uh Porsche with the double turbo and I did not marry my third wife or the second wife or fourth wife and I have so many things to do not now but yes we are all going to die actually you are any bluffing you don't think you're gonna die if you're going to die you don't have this horrible things in your house TV channels satellites internet uh Facebook face hell Twitter and you're engaged in sin publicly and privately are you going to die tonight yes yes maybe but okay what are you going to do I'm going to just finish this class people still have hope so death is inevitable when it comes may Allah you'll make it easy upon all of us and make our death on shahada on the Kalima on a good deed and while we are in our full health not being tried by so many illnesses and uh problems second of all when a person dies there are things that will reach that person through the authentic Sunnah the best thing is Dua make Dua what's the best Dua oh Allah forgive my grandmother oh Allah have mercy on her o Allah expand her a grave and make it a a garden of paradise any in general of forgiveness secondly charity as in the Hadith my mother died and I think that if she didn't die she would have instructed me to give so-and-so in charity should I do it said the prophet yes do it so giving charity on the behalf of your deceased loved one is immediately accepted so you they tell you there is a well to be dug in this poor country okay I'm gonna give you the money for my grandmothers while she's in her grave the meter is running as long as the people are benefiting we want to build a Masjid we want to make an Institute for teaching there is all of this is acceptable we want to give food to the impoverished and needy people we want to build shelters we want to do this any type of Charity is accepted inshallah and it would reach them and Hajj and we call it badal on behalf of whether you yourself personally do it or pay someone to do it for you this reaches the disease without any problem with the grace of Allah now reciting Quran is not part of the Sunnah so it doesn't reach so many people remember XYZ from uh their friends read the Fatiha [Music] washing scrubbing what have you done yet what are you doing he's reading reading why in Arabia we read the Fatiha in two occasions it might be similar to some we read Fatiha when we make the marriage contract so if the marriage contracted conducted let's read the Fatiha and when someone dies and we remember him we read the Fatiha so as if marriage and death are related to some it is ask me but now to others it's there's no relation both is Buddha both is an innovation so reciting the Quran does not reach the deceased at all fasting yes if there is obligatory fast upon him whether Ramadan missed days or a an oath a vow that he made or kafarat this is also possible Knows Best"
