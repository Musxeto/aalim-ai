  "title": "Born Shia, now following Sunnah, afraid family won't allow me to pray in the masjid if they find out",
  "transcript": "We have brother Ali from Kuwait. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh, I was born into a deviant Shia family, but Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala has guided me to the true path of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah. I'm planning on telling my family about this soon, and I'm more than certain when I tell them they will prevent me from praying in the masjid. What should I do about this? Alhamdulillah Azza Wa Jal that He has guided you to the right path and saved you from being deviant and all. Now, if you are certain that they would prevent you from praying in the masjid, Akhi you're not a child and you're not a girl, so you can go out to attend school, to buy things, to do errands, you're a man. Therefore, there would be some resistance. If you deal with such resistance with wisdom, diplomacy, knowledge, and kindness, it will take some time and then it will all go away. Alhamdulillah. So don't allow shaytan to whisper in your ears that they're going to do this, they're going to do that, because this is what shaytan promises us. Promises us with poverty, with insecurity, with instability. So don't believe in that and trust Allah Azza Wa Jal and go ahead with what you're doing and Allah Azza Wa Jal would guide your way. Now, if your fear is eminent and real and genuine and your parents or your family are so hostile and abusive and can harm you physically, in this case, Alhamdulillah, and this is for sure, not something you doubt. If this is the case, then Alhamdulillah, you can hide your Islam and try your level best to be independent from them as soon as possible by separating or to be financially independent and to move on with your life where you can practice Islam freely and may Allah make you steadfast on Islam and make things easy for you. Alhamdulillah."
