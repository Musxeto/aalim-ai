  "transcript": "knowledge is of two types one is the religious knowledge and the other is worldly knowledge it is compulsory it is f that every Muslim should see to it that he gives the basic religious knowledge to his children that's his duty otherwise he'll be responsible on the day of judgment since he's the father or she's the mother it's the duty of every Muslim to see to it that to the children they give the basic knowledge of the dean number one ised the Wess of Allah subhana wa ta'ala what is the meaning ofed who is Allah subhana taala the verse S sh number two is Salah how to offer Salah the basics of it number three zakat that every each person who has a saving of more than the nisab level 85 g of gold every lunar should give 2.5% of that excess wealth in charity is a Praying minimum five times a day zakat 2.5% of excess wealth in charity know Year s fasting in the month of Ramadan in the month of Ramadan abstaining from food drink and sex from dawn to Sunset and Hajj if you have the means the health and the money at least one in a lifetime perform Hajj that is pilgrimage to the holy city of Makkah and Mina all thean at least once in a lifetime these are the basic teachings which is f every parent should give to the children and as much as you can of the Islamic knowledge the better it is but the basic is minimum far the other type of knowledge is the worldly knowledge again the worldly knowledge can be divided into two types that worldly knowledge which gets you closer to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that worldly knowledge which makes you understand the Quran and the Hadith better that worldly knowledge which makes you understand and implement the Sharia better this type of knowledge inshallah will help you in this world and the but if you seek a worldly knowledge which does not get you closer to Allah subhana wa ta'ala does not help you to understand the Quran better does not help you to implement the Sharia better this knowledge may or may not be useful in this world but in the it will be useless and today we find that we look up to the Western Society for education and most most of the people today think Muslims and non-muslims both that the best profession is that of a doctor medical doctor most of the people think even being a medical doctor depending upon how you put that knowledge to practice if by acquiring that knowledge you're saving the lives of hundreds and thousands of human that's good but if you're using that knowledge for example to do abortion to save the people who have done Zena fornication adultery and hide their sin then this knowledge is not good so every knowledge you acquire it also depends upon how you utilize it how do you implement it for the good or for the bad so knowledges can be used in two ways for good things and for bad things if you use for good things it'll be good for you if not it will have negative impact on you as I was saying that most of the people are impressed by the Western knowledge if you analyze I do agree that the Western knowledge in terms of science and technology it is improving but where it come where it comes to morality to modesty sobri it declining and when we read this Western education when you take Knowledge from the Western education what will they tell you they will tell you and you find that not in Western Country it's even now coming to the Eastern country it says condom yourself that means when you're having sex condom mean no problem you can have ilicit sex you can have sex with a girlfriend boyfriend no problem but condom use condomn it doesn't say that Z is Haram it doesn't say that fornication is Haram or adultery is Haram it gives you it shows you a way how to protect your Haram"
