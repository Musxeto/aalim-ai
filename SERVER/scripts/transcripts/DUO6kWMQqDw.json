  "transcript": "brother maher says is it okay to draw full-sized human with a beard a mustache and hair or a helmet but no head how about drawing full-sized women with hijab but no head are both of these permissible the issue of drawing live beings the majority say that this is prohibited and it's imitating the creation of allah azzawajal which is one of the most major sins in islam however like sheikha bin mean may allah have mercy and his soul says if the drawing has no life in it because the prophet said allah in the hadith jibril said to the prophet haslam order the statue to be decapitated remove the head so it becomes like a tree so when there is no life in this thing you're drawing this is permissible as sheikh bin athameen says and he gives an example by saying if you have no facial features is like a silhouette or it's just a shade or a picture but it doesn't have life there's no face there is no actual life in it in this case is permissible so if you draw a portrait with a helmet no face or you if you manage to watch the advert or the ad before this episode on zad tv they have infographics where they have pictures drawings of human beings without any facial features so you'll find a person but with glasses only no eyes no nose no mouth no ears and just a blank circle this is permissible this is not a living creature and there's no life in it so if you draw something like that this is permissible insha'allah you"
