  "transcript": "His question is how to be consistent, how to be single and happy while pursuing his dreams of getting a proper job before his pregnancy because actually he loves somebody but that person he loves doesn't love him. That's the issue. What is it? See this is the problem when you don't abide by Islam. I don't have this problem of loving someone who doesn't love me. Everybody loves me. But I don't have this problem because I don't sit with them. I don't give them the chance to love me or I love them back or relationships. This is haram in Islam. I do not sit with my own cousins because they're non-mahram to me. So I don't communicate with them on WhatsApp. Not that I am anti-social. No, my male cousins, they're brothers, I speak with them and I talk with them and I mix with them. But this is what happens when you don't abide by Islam. And this is what we mentioned that you will have a depressed life because you turned your back to Allah's remembrance. If you filled your heart with the love of Allah, you will not. How would a person feel jealous of others falling into sin? I could not understand this. The Prophet said in an authentic hadith, a scary hadith. This world is categorized for four types of people. Number one, a man whom Allah has given wealth and knowledge. So he's using his knowledge in what pleases Allah and spending the wealth in what pleases Allah. A man who Allah gave him knowledge but did not give him wealth. So he says, if I had the wealth of number one, I would do exactly like him. The Prophet says, they are in the same level of reward. With what? Intention. He doesn't have money, but he has knowledge. So he says, if I had money, I would have done exactly like him, build masjids, give charity. The third one, a man whom Allah did not give knowledge but gave wealth. So this man, having girlfriends, having haram income, enjoying life, going here and there. So he's very sinful. Correct? The fourth man, Allah did not give knowledge and did not give wealth. So he says, if I had the money this man had, I would have done this and this and this exactly like him. The Prophet said, they are in the same level of sin. Just because you intended it. So I can't understand how does someone see haram and wish, I wish I could do this. This is not me."
