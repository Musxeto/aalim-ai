  "transcript": "Hassan from Japan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Alhamdulillah My question is about the marriage and if I want to get married to my cousin like can I like you know in when you talk in three person or her father and herself and me like this is not common in my country and they feel like shy or like you know they it's not or it's not common in our country so they don't want to talk in front of their father so in this case can I go and I don't know like not just with my cousin but even with other girls can I just talk with her and with someone else like related to her or is it fine or is it not allowed JazakAllah Khair First of all it is not permissible to speak to non-mahrams whether they're your cousins or other girls or women this is totally prohibited it becomes permissible only when you have the right for the first interview where you are permitted in Islam to sit with her to exchange glances and to speak for half an hour or so so that one could determine whether there is this chemistry and the liking that is mutual between the both of you and then you can finalize accepting the marriage or not this can be done in the presence of the guardian and if they feel awkward about it the guardian can delegate this to his son his brother one of the mahrams of the girls where she would feel fine to do so to not have anyone or to do this behind the back of the guardian is not permissible and it would be considered as dating if you go and speak to her alone this is haram if you bring a friend or she brings a friend also this is not adequate or permissible and it is one of the steps of shaitan and Allah knows best"
