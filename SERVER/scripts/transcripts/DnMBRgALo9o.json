  "transcript": "his third question that one of his friends is insinuating that the hadith is not authentic it's not perfect we cannot trust the hadith while the Quran we can trust so he says I do not know what to answer him he says that hadith was compiled 200 years after the death of the prophet alayhi salaatu sam and this alone shows how ignorant your friend is your friend does not even know the basics of sunnah he doesn't know when the hadith was recorded the hadith was recorded at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam they were two competing in narrating the hadith abu hurayra may allah be pleased with him and i'm the live nomnom near us abu hurayra says i used to memorize the hadith but abdullah used to write more than me meaning that abdullah is too right above i used to memorize so the writing was there and there are a number of hadith where the prophet alayhi salatu salam ordered the companions to write a document for a Busha for example who came and said o prophet of allah he interrupted the friday sermon and said o prophet of allah write to me these things what you're saying there are so many so the Prophet ordered them to write for him and I leave that with Allah may Allah be pleased with him when they asked him did the Prophet as I give you any of your lineage your family something special hidden from us so he took a piece of paper from his holster and said nothing except what is found in this piece of paper and in it the some instructions of the blood money of the inheritance and some hadith written and this this was shared by the people not only for him but he had it written down so your well your friend is saying is totally absurd and the hadith was written as early as we only documented as the year 80 or 80 plus his jaw which had a lot of companions available abu hanifa may Allah have mercy on his soul died if I'm not mistaking on the year 150 he died and he compiled hadith and on that year Imam Shafi was born and we know that he compiled also the hadith imam ahmad ibn-hanbal was before the year 200 and he compiled hadith and Darryl cotton Imam Abu Hari and Imam Muslim all of them were around or before these 200 years and the companions that have been the tablet Abilene were all over the place so there is no need to argue with someone who's ignorant II that who does not know the history and who does not know the core and if this brother claims that the Quran is fine and we're okay with it he's falsifying the Quran because the Quran tells us to go and refer to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam this is the Sun without the Sun de you cannot understand the Quran Allah tells us in the Quran to pray does he tell us to pray in the furture the Horus or Mari Benicia split and specifically or generally does he tell us that fuzzy Restorick as MRIB is 3 and the rest are for no so where do we get this from where do we get the amount of zakat where do we get the lots of proper prohibitions except from the Sunnah and how things are done except in the Sunnah and the list goes on and on is"
