  "title": "If I listen to others backbite & do not condemn it or leave, am I sinful? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh muna says if a person does not practice or participate in backbiting but due to weak iman can't forbid the other person and cannot leave the place so does the one who is backbiting and the one who is only listening will get the same amount of sin this depends on the circumstances if the person is totally unable to speak out due to that the person who's doing the backbiting is the ruler or a tyrant officer or someone that could deliver some harm to him then the answer is yes you can stay quiet to save your own uh uh skin uh being not so uh um courageous is not an excuse the the excuse is whether there is harm or not so either there is real harm then you're excused there is no real harm you should speak out or at least change the subject totally or defend that person they're backbiting if you're unable to do any of these then you have to try and leave go to the toilet do something that is useful and allah azzawajal knows best"
