  "title": "How to wisely call someone to Islam? Do we mention do’s & don’ts or things like circumcision?",
  "transcript": "shihab from bangladesh we we've addressed his issue this is an islamic concept but not every islamic concept is wise to open any time or in any venue what is this islamic concept now i'm calling people to islam would it be wise to begin to talk about circumcision for men and they are not revered yet they haven't accepted islam this is the last of my priority list if i'm calling women to islam should i say that yes a man can marry four of women so you can be one of uh other three co-wives that no this is not wise and likewise when the people are all according to the media of disbelievers and hypocrites are all accusing islam of being a bloody religion that promotes violence this is a blatant lie and everybody knows that even the disbelievers themselves acknowledge that whoa the media has gone a little bit far this is not true we know we have thousands of muslim friends and they're the swedish people on earth if the muslims wanted to kill us they would have done that long time ago and they would have annihilated us there are two billion of them so it's it goes without saying but when we come to the beginning of the time when there was a standing war an existing war between islam and the disbelievers the idol worshipers the prophet assam used to send invoice expeditions armies to expand the turret territory and to call people to islam he did not say invade kill burn and annihilate on the contrary he said the first thing you do is give them dawah call them to islam show them the beauty the beauty of our religion show them the quran show them the system we have if they accept it leave them alone they're muslims like you move on let them be they're muslims if they say no we're not accepting this religion we don't like it then tell them that they have to pay what is known as taxation or jizya if they pay it and it's a very small amount only to be paid by men women children elderly they don't pay anything only men and it's similar to the zakat amount that all muslims pay in exchange for protection for living their lives without our interference if they do so move on if they say no we will not pay you anything then we have to fight so people say oh there is compulsion in religion this is forcing people by the sword no look what the superpowers are doing to the muslims and the non-muslims alike they are invading them they're killing them they are destroying their infrastructure they are killing them in the millions and i don't have to give examples you can look it up you can google it what had happened in the past 30 years mass uh weapons of destruction or weapons of mass destruction and they could not find a thing so then they said sorry after killing millions you come and say sorry so did anybody talk about their bloody religion or bloody democracy no of course so don't open topics that would not benefit islam the muslims at the moment when the muslims are so weak and so vulnerable and so separated when the time comes then people would see the beauty of islam as it should be seen and allah knows best"
