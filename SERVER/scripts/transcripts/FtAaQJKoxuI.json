  "transcript": "Zuwayrah from France. I have a question. Is it permissible to do extra things like fasting a certain number of days to emphasize and make our dua answered by Allah or should we just be content to ask Allah in time that dua must be answered? Jazak Allahu Khair. Fasting is not part of the things that would make your dua stronger or be answered quickly. It's not from the sunnah. However, it's a good deed. So if a person, for example, wants a particular job, he went for the interview, he made all the necessary tests and he's waiting for a reply and it's not coming. It's not from the sunnah for him to fast until it comes and materializes. This is not from the sunnah. Yes, it is from the sunnah to offer night prayer, to make dua between Adhan and Iqama at the last third of the night, to give charity, asking Allah Azza Wa Jal for his kindness. Yeah, this can be applicable, but fasting is not. However, if you fast Mondays and Thursdays or voluntary days and just before you break your fast, you make dua to Allah because you know that the dua of a person when breaking his fast is answered, in this case, inshallah, that would be fine and Allah knows best."
