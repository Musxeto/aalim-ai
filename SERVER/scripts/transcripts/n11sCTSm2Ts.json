  "transcript": "my heart's reach your mercy is what I beseech keeping my heart you'll remember and singing your Dean allow me to Advance help me in my quest permit me to pass this help me in my quest [Music] is dear brothers and sisters and welcome to this live episode of ask Huda coming to you every let's say Sunday and Tuesday at five o'clock local time here in Cairo Egypt as usual we will take your questions and you see the live numbers at the bottom of our screen feel free to call and ask your questions while we are anticipating and waiting for your calls sister Elizabeth says if another convert is not practicing and does not believe in Islam anymore if she comes back to it does she have to say shahada publicly or can she do it privately if a Muslim commits an act of apostasy between him and Allah everyone else still consider him or her to be Muslims so this is something between them and Allah if they go back and revert to Islam again and embrace it and they're remorseful and they're regretful they do not have to expose their sins and go to others and say listen we've committed this and that we have apostasized rather they just say the shahada and express their remorse to Allah and that would be sufficient insha Allah okay we have insha from India shake my question is a doctor and she's working as a doctor in a mixed environment and she receives her salary from a current account in an interest-based Bank is it allowed for her to do that because if it is a necessity uh kindly tell me how how it is a necessity to I mean open the current account and working her in a mixed environment to treat the female patients there and uh the transaction uh which the salary she is receiving is that is the transaction through that current account Halal or Haram kind of advice where is she working in Kashmir in India okay first of all insha in India to my knowledge they do not have Halal Banks all the banks that they have are conventional interest-based Banks which means that no matter what you do you either have a current account or a saving account in both cases to my knowledge they will give you interest whether you like it or not in such cases there is no sin on you as a Muslim to open a bank account due to your need to save your money in a safe place and to do your transactions we can't we do not we do not live in the Stone ages where we can tuck our money under the mattress people would rip you off in a heartbeat so there's no problem in doing this providing that you acknowledge that this interest is Haram and whatever the bank gives you you have to take it and dispose of it in means of Charity giving it to the poor and needy Muslims as for a female doctor that works in a mixed environment again this is a communal obligation a communal obligation means that if no women approach this field this would cause a lot of hardship for other Muslim women who are forced now to go and make their visitation with a male doctor whether Muslim or non-muslim so it's a doctor from the opposite gender and they may have to expose really private areas of their raura and this is shameful embarrassing and unislamic unless there is a need for it and there is no other Islamic acceptable alternative now having said that with the grace of Allah azzawajal if a woman a Muslim woman can participate in the medical field while abiding by her Islamic ethics not compromising her hijab and not socializing when it's not needed in this case as mentioned earlier this is a communal obligation and a Muslim honors and is proud with her hijab trying her level best to abide by old Islamic etiquettes as a Muslim woman working in such an environment and Allah azzawajal Knows Best from the Emirates Allah one question um Hoda has no boundaries it's not like ask that so you can have two questions but if there's someone that asked for something maybe like a year ago that says if you give me this money I want to use it to rent a shop but the first name didn't run the shop and it goes to another person I keep going around and taking money from family member saying that it makes it for a shot but he didn't do it so when the person comes to you again can you remind them and say listen last year I gave you money for a shop why are you asking me again for the same thing this year when you did it from Wednesday okay what's your second question and uh I said yes I have to go to sleep okay as for um amina's first question reminding others of the favors you have done to them is one of the major sins it's called in Islam and the prophet said Allah and among the three sins that Allah does not look at the individual does not speak to them does not have mercy upon them and would not purify them is who goes to people whom he had helped and said didn't I do this for you didn't I give you a loan yesterday in the sense of reminding them of their favor upon them so this is a major sin but if you know that there is someone who is a con man and he's going around taking people's money unlawfully and he forgot and he came to you and asking you for money or you're scolding him for what he's doing because now it's apparent that he's a blatant liar not that he's needy no you know that he is scamming people for their money when he pretends that he wants to open a shop or start a business and to stand up on his own two feet and he's a blatant liar he's a manipulator and a cheater so you tell him as form of scalding him I gave you money last year and you did not do anything with it there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah as for the second question and this is one of the advantages of having your control room reminding you because I'm used to one question alone in terms of the vast majority of them you can say them and still engage in communicating and talking with your husband or your children or using the phone as long as you're you're on your bed so it doesn't matter what you do after that it does not nullify them except with the Hadith that is highly recommended to be the last thing you say Allah This is highly recommended and there is another Hadith which I may recall later down the line that also is recommended that you say at the last but mainly speaking the Hadith should be the last thing you say before going to sleep if you speak once again then repeat it once uh again so that it will be the last thing you say and Allah Knows Best brother Muni from the U.S brother munib foreign should I be hopeful that he will be raised he will be raised among first of all we always try our level best to make Dua do our loved ones and specifically and to the Muslims at large who die upon Islam so whenever we mention their name we would say my grandma may Allah have mercy on her died two three years ago so I pray to Allah that he has mercy upon your grandma and all our loved ones secondly it is true that the prophet mentioned that those who die due to an illness whether in their side or due to an illness in their stomach they are in the status of a Shaheed a martyr though they did not die on the battlefield as per the Hadith seven are classified as Martyrs who do not die on the battlefield other than those who die on the battlefield and he mentioned one of them the one who dies with stomach pain and and disease so can we be Health uh hopeful the answer is definitely yes Allah's Mercy overwhelms everything so we are hopeful that Allah would include her among the shaheeds and Allah Knows Best from the Philippines yes um I have some questions number one is Virgin Mary from the Bible and Maria the Holy Quran are the same person okay and the second one um Can a Christian lose faith in Christianity permissible to discuss publicly through blog all about Islam can he do can he do what because we are a small uh can a Christian permissible to discuss publicly through blog all about Islam because um we are a small community of Filipinos here in Egypt and we are Disturbed to many of her followers taken her as a Muslim because she is wearing hijab so can you what can you advise us okay about her action regardless some of ustad's or Imam already requesting her to discontinue her vlogging about Islam okay so in regards to imagine's first question is Virgin Mary in the Bible the same as Maryam the mother of yes she's the same person and is the same person who had the miraculous birth of Issa or Jesus peace be upon him and she's the same one now whether some details May differ in her life and in the life of uh Maryam this is probable but it doesn't make them two different people as for the Christian lady who Vlogs about Islam and pretends to be a Muslim and people mistake her for a Muslim I don't see any harm as long as what she's doing is constructive and true if she's saying good things about Islam she's propagating good things about Islam even if she is not a Muslim I don't see any harm in leaving her to do what she is doing and at the same time try to call her to Islam try to be kind and nice and diplomatic with her so that she would be able to embrace what she's calling others too but if she is pretending to be a Muslim yet putting poison in the food and trying to tarnish the reputation of Islam by her actions wearing the hijab and the likes and then doing hideous things she has to be exposed wherever she is so that people are not deceived by her actions and Allah Knows Best uh brother Ismail from the U.S I have two questions if I may sure first one is in the Pakistani culture when somebody comes back from umrah or Hajj uh the relative and the prince invite them for dinner is that allowed permissible can we accept the invite okay the second tip is about about the gold business we have a jewelry store so if somebody purchases a merchandise uh on online and let's say we agree on a certain price today when the money is received within 24-48 people out is that allowed so in regards of the first question are rituals of Islam they're forms of worship now some cultures when a pilgrim comes back safely from his ritual they're happy and they tend to throw a party or to feast or to gather on our Lima what's the ruling on that this is permissible it's exactly when a person gets a promotion we throw a dinner on his behalf or if someone gets engaged no this is not a walima for marriage it's just an engagement they throw a feast there is nothing religious about it not just because he came from hajur umrah and they're throwing a dinner gathering for him that it makes it an innovation they're just happy because this person was blessed by Allah to complete his ritual and it's a chance for people to get together there is no nothing wrong in attending it inshaallah with this intention and Allah knows best as for the second question the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned to us six categories and he said gold buy gold silver by silver wheat by wheat barley by Barley Days by dates sold by salt these are the six main categories of items that lead the riba items other items fall underneath gold and silver you have currencies and banknotes falling underneath them so the prophet said when you are buying gold with silver or silver with gold there's no problem in that because this might be 200 grams and this might be 7 kilos so the weight difference is permissible because the items are different they're not identical it's not gold and gold it's gold and silver or gold and dollars but the profit put a condition and this condition is that such purchase and transaction has to be physically simultaneous meaning that I give you the dollars and in the same instance instance you give me the gold physically and I possess it instantly this is halal now if I have a gold shop and people send me requests to buy a necklace or a bracelet made of gold and they see it and they know the weight and they send me the money and I ship it to them overnight this is totally prohibited why I cash the money yes but it's not simultaneous therefore Scholars even went further by saying if I have a gold shop and someone comes to buy gold from me or silver through his credit card not through his ATM if it was through the ATM a thousand dollars is withdrawn immediately it appears on my bank account I get an SMS saying that a thousand dollars was deposited this is instantly done a credit card is not like that because there is a 40 days a grace period And I don't know when the bank is going to transfer this amount to you may takes it may take some time therefore such transactions are not permissible because the fact that there is no uh simultaneous exchange and physically and Allah Knows Best sister Zahra from Indonesia may I ask your questions yes okay um my first question is is it permissible to wash clothes in the same washing machine that was used by non-muslims because their clothes might have saliva of their dogs okay and my second question is I borrowed my motorbike to my friend and she used it to go to the church but I didn't say no because I'm afraid she will think I'm rude so is it uh am I sinful for that you knew beforehand that you you knew beforehand that she's going to the church Zara okay I think we've lost Sarah anyhow I'll try to answer both first of all what's the ruling on washing clothes that were licked by dogs or that contain dog's saliva the Hadith talks about utensils that dogs may eat from or lick so the prophet said if a dog eats or licks food or drinks from a utensil then you have to spill what's in it wash it seven times and dust it once so in the beginning you wash it with soil or dust then you wash it seven times with water some Scholars cascaded this even if the dog were to licked lick your hand or your trousers but this is not what the prophet said and the most authentic opinion is that washing seven times and one with soil is only when the dog uses the utensils a plate a bowl a spoon this is what we have to use seven times as for normal clothes or when a dog comes and licks your hand it just happens in kaffir countries a dog can just come and lick your hand so what should I do you just wash it normally without any problem so coming to your question there's no problem in washing these clothes in the same washing machine as it will be overwhelmed with water if you lent your car your motorbike your any type of ride to a non-muslim knowing that he or she will use that to go to their places of worship then you are sinful lending my car to a non-muslim period without knowing where he is going to use it isn't reversible I don't know where they're gonna use it so the default is that inshallah they will use it for Halal but if they tell me listen it's Sunday I need to go to church it so happens I'm the pastor I'm whatever it's totally prohibited to assist them on such in our religion an evil act and a display of disbelief and kufur and Allah Knows Best brother Idol from the Netherlands Michaela I have one question what to do to shirk this is not a question you have to be more specific like someone to check uh uh about you there's something he's worshiping me like um like to give something bad to you what to do okay what is the Shirk where is associating others than Allah if someone hurts me or talks bad about me or backbites me this is a sin now you're saying shirk is associating others with Allah Rupiah if I have an evil eye if I have gin possession if I have a disease if I have Envy if I have black magic I can do rookie for myself or I can come to you and say Adil you're a righteous practicing Muslim please do rotia for me and you recite rookia that is permissible in Islam such as verses of the Quran a Hadith of the of the Prophet sallam or normal Arabic words that have good meanings of Supplication to Allah this is halal when does it become shirk when you start asking the Jinn when you say words in gibberish that I don't know what they mean and nobody knows what they mean and most likely you're calling the Jinn or doing black magic yourself now this is shirk so I don't know if this answers your question or not but I hope it does we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back oh oh [Music] this is and welcome back we have brother Shaban from South Africa Shaban Brothers for four years you've been watching I mean okay I've been having a problem inside me for four years I I I mean I mean oh I mean but then uh for a year but in the middle of that I I I went I went to the same but then I didn't know those I decided to pay so I continued with the scene and then I started facing depression and then the side effects to for me continue in the film but I didn't know what else uh the same recording that so I came to know that it was like a father six to three days but then uh my situation didn't change but I I don't know what to what to do to change my situation because because I've tried for four years to change my situation is that breaking of the oath that good me into this information but I don't know how to fix it are we talking about pornography or masturbation the first one said okay okay first of all when you break an oath there is an expiation that you have to give and this is mentioned in the Quran which is one of the three you choose free a Slave or feed or clothe 10 poor people three choices either one you choose is okay freeing a slave is not applicable nowadays because they don't have slaves the other two are fine if you are unable financially to either feed or clothe 10 poor Muslims in this case you may resort to fasting three days jumping to three days before when you're able to feed or clothe 10 Muslim uh poor ones is not accepted so the three days you fasted these are voluntary days would not count as an expression for your broken oath secondly those who are doomed and tested with either watching pornography or masturbation masturbation or the likes of such genius sins these are their tests from Allah and we are on this Earth only to be tested there isn't a soul on Earth who's not tested even the richest of the richest he's being tested and the poorest of the poor is being tested now some may pass the test and end up in Paradise some May Fail and end up in hell it is you who decide there is no magical pill that would help you no one can justify his sin by saying I can't do anything about it if we tell you go to the highest building to a high Riser and jump you said you crazy why would I I would say don't you feel compelled to jump don't you feel that you wanna just jump and say I Believe I Can Fly not you crazy I don't want to die it's very good so why are you doing this sin oh Sheikh I can't help myself you can you did not jump you can also stop watching now how to do this this depends on the measures you take you want to pass the exams and get higher grades what are you going to do I'm gonna study hardship I'm going to isolate myself from my hobbies and my habits and my family to study really hard and in the end I would get the trophy a high glamorous a grades likewise when you want to stop the sin that you are indulged in you have to first of all do the preparation needed such as blocking all means so where do you watch this filth or on my smartphone on my PDA on my computer eliminate what do you mean you're smart phone that's making you stupid substitute it with a normal Nokia the Symbian operating system that has no internet that has no videos that you can play only to text and to uh take and and make calls the PDA and the laptop or the computer in the house eliminate all of this and if you live with your family buy a big screen with a PC where your back is not to the wall and the screen is to you rather it's the opposite the back of the screen is to the wall and your back is to the family to the living room so that everyone in the room can see anyone passing by can see what you're watching and you can have restriction not to watch it unless there is someone in the room not to have access to such porn yeah imagine if you're a young sister or brother where to fall into these sites and watch them because of you imagine if your children do this imagine if Allah punishes You by cascading this to your own family and what it and the the sad thing is if I were in the same room with you would you dare to watch it you're intimidating I'm scared from you I would never never attempt to do this Allah is watching you 24 hours seven days a week Allah is listening to everything you're listening to you don't have any shame you don't have any fear after all what Allah has given you so you have to do this as stage one and then you have to fill your time with beneficial things how many Jews of the Quran do you memorize how many hadiths do you know what's your knowledge in Islam you have to start filling your time with beneficial things thirdly you have to surround yourself with practicing righteous Muslims 24 hours seven days a week if you check your contact list you'll find that maybe you have a handful of them but you don't hang out with them you prefer sitting home alone watching this filth or you have a lot of non-muslims or non-practicing people who keep on putting fuel to the fire and share with you some of this Haram filth so whatever there's a will there is always a way but again nobody is gonna give you a magical pill it's all in your hands you make oath you make promises you do this you do that nothing is going to help you unless you put it in your mind and ask Allah for guidance and really take serious and uh steps and measures to stop this filter and Allah Knows Best uh Zeba from India that's right yes but brother I uh brother I had three questions so my first question is while praying the two records of Sunnah prayer in the ishanamas so if by mistake I pray three rakas can I consider this as vitra or should I then again pray the three uh with the prayer what did you intend first question what did you intend you cannot add or subtract this is what you intended if you added the third raka the third raka is void you can't say oh okay you just to save time I will consider it to be Witcher no this is void you have to immediately sit for tashahood and continue your prayer as to and offer two prostrations of sahu second question [Music] tips of both the hands or on the fingertips of only the right hand they're so nice to do it only on the right hand the prophet Allah recommended doing this be on your fingertips and said that they will talk on the day of judgment to testify so this is only to do on the right hand if someone does it on both hands this is permissible but it's not part of the Sunnah so the Sunnah is to say subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah you can hold this to count that I've just done a set of five and another one and this this is not this B has done on the right and this one is just to keep the score if you don't want to do neither and you want to use a prayer beat this is also permissible but it is not as rewarding number three question is that my his name is Cheyenne and on this name his akika has been done but we call him Abdullah because it has a good meaning uh so is it permissible that can we call him Abdullah at home has nothing to do with the naming process so if you call him Cheyenne and then two years later you wanted to change his name into Abdullah there's nothing wrong in that you don't know have to sacrifice another or the first is void just because of the changing of the name so these are two separate things can you name him or call him Abdullah this is better a thousand times than Cheyenne because he's not a indigenous Indian tribe and secondly the best and most beautiful and beloved names to Allah and this Hadith is Abdullah and Abdullah these are the most beloved names to Allah so definitely calling him Abdullah is a plus and Allah Knows Best brother Yusuf from the Emirates yeah Yusuf do we have Yusuf or we've lost him hello yes Yusuf yeah yeah so um my question is influencing is like telling people to do righteous and stop them from doing this experience and stuff is this mandatory or is it my business I did not get your question properly if I'm in school and a lot of people do bad things like for example they have girlfriends they they maybe they March at their beers they might keep their hands under their ankles if I advise them is this permissible or do I have to mind my business I don't know what to do okay first of all Allah praised Us in the Quran by saying um you were among the best of Nations produced to the people for doing what for enjoining virtue and righteousness and forbidding Vice and Evil so this is something that Allah praised Us by yet this is a science this is an art and we just don't jump the gun as we are not the religious police who whose duty is to go around and detect people's faults and correct it if you're in this at school you can't every single day 24 hours seven days a week keep on scolding people your trousers are below the ankle don't speak to that girl she's Nan maharam girl you have to cover your hair and wear prop appropriate clothes teacher don't shave your beard Headmaster don't smoke outside smoking is bad for you don't watch Haram videos don't listen to Haram music and then people would look at you as a menace your cycle you have to be diplomatic you have to be knowledgeable you have to be wise what is the definition of wisdom wisdom is to place things in the right place you can't place a rectangle in a circle area this is not wise this is not part of the hikmah so you have to prioritize things you have to make the people accept you respect you love you believe that you're knowledgeable believe that you're sincere and giving them advice and then look at the appropriate time to give such an advice you can't go in front of the whole school or in front of the whole class or in front of a group of people and scold one for a sin he's doing he would not accept that and his arrogance would come out and kick back and maybe would do something horrific or horrible to you you have to know exactly when is the right place and the right time and the right person that you address and the more you gain knowledge and learn insha Allah that would be easier to attain and learn those best Muhammad from India okay I think we've lost Muhammad hello oh Muhammad hello yes what can I do for you yes yes Allah for more than two years and about my belief in Islam and they are too intense and when I say I can't even say like it with uh when I say I don't have that certain city while saying it to dense why don't you leave Islam yes sir why don't you leave Islam what's keeping you I'm asking you answer me oh we did not take that literally and left Islam already and hung up so answer me why don't you leave Islam what's that because I know it's the truth okay and because you're afraid of Hellfire and because you want to go to Jannah correct yes sir now if the enemy of Islam whether he's the president or the Prime Minister comes to you with a glass of orange juice and he says oh um Muhammad Muhammad drink this orange juice is good for you will you drink it you know why because he's evil because he's evil and you know that he has definitely put poison in it now you tell me when you come and says Muhammad who is this verse coming from oh Sheikh it's coming from Satan my Fierce enemy so I said why do you believe him how is it logical that you listen to him how can I help you put earplugs in your ears I can't this is something you have to do so when you have the belief that Allah is the truth that there is hellfire you are afraid of this is what's keeping you in Islam because you believe when Satan comes to you and says no you should not listen to this you are a cafe and you are a disbeliever and you believe him rather than believing your own intuition and your own strong faith this is something wrong in your head I can't help you with that you have to draw the line and say enough is enough I'm not gonna be a football that Satan tosses to his devils and they play around with me I'm a Muslim I love Allah I love the Quran I love Prophet Muhammad I'm fully convinced with it so enough is enough you stop this and inshallah you will prevail Omar from the UK and he would be our last caller inshallah so my question is uh what is your opinion on the shakes locked up in Saudi and especially one of them called Sheikh Khalid or Rashad okay okay listen listen listen to me these questions are way above your pay grade people you don't know them people you have never met in your life people you've never had an idea of what crimes they have may have committed who dare you speak without knowledge they're good Scholars they're beneficial have you met them no but I heard in a YouTube blogger saying so and so I read somewhere so and so so what is it is it that you have beef against a country that calls people to tell hate that teaches Islam that spreads the dawah all over that implements Sharia this is illogical how on Earth do people think like this and the haters will always be haters have they said anything about that if Shia the khadiadis the Baha'is those deviant sufis those who worship idols and Graves nothing they have a clear Shack of endorsement of their actions but when it comes to something I'm not saying that this is right or wrong I'm saying that do you have knowledge of it no do you know these people no so what are you doing it's a simple old way of tarnishing the reputation of those who are known to do good and this happens everywhere people just keep on throwing accusations left right and Center without knowledge and this is not something that Islam promotes this is not something beneficial for Islam this is not something beneficial for the dawah to the cause of Allah azzawajal then what are you doing you're undermining Islam and the efforts of the Muslims to call others to Islam so my advice is their life this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave [Music] to advance help me in my quest permit me to pass the ultimate and have helped me my quest [Music]"
