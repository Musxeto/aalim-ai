  "transcript": "Where we are at the moment, I've seen a clip a \nbrother sent to me yesterday, was very beautiful,   and it was like a minute and a half, down \nthe streets of I think Jakarta in Indonesia   where people were on their benches, \non the streets, outside shops,   thousands of them, during the daytime, opening \nthe Quran just reading, and you find them   all around you just reading the Quran, these \nare non-arabs, probably they don't understand   the Quran but the connection they have with \nAllah knowing that this is the word of Allah,   and they're reciting it seeking the reward from \nAllah it tells you the whole story about Islam   imagine if you add to that the desire \nto understand what Allah wants from you   and to go and check the Tafsir and then implement \nit in your life these people are reading the Quran   like you find people on the tube or \non the underground reading a novel,   these guys are reading the Quran \nseeking Allah's guidance from it"
