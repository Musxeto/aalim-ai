  "transcript": "and he said that did you say that don't look at the sinner but i didn't say that i said don't hate the sinner rather hate the sin itself because this sinner has many good things in him that we like and the bad things and the sins in him we hate so if you're talking about this yes this is a a concept or a phrase that is circulated among scholars and you find it in their books this is not a hadith and allah knows best"
