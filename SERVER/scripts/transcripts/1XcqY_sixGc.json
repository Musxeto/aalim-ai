  "transcript": "Salman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh my question is when my mom reverted she missed her very first Ramadan fast because of wrong advice from a non-Muslim doctor so you told her to make up this fast now she has completed all her missed fast but the problem is in some of her fast she followed the timing provided by a local masjid this masjid follows the Islamic finder timetable the problem with this timetable is that it is already mentioned in their website that they have delayed Fajr and Maghrib by one minute to be on the safe side to start the prayer so in some fast my mom actually kept on drinking water when the Fajr time already started by one minute I told her to complete the Zuhr meal few minutes before Fajr to be on the safe side but she might have forgot and or she did not listen I don't know she does not have a count of the number of this fast so what to do with this fast and Sheikh please pray for my father that he accepts Islam and you are going all where all other countries but not coming to India so I request you to come to India once and have a lecture session or something like that Jazakumullah Khairan. Jazakum. As for your mother she has done her duty and followed the local masjid so there is nothing wrong in what she had done because she is obliged to follow the masjid whether the masjid follows the Islamic finder or some other app or they do it on their own they're accountable on the day of judgment so all of her facts are valid and there is no problem and she doesn't have to make up any day inshallah. As for your father I pray to Allah Azza wa Jal that he guides his heart to Islam and that he expands his chest and fills it with Iman and that he guides him to rectify his affairs with what pleases Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala according to the law of Islam."
