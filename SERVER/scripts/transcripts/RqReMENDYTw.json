  "transcript": "by the way i've been having so many calls from uh sisters from norway and from denmark complaining about imams doing wrong things some of them are soothsayers some of them claim to know the future some of them cross all boundaries and sit with non-mahrams without any uh people being around being in seclusion with them an imam sitting with a foreign woman a revert taking her in his car and going to places and this is not an imam and this may indicate that watch out from those who work as imams to do get the citizenship they would serve the disbelievers aims because they're arabs or the refugees but they're appointed as an imam when they have no knowledge in islam when they are only there for financial gains not every person leading the prayer is to be trusted unless he's proven to be a righteous practicing brother who has knowledge and who walks the talk you"
