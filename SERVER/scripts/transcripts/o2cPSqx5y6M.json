  "title": "For Dhur Sunnah prayers do we recite the opening Dua and Isti'adhah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Obey from Tunisia. Yeah my question is in sunnah prayers that have two tashahud like the four rakahs before dhuhr, do we recite the opening supplication and the isti'adah only at the beginning or once in the first rakah and once again in the third rakah after saying takbeer? First of all it's an issue of dispute whether sunnah before dhuhr of four rakahs to be treated as a single prayer like dhuhr or a separate prayer two by two. Abu Hanifa's madhhab is to deal with it as four like dhuhr and Sheikh al-Albani authenticated some of the hadiths that they are four. The vast majority of scholars say that voluntary prayers should be two concluded by salam then another two concluded by salam and so on. Depending on the hadith salatul layli mathna mathna and another addition salatul layli wa n-nahar which some scholars made that weak. However when you pray for sunnah together as a one single prayer a lot of the scholars would say you're blamesworthy. This is not according to the sunnah but if you break it into two by two even the Hanafis would say okay it's not the best thing to do but yeah it's your prayer is accepted. Hence this is what I recommend you to do. Secondly if you insist and say no I'd like to follow the hadith according to Sheikh al-Albani's authentication and to Abu Hanifa's madhhab and I pray it as a single prayer. In this case the isti'adah and the duaul istiftah can only be said in the first rakah and the first second third and fourth rakah. You don't say that and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
