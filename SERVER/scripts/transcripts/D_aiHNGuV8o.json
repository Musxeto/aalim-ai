  "transcript": "and welcome to this new episode of your program the basics yesterday we spoke an introduction about the quran which is the core of islam the message of islam the basics about islam and when you look at the quran the ultimate miracle the word of allah you will find that it is infallible and it is a miracle to the end of time this quran is a gold mine an endless source of good deeds for those who believe in it and allah says in the quran and we send down from the quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe so it's a healing and it's a mercy with the condition that you believe when you believe in the quran gates of provisions gates of allah's mercy would open wide for you to reap and take whatever you can only when you believe in the quran the prophet said instructing his ummah recite the quran for it will come on the day of judgment a form of intercession to those who recite it imagine on that day where everyone is scared frightened horrified the quran that you used to recite will come to intercede to you and it's a gold mine because you can gain so much good deeds and rewards has an ad without an end the prophet said was whoever recites a single letter from the quran allah azzawajal would give him one good deed that would multiply to 10 good deeds i do not say alif lam meme is a letter rather alif is a letter lam is a letter and meme is a letter so your clock is ticking the more you read the quran and this answers the question of so many people who say i read the quran but i do not understand arabic you'll be rewarded even if you don't understand a letter of what you're reading because this is the word of allah and allah loves when his servant reads his words when his servant recites the quran to the extent that it depends on your memorization of the quran which sets your level in jannah the prophet says the man or the woman the individual who memorizes the quran it will be said to him on the day of judgment recite and read and give tartil as you used to in this dunya for your last step and level in paradise is where your last ayah you memorized would be which means that if you memorize the whole quran you'll be at the very top level if you memorize half of it you'll be in the half level if you memorize few surahs you will be at that level and this is an encouragement to those who have brains the prophet said the best of you the best among all of you all muslims those who learn the quran and teach it so when you learn the quran and you teach it to others you are considered to be among the elite and if we would like to mention the hadiths and talking about the virtues of the quran it would not suffice us one or two or three segments but these are a reminder these are reminders of the importance of the quran in our lives because this is the basic now how are the muslims coping with this how are they dealing with the quran well allah mentions in the quran that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam objected to allah about what his people are doing so allah says and the messenger has said o my lord indeed my people have taken this quran as a thing abandoned [Music] they've abandoned the quran the prophet is complaining now what is meant by abandoning the quran there are different levels one of the most common level among the ignorance among the hypocrites is abandoning listening to it reciting it believing in it and this is unfortunately obvious you can see that in many people not that many but there are people whom subhanallah if you were to play the quran to them they would fall asleep if you ask them to read the quran they keep on yawning every five or ten seconds there are people when you coat an ayah or recite the quran or play it on your mp3 or on youtube or watch it on tv they're agitated they're disturbed by it and without doubt this is a sign of a person's heart being sealed and it can be even more dangerous and it can signify that this person is a full-fledged hypocrite may allah protect us now allah says in the quran that there are people when quran is recited to them they don't take this well listen to this ayah and when allah is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink with aversion they have hatred to it but when those worshipped other than him the almighty are mentioned immediately they rejoice this is what a lot of the people nowadays are going through whenever they hear the quran whenever they hear the quran so many people love to listen to music to songs even to nasheed over listening to the quran and this is a very serious offense an indication of how little your iman is others may listen to the quran yet still they abandon it how they're listening to it they are reading it they're doing this for the sake of barakah they just want the blessing a lot of the people play the quran 24 hours seven days a week as if it's background music they're not listening to it and if you ask them which surah is this so i don't know what was the last ayah the man just recited i don't know so why are you listening to the quran he said it's baraka it's better than not listening to anything some people study or work out while listening to the quran without paying any attention to it and this is not what the quran was revealed for some people recite the quran and give the reward to the dead and this is an innovation the living are more deserving of benefiting from the quran and the dead some of them even use the quran to make amulets and talismans and tawis and this is a form of shirk it's not permissible others honor the quran so they claim by hanging it on the walls as a form of decoration and sometimes you enter a house with so many verses and you ask the individual what is this i said i don't know can you memorize any did you ever read any he said no likewise in messages so many decorations verses of the quran nobody pays attention to it and allah did not reveal the quran to be a form of decoration even on the curtains of the kaaba you find beautiful calligraphy but you can't read it you don't know what's written it's so complicated even for us arabs and this is not what quran was revealed to and unfortunately those who recite it who read it they simply put it and keep it in their glove compartment in the car or under the pillow as a form of protection again this is not permissible and this is a form of abandoning what the quran was truly revealed for another form of abandoning the quran is a more serious one is when you refuse to accept the quran to be the ultimate source of legislation in your life and you think that the verses are not certain they are probable and that the wordings do not confirm what is meant and that it might be ambiguous in a way which leads you to refusing making it the main source of legislation and something that you go and seek guidance from in the main principles of islam and also in the minor principles of islam you tell me how many quote unquote muslims people with the name of muhammad or ahmed or abdullah who reject the quran totally or partially among the muslims so many don't be deceived by their names or by their nationality or by their languages they claim to be muslims but they're not they reject quran as a whole or portions of it because it does not go side by side with their democracy it does not go side by side with human rights or with their sick minds so some of them may reject the quran why because it has the prescribed punishments an eye for an eye no no no this is barbaric someone who deliberately murders a person we have the right in islam to ask for a life for a life this is prescribed in the quran you steal money your hand is chopped you slaunder an innocent woman you're flogged 80 lashes you commit fornication this happens and those people with their sick mind say no we cannot accept this not accepting it is kufur takes you immediately out of the fold of islam regardless of your name some of them rejects polygamy so marrying more than one wife to them is not permissible illegal and they oppose it publicly though it is part of the quran part of islam some of them even goes a bit further like we've heard this in some muslim countries where they say it's not fair to give a daughter half what the son gets in inheritance so we would like to abolish this and they have to be equal some parents living in america and the uk do this when they write their will despite the opposition and objection of their children they say this is haram you're going against allah's commands so no no no this is harmony all of you should be equal in distribution of the inheritance after my death not knowing by rejecting the quran they've abandoned it and they've committed an act of apostasy some of them would refuse accepting the quran and would go to man-made laws and this happened and i've done this in many counseling sessions unfortunately women in the states they seek divorce or their husband divorces them usually they seek divorce because the husband took a second wife she could not stand this and tolerate it she asked for divorce she is awarded divorce or huller and she goes to the man-made kafir laws of the country that and demands half of the man's wealth the hard earned money that he spent 20 30 years working for she comes and takes half the property half the business half the savings whose religion is this and when we talk to her sister you're a muslim your name is aisha your name is fatima yeah but i've spent 20 years of my life for nothing and then he gets married again no i'm gonna punish him you're not punishing him you're punishing yourself in hell fire you're going to hell for your act of apostasy in rejecting the quran rejecting the sharia enjoy the money enjoy the ride you have only five ten years to live but man will you be punished like crazy in your grave as a preparation for your punishment in hell fire what are you doing these people abandoned the quran they don't care what the quran says they only follow the whims and desires another form of abandoning the quran is abandoning pondering upon it contemplating on the beautiful meanings that it includes not being able to succeed in understanding what allah wants from us so yes we may read the quran we may recite it but we are short of going the extra mile reading the tafsir understanding what allah wants from us through it and implementing it in our lives imagine if you as an individual managed to devote half of your time not all of it no let's be fair just devote half of your time even 25 of your time that you spend on social media on reading newspapers on watching the news on watching netflix or haram showtime programs etc rubbish if you devote 25 so if you spend eight hours just spend two hours of these eight hours reading the quran pondering upon it checking the meanings in the books of tafsir how would our lives be if we managed to do this we wouldn't be where we are at the moment i've seen a clip a brother sent to me yesterday was very beautiful and it was like a minute and a half down the streets of i think jakarta in indonesia where people were on their benches on the streets outside of shops thousands of them during the daytime opening the quran just reading and you find them all around you just reading the quran these are non-arabs probably they don't understand the quran but the connection they have with allah knowing that this is the word of allah and they're reciting it seeking the reward from allah it tells you the whole story about islam imagine if you add to that the desire to understand what allah wants from you and to go and check the tafsir and then implement it in your life these people are reading the quran like you find people on the tube or on the underground reading a novel these guys are reading the quran seeking allah's guidance from it i know people that have lived their entire life without finishing the quran once in their lifetime and this shows you the gap between argent our generation and the generation of the companions may allah be pleased with them imagine the prophet alice islam asked his companion abdullahi how many times do you read the quran abdullah said i recite the whole quran once every night and that is in prayer at night time prayer finishing the whole quran out of his own memory while praying takes what seven hours he does that every single night the prophet said no take it easy on yourself recite it once a month so every night you'll set one jesus that's sufficient he said no i can do more the prophet said every twenty he said i can do more the prophet said finish the quran once every ten nights he said no i can do more the prophet agreed that he finishes the quran once a week in another narration once every three days not any less this is how eager the companions where to read the book of allah to ponder upon it to implement it in their lives and you can see how much time we devote for instagram snapchat whatsapp youtube facebook twitter let alone watching the news the six hour news and nine hour news reading newspapers reading blogs all of these things distract us from our original target from our mission and vision this is not going to take us to jannah the quran is and the final form of abandoning the quran where allah azzawajal told us as you've heard in the beginning and we send down from the quran that which is a healing and a mercy the quran is one of the best forms of healing mentally and physically so mentally we have no doubt it cures your heart from malice from hatred from enmity from grudges from envy it purifies your heart from shirk from sins from doubts from whispers of the shaitaan but it heals you also physically and there are so many evidences to back this up hadith of abuse be pleased with him how he managed with the fatiha to cure someone on his deathbed due to a sting of a snake or a scorpion reciting the fat hand blowing on him and the guy was on his feet in no time and the prophet confirmed this and he said that yes it is a cure it can cure your physical pains if you believe and if you're consistent and if you express your poverty to allah azza therefore the abandonment of the quran abandoning the quran unfortunately is prevalent nowadays among the muslims except few and it depends it differs in levels so those who recite it 24 7 are happy say wait we're not abandoning it yet they may abandon it in a different form whether it comes to legislation whether it comes to a form of healing etc you need to check yourself and see what's the status of quran in your heart imam nawahi says the whole ummah the consensus of all the muslims that we have to glorify the quran and we have to purify it from being insulted humiliated or discredited and the whole ummah they unanimously agree that whoever rejects one single letter of the quran or adds to it a single letter that no one has read about this and he knows that that he's an apostate disbeliever they also agree that whoever takes anything from the quran lightly does not take it seriously makes fun of it or throws it in a place that is disrespectful like the dustbin or the sewer whoever falsifies what's mentioned in the quran and he says no no this is not true humans are not from adam and eve he claims humans have evolved from apes this is a kafir whoever says that whoever says that the jews and mentioned in the quran are a myth or this he says that they have already come i don't know about that or says that they're zombies what kind of nonsense is this whoever rejects anything of the quran or approves something that the quran says is not true whoever doubts the quran that it is from allah that it is the word of allah or doubts anything that is mentioned in it while knowing it and there are no obstacles to prevent us from giving him tak fear he is a kafir therefore this is the rope of allah that we should all hold on to strongly we should abide by it this is the basics not the books of philosophy not the books of novels and stories not the books of different regimes like uh socialism or capitalism or this is the only way of life the only way to live and you will never prosperous or succeed if you abandon it we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
