  "title": "Is the end of Fajr at SUNRISE ? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "binta from Italy so I wanted to ask like the end of f is like at Sunrise because like if I search on Google the sunrise of my city it's like uh 1 hour or two after of so I don't know is that correct or no the f time ends the moment the tip of the sun rises so if the sunrise timing in Google or on the website is referring to the beginning of the rising of the sun then this is the end of the fer time which is most likely is so you have to finish your fud prayer at least 5 or 10 minutes before that time and Allah knows best and if you finish it before 20 minutes that is safer for you"
