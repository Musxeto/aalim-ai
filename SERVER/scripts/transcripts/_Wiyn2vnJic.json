  "transcript": "All right, next question please. Assalamu Alaikum, my name is Hakimi from Kedah. I just graduated from Tafiz Wal-Kiraat Approval Course in my university. I'm your YouTube subscriber and fans, I'm sorry, maybe an air conditioner of you. I want to get married but my mom said that I have to get my PhD first. It takes me maybe five years more to get graduated. Maybe I'll get it after I complete my master. So how can I convince my mother that I am old enough to prepare myself by the way of the sunnah? According to Rahiq Al-Muqtum, the famous book of Sirah Nabi, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ married at the age around 25 years old with Ummul Muminin, Khadijah bint Khuwail. If I complete my master then I have reached 25 years. Is your mother with us? No. Okay, the answer is, first of all, when you want to get married, you have to be a man. So you can't be a mummy's boy. If you're a mummy's boy, don't get married until you grow up. Number two, mothers, with all due respect, don't know what is best for their children when it comes to marriage. The father does. When you're 16, the father says, bring you a bride. The father knows the danger of not being married, especially in a society that is open and everything goes. So if you are an independently, financially speaking, man, you can open your own house, you can provide for your wife and yourself and children, be diplomatic, be kind and dutiful to your mom. But at the end of the day, you have a choice between marrying or falling into sin. No, go to marriage. Even if your mother opposes this, be diplomatic. Don't be disrespectful or undutiful. Be a good child, but at the end of the day, what's right is right. You have to get married. Waiting five years. What is this? How old are you? Just give me a figure, I can hear it. 22. 22? I got married when I was 23. So we're not that far. And I was late in getting married. I should have married way before. So alhamdulillah, 22 is a good age to get married if you're financially independent. But if you need your mom's money, no, this is a no-go. You have to seek her permission. If you're financially independent, can work and pursue your PhD or whatever, then go ahead and Allah knows best. All right, that was our first time ever seeing a walking air conditioner, actually. All right, moving on."
