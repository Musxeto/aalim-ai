  "transcript": "Javad from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh. So my question is I sold a few video games and I just recently discovered that it's not permissible. So like as for the money, can I keep it or like can I use it instead of or get counseling with the Sheikh? So whatever you did out of ignorance and you gained money out of that, the money is halal. Because Allah Azza Wa Jal tells us that He would not torment a people before sending them a messenger. Meaning before they acknowledge and know what is right and what is wrong. In your case, when you sold these games, you thought it was halal. Therefore, whatever money you made in the past when you did not know the ruling is halal as well."
