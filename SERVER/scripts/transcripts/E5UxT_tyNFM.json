  "transcript": "asthma's question from Denmark is exactly in line with what I had just said about migrating to the kafir lands he's saying that there is a law and it might be passed where it prevents girls from wearing their headscarf in year 9 which means that there are 15 years of age and he says so what's the ruling on us living there if they force our daughters to take off their head scarves what kind of democracy is this what kind of people are those who force girls to go against their will if the girl is convinced of her religion she has a conviction that it is mandatory why or who are you to force her not to wear it it's okay for you to strip but naked this is okay this is freedom it's okay for you for girls to wear bikinis this is okay but for them to be modest and cover this is oppression why don't you go and address your Catholic nuns and ask them to remove their hijab and to remove their a costume that they're wearing because this is another form of oppression why don't you ask them to come out in many skirts as well so the trend in nun Islamic countries and maybe some Islamic countries unfortunately the trend is to fight any form of modesty hijab nabob wearing decent clothes people are irritated by this they are unable to cope up with such modest people who preserve their chastity they want them to be like them and this is a no-go for Muslims so argument if this passes you definitely must not take your children your girls to school period do whole schooling and if this is also pursued after and they would incriminate you for doing such a thing then you have to migrate and go to maybe Germany is better UK definitely is better what but with the brexit I don't know what's the outcome of that definitely countries that oppose Islam in such a fashion you must not live in it"
