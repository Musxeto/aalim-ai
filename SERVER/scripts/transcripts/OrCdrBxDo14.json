  "transcript": "uh I was wondering are the doors of ishti had still open I haven't seen it closed yet yes it's still open any reason for that I was just wondering I've heard from many people that it's impossible to get that at this time so how would it how would a person try to become one oh no no this is a total different ball game my friend ishti had can only be done by Scholars and they're a handful for us laymen we do not have the ability to have ishtihad but is the door of stihad still open the answer is yes those who claim that it is closed these are the blind followers of schools of thought whether hanafi Maliki shafri or hambali so they don't want people to go out of their Circle so they say no you cannot improvise you cannot make ishtihad you cannot come up with rulings that were not there 500 years ago but we have new stuff we have Bitcoin we have a new material that was not available 50 years ago let alone 500 years ago so definitely we do have ishtihad but it is not for you and me rather it is for those who are um well-founded uh Scholars of Islam"
