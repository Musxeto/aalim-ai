  "transcript": "from the u.s um someone constantly lies to other people while i'm around them would i be sinful if i were to assume that they were lying to me when they speak to me give an example um okay if someone um if the person that lies so much tells another person that they're traveling soon and i know they're not traveling um and i know they're not traveling and then when they tell me like they're gonna go shopping and i think they're not gonna go shopping because they keep lying so much to other people okay so what's the question am i sinful if i were to assume that they were lying to me because no i heard no no there's there's no sin because you did not speak about it nor acted upon it allah says avoid a great chunk of suspicion and doubt because some of it might be sinful yes the whole thing is not sinful but some of it might be sinful therefore avoid the whole package so if you assumed that this person is lying due to a record a track record now you fool me once shame on you you fool me twice shame on me he lies and lies and lies and if he finally says something that i presume that it is lying i wouldn't be sinful for that because his track records proves that he is a blatant liar and a chronic liar so there's no problem in that inshallah you"
