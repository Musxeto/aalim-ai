  "transcript": "Muni from Canada. Sheikh, if I speak perfect Arabic but I make sujood in English, I want to know does this invalidate my prayer? All actions and dhikr accompanying your actions and salat must be in Arabic. So if someone says Allah is the greatest, his prayer is invalid. If he says glory be to Allah Azza Wa Jal, the Great, Al Azeem, instead of Subhana Rabbi Al Azeem, his prayer is invalid. If he says Samia Allahu Liman Hamidah, Allah hears and responds to whomever praises Him. His prayer is invalid. It has to be all in Arabic. The exception is if you're in sujood and you say Subhana Rabbi Al A'la, this is the prescribed dhikr for sujood, then you want to ask Allah Azza Wa Jal to pay off your debt for example, and you don't know how to say it in Arabic. So it is permissible to say it in English. That is after you've said the prescribed dhikr in Arabic and did your obligations, providing you don't know how to say it in Arabic. You say, Oh Allah, pay off my debts. But if you do know how to say it in Arabic, Rabbi iqdi'anni dayni, and you insist on saying it in English, this invalidates your salat and Allah knows best."
