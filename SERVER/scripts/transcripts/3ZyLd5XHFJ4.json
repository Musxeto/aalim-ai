  "transcript": "Ahmed from Bangladesh asalam alikum sh shik my question is regarding shik of fear so if someone tells me not to do something and in his absence I want to do it but I refrain not for fear of Allah but because I respect that person and would feel guilty for betraying his trust is this shik since I heard that if someone tells you not to do something and you don't do it even if he is not present out of glorifying him it is sh are you are you worshiping him yes or no Ahmed yes are you worshiping him no then this fear is normal at 3:00 after midnight a.m. when I am at a traffic light and it's red I look right and I look left there's no one at all within a 100 yards I still do not cross the red light am I committing shik fearing The Authority there are no traffic cameras there's no one who could give me a ticket but I still stop am I committing shik no not every fear is sh and not every love if I adore my wife and I love her crazily and madly I hope but does this consist constitute shik of course not the shik of love the shik of fear the shik of this and that has to be associated with revering and worshiping the person and not just merely the fear"
