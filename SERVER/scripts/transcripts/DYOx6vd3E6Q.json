  "transcript": "The first question is, I swallowed the food in my mouth at the time of Fajr Adhan. Is my fast valid? First of all, fasting is to refrain from things that nullify fasting such as eating, drinking, and intercourse, etc. from the break of dawn till sunset. This is the definition of fasting for the sake of Allah Azza Wa Jal, to worship Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala. Now, if a person swallows solid food, whether it's beneficial or not, anything that is solid that goes into a person's stomach, this breaks his fasting. If there are remaining food particles in a person's teeth, for example, if they have a mass and he could dispose of them, he could take them out, yet he does not, and he swallows them intentionally, this invalidates his Salat, this invalidates his fasting as well. But if they're too negligible, too small, and one has no ability to take it out or spit it out, then it's forgiven with the grace of Allah and swallowing it would not impact your Salat nor your prayer, your fasting. Now, the case that the brother is asking about, or the sister, it did not specify, is that if I'm eating a sandwich and I'm chewing it and the Adhan is called, should I spit it out? The answer is no, Inshallah, you're not obliged to spit it out, but don't finish the whole sandwich. So what's in your mouth, you can eat it, consume it, swallow it without any problem. Why? Because the Adhan of Fajr is relative, so it could be a minute early, a minute late, and you don't have certainty 100% that this is the break of dawn. And due to the hardship in spitting out this morsel that you have in your mouth, and due to the Hadith where the Prophet stated that when a person is holding a mug or a container that has liquid in it, and the Adhan is called, he should not put it down until he consumes whatever he wants from it. So comparing this to that, Inshallah, this morsel in your mouth would have the same ruling, and Allah Azzawajal knows best.
