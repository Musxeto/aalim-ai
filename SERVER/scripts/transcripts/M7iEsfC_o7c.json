  "transcript": "iba sent a text message and says that my father abuses me physically mentally and sexually i haven't told anyone but now he does not do anything because he is out of the country if you raise my voice or if i raise my voice here tell my past to anyone am i sinful this is an issue that is difficult to address now people would not understand this especially nowadays with the metoo movement with the feminist movements with so-called freedom of speech and democracy and the likes cultures differ differ now ariba says my father did this and that can she prove it the answer is no so what would this be classified in islamic in a court of law if i were to come in public and say ariba abused me sexually harassed me of course people would laugh but i'm i'm giving a claim so what is the logical thing to do the judge would come to me and say prove it if i have evidence then that would be a proof i can step forward and talk about it if i can get ariba to confess and say yes yes i am i'm pleading guilty i did all of that then i have a case but if she says no i didn't do anything then it's my word against hers and coming forward and speaking would be plain slandering me so if you go and talk about your father and claim that he sexually harassed you do you have any proof she says yes my elder sister and my younger sister they were also harassed and they'll come forward oh okay that's you've got a case yes my mom saw him harass me when i was seven eight years of ill you have a case but when you don't have any witnesses how would i know that you are not mentally ill and making up these stories i can't i can't say that you're telling the truth or you're a blatant liar therefore we cannot confirm what you're saying or denying it if you come forward with such an allegation and you fail to prove that that would be slandering and it would be a huge sin against your father let alone any other uh against any other person let alone your father which means that if someone slaunders me or slanders tom without providing proof he would be flogged 80 lashes and this is only to protect the whole community i sympathize with you i don't believe what you're saying is true and i don't say that it is not but without the proper evidence i would never ever dare and say a word against your father who might be a righteous practicing muslim totally unlike what you're saying and this is where the dilemma is you"
