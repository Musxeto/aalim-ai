  "transcript": "and we have uh jawad from emirates uh uh a brother at the masjid asked me a question uh he's trying to find uh a lease he's going to ireland inshaallah and he's signing a lease but his father is going to be paying for him so the person he's leasing from asked him for a letter a letter that's signed by his father saying that his father will pay for him and the person who is leasing the apartment asked for one witness and he didn't care if the witness was male or female is this an island um and the brother is wondering does he need to have the two islamic witnesses you know the two male or the one male and two female uh witnesses for this letter uh for his father saying that he has to that his father is going to pay on his behalf so is is the one who's leasing him accepting this paper whether there are witnesses or not the one who's uh leasing him is accepting it if there's at least one witness okay so okay i will answer inshallah jawad says about his father's paper testifying to be uh the one who pays for the lease if the landlord agrees to it and there is any witness according to his condition this is valid the paper itself is valid so there is no problem you don't need to have two male witnesses or one male and two uh ladies as long as the one giving it to you accepts it even if it says i don't need any witnesses just give me a paper that would be sufficient as well"
