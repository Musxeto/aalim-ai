  "transcript": "our beloved Prophet s. wasam was given the concise of speech what does that mean it means that he spoke so little yet whatever he spoke had so profound meanings that you would need chapters and books to go through it and explain the wisdom in it and this was not given to anyone other than the prophet for example there's no time for this sandwich little sandwich take it so may Allah be pleased with him he came to the prophet Alam once and he said oh prophet of Allah how can we survive how can we be saved now what is this question understood the true meaning of life how long will you live very few years then what inevitably death whoever thinks he's not going to die please raise your hands okay they're awake alhamdulillah no so everyone knows he's going to die but we live as if we're never going to die even the oldest of us the uncles you go to to them and you say how old are you Uncle he says I'm 90 Allah so how long more do you think you're going to live he said alhamdulillah I heard of a prophet I think his name is n they said he lived 950 yeah close so no matter how long you live you think no I still have a stretch a little bit more time and until the angel of death comes then give me 5 Seconds I have few debts I have to pay back I have a will to write I have to ask people I've wronged to forgive me No 5 Seconds only few minutes no I'd like to pray a prayer I missed no make up for a fast I did not fast give up some of the zakat I would was late in giving too late so this is what is happening at the moment understood all of this so he said show me the way out I don't want to be a loser I'm not a loser if I lose in my football match I'm not a loser if I fail one year in college I'm not a loser if I divorce and have a f marriage this is life I'm a loser if my grave is a pit of Hellfire I'm a loser when the Angels come and extract my soul from my body and I am punished by that I'm a loser when I fail to answer the questions in the grave oh there's a test in the grave yes everyone is going to be tested in the grave three questions oh three question is easy I'm going to answer those what are these questions what is your who is your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you easy Allah Islam Muhammad that's it this is easy now but in your grave you will only speak according to how you lived if you lived like a real Muslim yes you'll make it you passas everything is fine but if you did not live like a real Muslim and you had hypocrisy in your heart and you missed Salat and you missed and you fooled around and you cheated and you lied and you were not punctual on prayers when you are asked these questions in your Your Grave you will not be able to say other than huh huh I don't know I heard them say and I said what they said then the beating starts up the torment the punishment of Allah Asel is unlike anything you could imagine the angel would beat him with one blow on the head he turns into salt and he cries so loud that all inhabitants of Earth hears him except the gin and the humans all animals all insects all birds everyone hears this Cry of his because he failed to answer these questions so we want to know the way out what is the way out how can we make it it so the prophet saidat three statements and this is a concise of speech that he was given he said restrain your tongue and let your house be a sufficient shelter for you and weep over your your sin easy but it is easier said than done and if we will try to explain this Hadith in the 20 minutes I will not give it yeah it's fair amount of uh respect because this is a life strategy that the prophet is setting for us in what three statements six words it's mind-blowing nobody could come up with these things nobody could come up with such a life strategy in so short statements but so profound meaning re restrain your tongue what do you mean your tongue is a beast you keep your lips shut it's in its cage you guys know Safari huh I don't I didn't did not go to Safari I will never go inshallah I have National Geographic I don't know why people waste time anyhow put your beast in the cage you will be safe the moment you open the cage and let the Beast out what will happen Carnage it will beat eat and do heinous things your tongue is like this you tell me where do we use our tongues in and talk in what in VI no when we sit together what do we do let's revise the Quran no let's do anything beneficial nothing we talk about celebrities oh did you hear what she did did you see what he did they got divorced oh then they get married again and they divorced again oh did you see her dress did you see his suit wah his hairstyle is very nice tomorrow I'm going to go to the barber and do the same hairstyle I don't have any hair so alhamdulillah my hairstyle is the best topless anyhow so we gossip about Scholars did you hear what Sheik so and so well he's crap he's no good but shikh so and so refuted him and they started fighting and we talk ill about Scholars about diis we we talk ill about politicians oh he's corrupt he takes money from the drug lords he does this he does that we talk ill about our relatives about our loved ones about everyone So eventually what is your tongue doing Carnage it's destroying everything you see I can't help it when I see something in front of me and I don't try it so and forgive me I have to know is it coffee or tea okay yes Salam you can't afford this I can this is one of the advantages of being a Sheikh alhamdulillah you're treated like royalty so this is the problem with our tongues is it difficult to restrain yes or no no come on I'm going to eat and you don't want me have dinner no no no keep this is it difficult to restrain your tongue it is the most difficult thing to restrain to the extent that our Prophet saidat whomever wants me to guarantee J let him preserve two organs only two organs if you preserve them Allah will admit you to Jenna what are they your tongue and your private part and these are the most two organs in your body that will take you to Hell everywhere in the world your tongue does horrible things but it also can do Miracles imagine the impact of the word one word in Islam has great impact from kufur to Islam he's my brother he becomes a Muslim by saying what one word and the cfir by saying one word he makes fun of the Quran he makes a joke about Allah he makes jokes about Muhammad Alat wasam he comes out of the fold of Islam by by what one word a house is based on one word the father says I give you my daughter in marriage the young groom says I accept and two witnesses are Witness saying mashallah take your wife she's your wife and they have a family they have children alhamdulillah and they memorize the Quran and they become a very good Muslim family one word demolishes this house why didn't you put salt in the food I divorce you what did I do you broke your marriage he goes knocking on my door sh door she I am I was angry I don't know I have six children so if you have 10 children what is going to you said it you broke the the marriage by what a word that came out of your mouth this organ is very very dangerous now imagine if I am a singer songwriter if I am an atheist writing posts on Twitter or on Facebook or writing books casting doubts about Islam and about Allah Asel how much sins do I compile on myself but if I'm a Sheikh and I go around give dawa and remind people of Allah guide people to Allah teach people about Islam how much reward do I get so this organ is a double-edged sword it can slit your throat and it can fight in the cause of Allah so the prophet said restrain your tongue meaning from saying bad things not from saying good things good things set it Loose Let It Go the prophet says whoever believes in Allah in the day of judgment he should say good things or shut up very simple how many houses did we destroy by going to the wife and saying why are you accept acting this he's treating you like trash you should speak up for yourself you should stand up for yourself don't let him deal with you and treat with you like this and the husband comes from work tired and says alayum honey where's the dinner you go cook your dinner yourself he gets a heart attack divorce takes place how many times we went to the man said why are you being treated like a doormat allowing your wife to treat you like this stand up for your rights show her who the man is beat her up pull her hair she she has black belt in jiujitsu you crazy she was training with khabib I'm not going to do anything you go and do that to your wife I'm not going to do anything to my wife so at the end of the day what are we doing how do you turn this on okay never buy new things when you travel anyhow so your tongue is very very crucial for your safety if you restrain it from saying bad things you're in good hands otherwise you're going to suffer greatly the prophet saidat a man speaks with one word doesn't pay attention to it it will cause him to fall in Hellfire for 70 years before reaching the bottom 70 years you're going from medium rare well done you go 70 years you're being roasted like crazy and and and and this is not a joke Hellfire the least punishment in Hellfire is what yeah let's assume you smoke this is not a big sin I'm just harming myself I just smoke cigarettes if Allah wants to punish you he will place one stone of fire in your shoes you're out of hell HH only one stone of fire in your shoes your brain will boil from it what is happening to the rest of the body it will conduct heat to boil your brain this is not a joke one word does this for you the prophet saysat and let there be enough shelter for you in your house what the does that mean so many of us don't like their homes what are you doing I'm fed up I'm bored I want to go out and going out is permissible Halal if you're going out to earn money to feed your PE to feed your family to study this is halal but if you're just going out because you want to go out then we have a problem staying home is better than going roaming the streets and causing problems and fighting staying home is better than going to the market and to the malls and looking at women premixing and doing heinous things staying home is better than attending concerts or going to movie theaters or going to places where they do I don't know what do you callin in in in AR Arabia they do of you know the and and they're drinking but no coffee tea and what you're doing oh and and is like this like a frog so okay put it in both ways be a real frog not not one-sided this is mut what are you doing they work for 8 10 months to collect money and then they spend it in half an hour on K this is crazy so mallah after one session did you grow up biceps no did you get more intelligent a PhD maybe bachelor degree diploma no did you make any connection business-wise yes I will smuggle inshallah half a kilo and maybe crazy stay home the prophet is telling you staying home is better and the final so that we will open the floor for questions instead of wasting your time so much the prophet says and weep over your sins what does weeping mean to shed tears one says why excuse me why would I shed tears for your sins it doesn't make any sense come on I'm a grownup man I don't cry yes if you watch a romantic movie and the the the heroin dies or the hero is killed what will happen I wish I could save them I wish I was there I could have done something when you hear a romantic song and this and that and your heart is broken and you remember Khadijah or Z or whatever on the on the the on the tree next to the beach what happens to you you cry but when you hear hear the verses of Torment of hell when you hear the verses of Allah's greatness and Allah's Beauty what do you see what do you do nothing when you remember that you've done major sins minor sins in the millions what do you do shrug your shoulders and say nothing why because shatan has blocked your vision you can't see none of us can see their sins but we're very good in seeing other people's sins our sins we cannot see this once in a herd of camels you know camels you have camels here alhamdulillah they saw a camel laughing like crazy so they went to the Campbell and said hey why are you laughing so hysterically look at all the other camels yeah they have a hump on their back it's Subhan Allah du you have a hump on your back as well really can't see it but they look funny this is our problem we're good in detecting other people's sins we never reflect on our own sins why because in the car we're listening to music in the home we're watching TV in the office we're gossiping and reading newspapers and having breakfast mallah in your office is breakfast is from 9:00 until 1:00 when are you going to work this is what's happening in so many countries they don't work they don't produce so when are you going to contemplate about or upon your sins you don't pray night prayer you don't wake up at 3:00 and make tud and ask Allah for forgiveness and repent and weep over your sins this is why you live like this and you will die like this but when will you see your sins after death when it's too late these three statements of the Prophet Alat wasam you should learn them contemplate upon them if you want to be saved if you want the way out always remember restrain your tongue let there be a sufficient shelter for you in your home and weep over your sins uh how is the format of the questioning the brother has a microphone so I think you raise your hand he will give you the microphone you speak microphone ah you have to you have to grow up be strong we want to hear your voice in the recording see on the video you you're blushing why no no no we have want it public everybody has to see you and understand who you are what's your name yes sir okay the question the question what did you do the Americans have a saying if it's ain't broken don't fix it so it was working fine so keep it fine inshallah uh anyhow the brother is asking about the ruling on burying Muslims in Cascades and in in selling the Cascades to the Christians it is not permissible to assist other religions on their religious uh um rituals so anything that would assist others on their rituals is Haram for us to participate so what's the ruling on selling them a Christmas tree Haram what's the ruling on sending them lights Haram they have their own religion they can enjoy they can do whatever they want I don't assist them on it but if this is your question so let's assume my parents are Christians and they or one of them died is it permissible for me to attend my mother's funeral and burial the answer is no because they are doing this as part of their rituals and their religion my sister is a Christian she's getting married can I attend her wedding at church the answer is no yes she is my sister after the wedding is over and and so so on I can go and give her a gift in her house there's no problem participating in the rituals that are related to their religion is not permissible I hope this makes sense they are on the same what yes Allah didn't okay I will answer you inshallah but this is not very helpful okay hello no maybe do R okay no the allegation that you have brought forward is used by a a cult known as as and the most authentic opinion is that Al are not labeled as Muslims they are apostates because they reject the Quran while claiming to defend it how is that done they say we believe in the Quran and we reject the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam and we discredit anything that is not found in the Quran and usually they put forward the allegation that the scholars say that the Quran is incomplete have you ever heard any Muslim scholar say the Quran is incomplete yes or no any scholar who says the Quran is incomplete is a cafir Allah says Allah says today I have completed your religion but the Quran do not say that part of completing the religion is to believe in the Quran and to in the Sunnah and this is what is mentioned in the Quran in hundreds of places obey Allah obey the prophet and the people of authority so The Obedience of Allah Asel and The Obedience of prophet Muhammad is referring to the Quran and to the and this is why Allah says if you dispute over an issue always refer back to the Quran to to Allah which is the Quran and to the messenger which is the sunah and if you ask these qur you say that the de is complete he said yes the Quran is complete it doesn't need anything so they said yes Subhan Allah where do you find in the Quran that there are five prayers is two composed of one and two s and is for silent is for silent m is three two are loud and one is silent and Asha is four we don't find it but the culture and the people are doing it so we're doing it okay alhamdulillah where do you find in the Quran that zakat is to be given on cattle livestock gold and silver and crops that are grown from the earth with different percentages 2.5% generally 5% over crops if it is arrogated by you and 10% if it is irrigated through rainfall and rivers and for the livestock it's different five camels you give one sheep if you have 10 camels you give this much if you have 30 cows you give this cow if you have 40 you have a different cow if you have uh 40 sheep you have one sheep where is this in the Quran this is not authentic so they cannot undermine Islam so what do they do they disseminate it bit by bit if they speak about the Quran people will attack them and kill them so they say hm let's go a little bit lower let's talk about Sunnah let's let's try to refute Sunnah let's try to insult Sunnah and likewise insult the scholars the scholars don't know the scholars say that Islam is incomplete the Quran is incomplete they need this they need that and once we manage to do this we can also attack the Quran later on so a in response to your to your question this is very simple very crystal clear and with the grace of Allah no matter how they try they are speaking to deaf ears our ears are deaf with the beauty of the Quran and the beauty of the Sunnah and we will live strive and thrive [Music] in this is not me so so I turn off it's off turn it on what turn it on okay so I hope this answers your question El what what's the ruling on wearing the cap before praying so the question is what's the ruling on wearing the uh uh toppy or the cap before praying there is nothing in the Quran or in the Sunnah that recommends it or that says it's better or that says if you pray your prayer is less however it's a cultural thing so it depends on the culture on the people if the people 24 hours are wearing a head cover then it is best to wear it because it's a sign of prestige and dignity and honor but if the people all the time are not wearing anything only when they come to the Masjid they put this kuia or in some countries I saw a very weird phenomena they bring a handkerchief and they place it and they tie the four ends it's look like a drone and this is where the Drone came from and they looks it looks funny but they pray and afterwards they put take it off and put it in their pocket this is wrong this is not from the Sunnah and it's not from Islam to wear such a thing unfortunately if you go to their homes they will find that the father and the brothers Force the women folk their mothers and their sisters and their daughters to wear the hair cover why there's no n said no no no you have to do this you can't eat without wearing the hijab you can't go to the toilet without wearing the hijab you crazy so no if you don't do this the the angels will curse you who said this what religion is this Hinduism even the Hindus don't do this so these people are following a different religion than the religion of prophet Muhammad either prove it from Quran or Sunnah or leave us alone don't invent in our religion invent introduce hardship to people's lives without Del proof from the Quran and the Sunnah and Allah Knows Best of migrating migrating ah okay and ab ab is when you listen to the Quran you migration if you for example don't read Quran if you don't recite certain portion of the Quran over certain period of time you have M okay first of all the word Quran is not translated to migration because immigration and migration is to move from one country to the other the word you're referring to in Arabic abandoned and abandonment of the Quran as described by may Allah have mercy on his soul is divided into four or five categories so abandoning listening to it and most of us may do this unfortunately but to an extent so we believe in it we follow the instructions but we don't listen to it so this is partial then there is abandoning knowing it and learning it in addition but we still abide by the rulings of it and we believe in it then there is abandoning implementing it in our lives and this is dangerous and very critical then there is abandoning using it as a form of medication and healing so someone's sick and I when I came in the first day I came into uh Mombasa I fell sick and I had fever and throwing up and you cry on me I'm I'm a poor man get hold of yourself and the first thing I did water R and drinking alhamdulillah in 24 hours everything was fine I had a very bad stomach I could not eat anything and had fever and but with the grace of Allah I believe in the Quran so I did my R and everything was a okay then the last part of uh uh abandoning the Quran is the total enmity that you have towards the Quran you you feel agitated you feel that your chest is contrasting when you hear it you don't want to have anything to do with it may Allah protect us and Allah knows best ask question I just want to say I'm may Allah promote you to a split unit I want to ask if a woman is shy to say her can the father say for her of course this is a place of bargaining so the the woman is not comfortable in stating her Mahar and usually women don't say their Mahar yeah the man comes for the the first interview so that they can see one another he speaks she speaks about their ambition aspirations their uh future plans and there is chemistry between them she doesn't conclude by saying okay I'd like to have 10 million chillings as a Mahar say no this is too expensive what's your model I'm 2024 said no no no too expensive give us a discount 50% this is not done like this a woman is bashful she doesn't speak about these things yes after there is mutual yeah uh uh liking then they send their approval The Father's Side send his consent then they negotiate and the man says W he for my daughter we would expect to have X amount as di Mahar and usually around the people there's an average every country has an average so usually it's like $5,000 I don't know how much is it here more less I should be coming and visiting no alhamdulillah so usually it's $5,000 in Saudi it's like maybe 10 to $20,000 dowy it depends on the income on and if there is gold involved some countries they would say $1,000 in America maybe they would say anything but it has to be according to the norm of the people you don't want to take less so that they would not insult your daughter and you don't want to pay too much that would it make a burden for the others when they want to get married and Allah Knows Best either is it what an order if I read a medical journal for Mayo Clinic I get confused whether should I open my stomach when I have stomach ache to take away my appendix or no what should I do tell me consult a doctor that's why I'm here Allah says in two locations of the Quran why did Allah Place Scholars for us to ask you cannot come and simply understand the rhetoric of the Quran or the Sunnah if you did not do the necessary studies of Arabic language of of and go through the different scholarly opinions to understand and in it tells you an order which is do this is an indication of obligation unless there is another evidence reducing it from obligation to a recommendation and this is something that the scholars know you don't know so when you read the Quran Allah says when you are in the state of you're prohibited from killing the prey a game and you're not allowed to hunt Allah says in the Quran once you are Halal meaning you finished your you cut your hair go and Hunt so people after finishing OM inam they go and take their shotguns and they go look for game to shoot hey hey where are you going Allah says go and hunt this is command in Allah of Allah in the Quran no said this is an order it's an order a verb of order yes this is understood through that whenever there's a restriction and an order after it it takes you back to the status before the Restriction ah before the Restriction do not hunt what was the status if you see a game you can hunt it if you don't want to hunt it you don't hunt have to once you in your this is prohibition stop once the prohibition is uplifted it goes back to square one which is it's permissible you want to hunt or not so this is how you understand but if you don't have the necessary tools and studies you would not find it out I hope this makes sense abuse his sister one don't oh yeah having children after children yeah three four months how is it possible in three four months usually they take N9 months to have a baby okay child after child okay intervene and okay good advice the prophets gave us the advice it is a sign of a muslim's good Islam to mind his own business meaning it's none of your business tell your brother your friend this is none of your business his sister is happy yes he's a good man he's providing and uh I'm happy he's a good Muslim the man is happy he's very happy he likes to have children so what's the problem I don't want to see my sister conceiving every nine months none of your business when you get married don't conceive so this is yeah it's so problematic when you see people coming to me say she your beard is very big and if you trim it or make it it's none of your business it's my beard I'm the one who's shampooing it not you so why why do you care yeah but she it's too big it's too heavy did I ever complain did I tell you that my back is hurting because my beard is very big no so always take this Hadith as an earring with you mind your business don't intervene and interfere in people's lives when it's none of your business yes if you see something Haram you advise as part of enjoying virtue and righteousness and forbidding evil and vice this is an a religious obligation but when they're having children like this yes or no did the prophet encourage us to have as many children as possible so why are you opposing this there this is their problem if they want to use contraceptives or not this is their life and next time maybe you he will intervene he said okay missionary position or what come on Fe leave them alone they're happy leave them to their happiness and The Good Marriage inshallah the brother has a question speak speak yes yes brothers from the back how would I hear that question okay yes but Raise Your Voice okay I understand your question now so many times we're challenged if we want a job if we want to secure a place in the University if we want to win a contract of a company the people ask for a bribe so what's the ruling on giving a bribe the prophet saidat may Allah curse the one who gives a bribe and receives a bribe and another narration and the one interfering between them you the commissioner the one who's trying to facilitate things but this is a weak uh addition so if this is something that is your right or you're preventing harm from coming to you it is permissible meaning I bought a car from America my own money and it's this year's model I shipped it all the way to mumbasa I went to clear it from the customs and the cust agent was eating again can I have my car all the documents are there the bill of freight and I don't know what they call it and the custo I paid everything he said well you have to give something from under the table but this is Haram that Haram Halal I'm not going to give you your car if you want sue me go to the highest Authority I'm not going to give it to you is this my right yes this is my car I paid for it and he is standing in my way of clearing my car in this case if there is no other way I can give bribe and he will be cursed by Allah not me likewise if someone comes and says oh your restaurant is uh very nice mashallah if you don't give me this I will close it for you why you going to close it because I want money I have the authority I'm a government official I try to look and ask and help nobody is helping so yes I have to give him $500 and he will go away I have to give it now to get this job of yours is it your right no it's the right of everyone to get a contract is it your right no you don't have to get the contract go work somewhere where else and likewise so this is the criteria where you can justify giving a bribe from not giving one and Allah knows bestl usually don't say because of but in the neighb Coles nobody goes around and tells people I love you or knock knock on your neighbor's house say I love you no look expressing your care and your C feelings is how you act and behave so I don't go to a cafir and I say to him I love you but I deal with him in a nice way I send him some Busa and some uh shba maybe in Ramadan I when I cook something I give them as a gift when they need help with carrying heavy stuff I give them a l lend them a helping hand this is permissible but to express feelings of love and friendship to them out of the blue no the prophet says a man was sitting with the prophet Sall wasallam and another one passed by so the man said to the prophet oh prophet of Allah W I love this man so the prophet said did you inform him I said no said go and inform him this is is a brother a Muslim so we express our love to our Muslim brothers and I make you my witness that I love you all for the sake of Allah but don't come with me for dinner our love is from a distance huh so this is okay but to go out of my way to Hindus or Christians and say I love you they will they will look down at you they never come to us and say she I love you I hate your guts man I wish I can spit in your face but I can't you're too big they don't come so yes if some of them say oh neighbor you're a good neighbor I like you said I like you too no problem but you don't go out of your way and knock on their door and say oh this and that they would look very weird at you and Allah knows best where is this yes [Music] sir one wife is staying with him in Dubai and the other wife is staying in second what is the r on that kind of set where he in for months and comes back TOA for one two months and goes back to the other and the question comes back to the first question that brother from the front asked you about buing Muslim in the cofin you were kind of trying to answer that and was to part I wanted I was you en elaborate that particular say us the first of all when a person has two wives it's an obligation upon him to be fair in the following one the amount of time shared to the expenditure how much he spends on gifts and the likes so if his marriage was based on an agreement which is usually not the case his first wife is from Kenya and his second wife is from Dubai but he works in the Emirates because he has to earn a living so his wife cannot leave the kids and his family and his parents most likely she's living with them and come because of the expenses so out of convenience he had to get married so his marriage and the lack of Distributing the time is not due because he loves it and enjoys it rather due to inability to divide six month here and six month there so in this case it is permissible for him to live like this as long as he's dealing with Allah because the only one who judges him is Allah if he can spend more time with the woman in Kenia but he likes to spend it in Dubai because it's trouble-free she doesn't have kids kids and he's always having fun and she's young and she's probably Ukrainian he's got problems so this is question number one or the second wife which is the Kenan says you have card blanch go I need to see you only once a month one month a year alhamdulillah if she lets go of her rights that's very win-win uh uh case as for the coffins yes it is not permissible for Muslims to be buried in coffins as the case in America and Europe they have to be buried straight to the ground to the Earth wrapped in three shrouds like the Muslims facing the and buried in there and Allah Knows Best moon sighting this there is no opinion in it I know you're going to say a lot of controversy let me I don't like to speak about politics don't don't involve me I I still have 3 days after I leave ask me by the phone when I can say something I'm afraid of J I'm afraid of people are after me they want to kill me so you want them to make me c you want me to take sides no I'm not asking I'm asking what is your opinion okay I know your question I've been doing this for almost 23 years so when you start the question I know exactly what you want and I would save time so the issue is the Hadith of the Prophet when he said the day of your fasting as a nation is when you fast as a nation and the day to break your fast forid is when you break your fast forid what does this mean it means that the majority rules in the sense that if you have a religious Authority whatever the religious Authority say you follow so if your religious Authority the Muti the Islamic Ministry I don't know don't put us in politics I just want to leave and go home and if you have an Islamic Authority in your country they adopt moon sighting you follow them they adopt the sighting of meccah you follow them they adopt the astrological calculation no sighting no makah nothing okay from six years they know that today is Eid they announced it you follow them because this is what the Prophet saidham by this the Muslim is one um and they're following their religious Authority in a nutshell and Allah knows best and this is not my fatwa this is f so all the scholars of trusted Scholars say follow your religious Authority and you're in safe hands the office of the is the religious Authority follow him alhamdulillah alikum Salam I wanted to ask if a Muslim to Mar but one of the parents do not consent to this what should the boy do if he's still a boy let him stay home but if he's a man this is different why a when you come and want to get married and you don't have Financial independency you don't have a house you can't take care of your your wife then I will tell you don't get married because you don't have the means you need their consent they're going to provide for you they're going to help you they're going to assist you but if you're financially independent you have a job you have a re money income and you're able to take care of your wife and you found the right woman who checks all boxes islamically and she's religious she is Niki hijabi Punjabi I don't know whatever she has all boxes checked but your mother doesn't want her why oh she's too dark she's too white her hair is too fluffy her hair is too soft I this is not a logical reason so here you have to be diplomatic my mom I love her she's a good woman she's a good family but if she refuses you can marry her her without the consent of your mother or your father because you're a man but again if you're a boy stay home I don't have the microphone so you talk to him yes salamah the weather is fine we don't need a conditioners but alhamdulillah yes sir are you allow to perl are you allowed to drink perfumes in Islam if it contains alcohol no because it will intoxicate you okay he asked a legitimate question are we allowed to drink perfumes in Islam so if it contains alcohol or it is medically harmful it is Haram other than that drink as much as you want where are you yes sir have questions one well I don't know if they allow it one again y as you us your good can toen if you correct understood understood next year in when I come maybe next year imagine if I have one point I don't know how how many million followers on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and they each come to umra in jida sayam alaykum I love you for the sake of Allah I'm a big air conditioner can I come and meet you is it possible you think logically I can I meet people who are so many I know they love me and I love them back but I'm a human being yes they say that I am Captain America they say I'm a superhero but seriously I don't have time my time is very limited and likewise when it comes to invitations I cannot accept people's invitations though I appreciate it because I don't eat I don't have time to spend but the invitation is accepted I take a r check for that I'll give you my account if you want to send money then that's better as for your question the prophet saidat whoever wrongs a brother he must make it clear today in dun before the day of judgment because on the day of judgment there is no Dirham or dinar there is no money there is only good deeds and bad Deeds so this is the default you transgressed against a Muslim brother you have to seek his forgiveness I've and people come to me I back bit you and I said horrible things about you please forgive me no I'm not going to forgive you she Allah loves forgiveness yes I'm not going to forgive you why because I don't want to you speak ill about me why would I forgive you because then people would be encouraged you said oh he forgives people yal let's go no I'm not going to forgive you on the day of judgment Allah wants to forgive you I have no problem I want dinos I want compensation so you go to him and says I did wrong he doesn't forgive you or he asks money the scholars say even if he asks money you have to compensate him but here we have come to logic and wisdom if I go to the brother and I said I said something bad about you please forgive give me and he says what did you say I said it's not of importance no no you have to say it to me said okay I said that you're too short and too fat huh you said this and it causes more problem and a bigger FNA in this case no one says go and ask him for forgiveness no refrain what should I do I've committed a sin ask Allah to forgive him in your night prayer in your Dua and repent sincerely and show remorse to Allah on the day of judgment Allah will compensate him because of your true repentance Allah will give him good deeds from Allah's side and he will forgive you I hope this answers your question is it haram to watch enemy it depends on the content most most enemies have you know like manga and and passion fruit and they call it manga I don't know why they call it manga whatever who cares uh these cartoons they are made and designed by Japan and the cfer countries so they include the culture the idology of these countries which is Haram they have free mix they have excessive violence they have a lot of related issues of Allah and and the likes therefore it is not permissible but if there is manga that is halal that the content is halal like what Kanan the investigator what Kanan is name huh this is okay so many Muslims are addicted to it and it's all about crime and how to solve crime and this is fine inshallah there's no problem in it did you understand the question the answer will you repeat it then you did not understand it okay no problem my emplo islim he Amy fix every gu interest part of that interest is Muslim St is it okay no problem his sin is upon him your advantage is going for Haj for free alhamdulillah go you know the earning is Haram related to two Haram money is related to two things either the way it was earned or either to the actual money so the actual money if it is Haram it cannot be benefited or used how if I stole the money if I stole this bottle if I sell it if I give it as a gift if I die and inherit it to my HS it is still Haram money it can never change the nature of being stolen so it cannot be used earned money through Haram is different I'm a drug dealer and I make money from drugs so I have a million Shillings this million Shillings is Haram for me Haram money but if I give it to my wife to my children if I give it to you to make Hajj it becomes Halal to you so you see the difference so the money is Haram on your employer but when he gives it to you as a gift it becomes Halal for you inshallah try to go first class enjoy it while you can I cannot hear you riba is a an increased amount added to the loan so if I lent my friend money let's say $10,000 there is no conditions no stipulations no hints 10,000 he said I will return it to you next year 10,000 okay bah next year he came and said this is your $10,000 and this is $1,000 a gift from me no problem this is a gift but if I lent him the money for his business and I said this is your $10,000 yeah if you make profit don't forget us this is riba if he hinted that I will give you when I return the money I'm going to give you a gift I said no you want to give me a gift I'm going to keep my money this is RBA so no no I'm not going to give you a gift we have agreed upon that and when he brings the loan back he gives me a gift it's permissible I hope this clarifies it in so if buys a house on a mortgage and he fulfills he makes all this interest money he pays all this interest and then he sells the house and he makes a profit off of it this interest based house the profit is he allowed to use it in his further transactions or would he have to dispose it the Haram in mortgage money is in paying the bank interest so when you borrow a million and you pay them back 1.2 the million the capital which you bought the house with you paid them fully it's your house so the sin is in eng engaging in RBA by giving them the 200,000 extra so when you sell the house later on you're sinful for the money you gave to the bank but the house is yours so if you sell it for 1.52 million it's the money is halal but you're still sinful for the point2 that you've paid for riba stop me he's saying that we have to Doan what it's cold yes okay first of all when you are forced to take interest money from the bank over your savings because some countries whether you put current account saving account no matter what account they will give you interest whether you like it or not I think this is also applicable in India to my knowledge so in this case the interest money is Haram money you cannot benefit from it you cannot utilize it so you have to take it and dispose of it without having any um interest or anticipating any reward from Allah when you give this money to your wife as a allowance or to your children you're hitting two birds with one stone because you have to give your wife allowance whether you like it or not so instead of giving it from your free Halal money you give her from Haram money this is not permissible at all and Allah knows bestum he said the last question this the least question okay anyone with last questions as well yes this is the question okay about how is done Are there specific readings you supposed to read what time are you supposed to pray and how will you know if it is answer or how will you know if whatever you asking this right would you like me to also describe Eid prayer one question you're making a lecture now in a nutshell in a nutshell what is it it is asking Allah to facilitate this not to choose which one to take I have an interest of buying a car Ya Allah should I buy the 911s Porsche or should I go for the Ferrari Roma I don't know Ya Allah I am hesitant I don't know which one to take so I say I pray and ask Allah it doesn't work this is not right huh is to make a decision okay 911 is a practical car it's a day-to-day car I can go to work I can go to Ledger it has launch control it's excellent rating it's best car I'm going to take 911 I made my mind now I pray two what do I do the two Ras must be from out of the F it has to be voluntary after praying two ra I raise my hands and I do the Dua which you know in the Muslim Fortress of Muslim translates to oh Allah praising Allah praising Allah then if buying the 911s is good for me in this Dunya and in the Hereafter in all of my Affairs oh Allah facilitate it for me and if not oh Allah decline it and put something better for me and make me satisfied make my heart happy with it I go to the showroom with my checkbook I'm determined I want to buy this car were welcome they bring me coffee the coffee is cold no problem and after that I want the car to be in gray color said oh oh gray color we don't have it in stock we have red but gray color you have to wait 6 months what will happen to me I don't no no six months crazy I'll go to the next showroom I'll get a red Ferrari Roma number one this is my's answer oh don't have to see a vision a dream no don't I have to see a window open from the heavens and you know lanterns and coming down as a or something do I have to see a sign because when I'm going to the agency of the car I saw a dead cat so oh this is myar answer all of this is nonsense there is nothing Asar answer you're asking Allah if there's good in it facilitate it Allah did not facilitate it it's not good for you okay last question I don't know ask ask them don't ask me they will kick me out no see who that"
