So like um I know like you have said that like if someone get like too uh get confused like too much whether like he did like first sujood or second he should like act on his gut feeling so like what if like the gut feeling is like 55 percent or like 45 uh like 55 to 45 uh and what should I do then it's not an issue of percentage it's an issue of two scenarios number one you are totally blinded you are unable to decide whether I did one or two whether I prayed three rakahs or four rakahs in this case the prophet tells you alaihissalaam to cast the doubt I'm not sure I prayed three or four what is the doubt number four I'm not sure I made one prostration or two what is the doubt the second prostration so act as if you only offered one and add to it another one this is when you're totally confused 50 50 if you have a gut feeling which is 51 percent this is my second or 51 percent this is my first act upon it one percent more than the 50 percent is a gut feeling act upon it and offer your prostration of forgetfulness after the salam you make salam then you offer two prostrations and then you offer another salam and allah knows best"
