  "title": "Will I be in the same level of my relatives in Jannah?",
  "transcript": "Omar from Lebanon. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh I just had a question about you know when in Jannah there is evidence from the Sunnah that a person will be back with his family so they will be gathered in the same level in Jannah. But I wanted to know the extent of this like for example Prophet Muhammad ﷺ he will be with his wife in the same level and most if I'm not mistaking his children but his grandchildren if they are also righteous will they also be in the same level and how long does this extend like in the lineage line so after the grandchildren the children of the grandchildren and so on and so this also applies to like normal families. Okay first of all Akhi Omar this is way above your and my pay grade. Now it's like coming and questioning the government for their housing distribution and Allah has the highest example. You don't have the authority to go and question the Prime Minister why did you give housings for free for those and not for us and why did you put us in this neighborhood and not in that neighborhood. This is according to the preference and the planning of the government. Now Allah has the highest example. We are told that وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُمْ بِإِحْسَانٍ حَقْنَ بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ Those who believe and their offspring also believers we made their offsprings catch up to them. So whether the offsprings are caught up with their parents or the parents are caught up with their children this happens in Jannah. To what extent this is in Allah's hands. We don't have to read between the line, accept it as it is on the day of judgment we trust Allah. The question is and this is what the one million Kuwaiti Dinar question. Is it difficult for Allah to put everybody in the same level? Of course not. But is this what's going to happen? I have no idea. I know that Allah promised us to be satisfied unconditionally. I believe in that and let's stop here."
