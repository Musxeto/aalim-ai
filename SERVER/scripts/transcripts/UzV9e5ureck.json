  "transcript": "Haram earning has two sources Haram because of the way it was earned and Haram because of the nature of the thing earned explain I this is scary but I have someone behind me to catch me no I don't want to die now maybe later but not now okay someone working in a r based Bank R Isam someone is working in the Customs so everybody gives him under the table bribes because they don't want to pay customs they want to smuggle things bribes are Haram someone who sells Haram uh intoxicants cigarettes movies uh inappropriate uh magazines income is Haram this is Haram due to the nature of earning the money so I am the earner the money is Haram for me I go home I give my wife my children my relatives I see sheim and I give him a million Shillings H is this money Halal for them yes but it is Haram for me so the wife can take the money and eat with it buy clothes with it because it transformed into Halal once it was given the second type of Haram money is Haram for the nature I stole this it's Haram for me it's stolen I gave it to my wife it's Haram for my wife why because it's not hers yeah but my husband gave me yes he gave you something he does not possess and own it's Haram she gave it to her children it's Haram the children gave it to their grandparents it's Haram Haram money meaning stolen money can never be cleansed or Changed by transferring it from one possession to the other Haram earnings can and the the evidence is the Jews consume RBA and they consume Haram wealth by cheating others when a Jewish woman invited the prophet Alat wasam to aam that she cooked for him the prophet answered her invitation and ate did not ask this is he ate because if it's Haram for her it becomes Halal for me to consume and Allah knows best someone is asking someone died in with cancer 2 days of fasting so how would their children pay the fasting that she in if a person dies leaving Days that he did not make up we look at this person if he fell sick and died before recovering and was unable to make up for the M dayss because he was continuously sick for 1 month two months 3 months and he we say nobody compensate or make up for these days why because Allah Asel forgives this but if a person was sick he skipped 5 days of Ramadan two months later he was healthy he could have made up these 5 days but he didn't he waited for five six months and died in this case these five days are a debt that we have to to pay on behalf of the debt by his heirs Sons daughters husband or wife depending on the gender they make up for these days and they can divide if he has five children each one fasts one day these are five days alhamdulillah can we pay money or fidya it depends if his illness was chronic and doctors say he could never ever fast to make them up the answer is yes but if he had the chance and the ability and he was lazy or late no you cannot pay for it and Allah knows best someone is asking in an arranged marriage a Muslim man his wife not her or should he stay because of the kids if if what married yes the Muslim tell not to be love loving his wife he doesn't love his wife yes she doesn't love him okay so he's asking can he because he does not love her can he divorce her because he does not love her this is stupid with all due respect do you think all those who are married love their wives of course no no the definition of love what is it it's not Hollywood nor Bollywood nor Nollywood I've heard this recently they have Bollywood in India and Nollywood in Nigeria I hope they don't have Hollywood in Kenya inshallah that's is a problem W so they think that love is when I go after 20 years or 30 years of marriage enter the house oh my husband oh my wife and we exchange kisses and emojis and heartbeats and and flowers and hey you crazy after 5 days of marriage all of this is gone there's nothing like this what remains is the respect the compassion the mercy the kindness the care and this is much much much more than love because you can love someone in 1 hour and leave them this is not love this is physical attraction it is not the love you're talking about so once you're married in an arranged marriage look at the wife you have or the husband you have whether they check all the boxes or not most likely they check 90% of the boxes 10% nobody's perfect but Shan focuses on the 10% ah your spouse is it's not what the one you want when you get this go to a closed room turn on the lights and stand in front of a mirror and look deep into yourself how many boxes do you check whoo I don't check any boxes sh and she's still living with you she's accepting you for how bad you are do this and smell your breath it is worse than the garbage can when was the last time you took a shower Ramadan people have odor when they don't shower you have o deer she's accepting you and you're not Ellen musk mallah you're throwing dollars all over the place you have a very tight budget every time where did you spend this how much did you spend it show me the invoices why did you do this turn off the lights the room nobody's in there turn off the lights turn down the AC so you have so many bad things in you and she's accepting you and she loves you and she respects you and now you say well I don't have love go divorce her let her marry a real man who would protect her who would love her who would take care of her and you go marry someone from Hollywood Bollywood Nollywood kwood and then look how she would torture you humilate you insult you and make a scandal of you everywhere and she and then you come to Sheik for counseling session you have to pay $110 H is it allow to have it is it allowed you to have a to the to have a what i a what girlfriend a girlfriend a girlfriend yes if you allow your sister and your daughter to have once it's okay do you allow her why oh my my sister no nobody can take her as a girl for marriage it's okay no of course not she I'm offended the hell with you who cares if you're offended or not you want to do to other women's what you don't want people to do to your own women fear Allah if you are serious no one asks whether it's okay to take a girlfriend because if you take a girlfriend tomorrow when you have daughters they will take boyfriends your sister will go out with someone you don't approve of or even those you approve of and it would Cod you C cause you to be have to have your reputation tarnished and you have have a scandal there is no except on the Quran and the Sunnah and ask this to any scholar is it part of the to have girlfriends boyfriends huh of course not but my intention is to get married even though if you want to get married you have to knock the door of the house not come from the back door or from the window and what you're doing no one approves of it or allow it and definitely Quran and Sunnah does not allow any of this asking if my parents Muslims and they deceased can I pray for them unfortunately not in Muslim the prophet once while passing by Al which is an area outside of Medina he cried so the companion said why are you crying o prophet of Allah he said I asked Allah to seek forgiveness from my mother and Allah prevented me from doing so and I asked Allah to grant me permission to visit her grave and Allah allowed me to visit her grave and in Surah atba chapter 9 Allah Asel stated that it is not permissible for the prophet or to the Believers to ask forgiveness for their relatives relatives if they died on shik so this is not permissible and Allah knows best is asking fasting but not praying is is his F accepted if a person fasts but he does not pray at all and there is a difference between someone who prays on and off pray two three uh not three two three prayers a day and someone who does not pray at all and when you say to him come and pray said I don't pray someone who does not pray at all not one single Salah he's a c full-fledged with a big bag say kafir k a f i r not kafur kafur is Supermarket is cfir someone who prays on and off he's in great danger some Scholars say he's a kafir but the majority say he's still Muslim but a very very very bad Muslim so someone who does not pray at all if he fasts goes for Hajj gives zakat it will all be rejected on the day of judgment and not accepted Allah says all what they have come with of Good Deeds is all in vain brother saying I have an issue he mostly watches bad things at night so he's asking how can he quit because it leads into even doing bad things with himself watch it in the morning so Subhan Allah part of is to be observant and aware of Allah watching you yeah when you sit whether in day or night and you watch pornography Oran comes and say pornography no picture is okay and sometimes if you're strong in IM nud pictures is Haram uh model pictures is okay it's Haram uh small Clips you know funny reals this is how Shan starts step by step watch a movie clip innocent nothing Haram a little bit further maybe some nudity a little bit further a lot of nudity a little bit further pornography a little bit further you're addicted if you knew that Allah is all hearing all seeing Allah is watching with you would you watch but you are sealed your heart is sealed is covered you don't ever remember that Allah is watching me Allah is hearing what I'm hearing so this means that you have to go back to stage and to square one where you study the beautiful names of Allah to know that Allah is all of these tell you that Allah is watching you Allah is holding you to account this would help you whether you do it at in the day or in the night it doesn't make a difference now how to stop it get rid of your stupid your smartphone this is one of the means that take you to Hell iPad laptops computers get rid of them she I have to do work I have to do school no problem use a PC with a big screen and put the screen in the living room not facing the wall facing everybody else so when you sit to work the screen is facing everybody everybody can see oh sh but maybe something will come and maybe I will see something that is inappropriate that's good now you will stop but when you keep hiding you put secret codes and PIN codes and protection and hide everything why because people will find it and see it but Allah knows about it it's okay Allah knows about it it's okay but I don't want my father and my mother to know I don't want my IM of the Masjid to know then you have a serious problem in your in your IM and this is why you're not on the straight path of may Allah protect us all if your parents are in sh not let them know anything about your life but keep the can we what if their parents are on sh yes can you not let them know anything about your life but keep the T no why would you hide things of your parents if they are on shik what is the end result of what you want I want them to be guided I want them to come to is hiding things of your private life of your work of your marriage of your children will improve your relationship with them of course not you judge things by the conclusion if they are on shik focus on bringing them back toed how giving them lectures it doesn't work you have just come out of the egg to them you're still small and you are preaching us and giving us da and giving us lectures about they will not accept this let them love you let them respect you by showing them that I'm beautiful I'm respectful I am obedient I'll do anything to please you without talking to them as if you are in an ivory Tower this is Haram this is sh you will go to hell you no come down and make make them feel that you are their servant and you want them to be happy once they acknowledge this and believe in you and love you when you tell them Father Allah says in the Quran this what do you understand he will understand but when you come and no this is Haram she so and so says it is shik you will go to hell you will never be saved on the day of judgment they will not accept this so think of the conclusion what do you want to achieve not on little things should I tell them that my son went to uh college should I tell them that I had I I got a raise in school in my work or I bought a new car this has nothing to do with their shik and Allah knows best saying I have a business where I make romantic for couples is it if I do non-muslim couples too since it may lead them to do Isam what kind of questions is this Allah says in the second Ayah of chapter five if you assist someone to do Haram Muslims or non Muslims then you're sinful you'll get the same sin if they are mad married and they want you to decorate their room and they're married according to their religion and you decorate the room no problem but if you know that he's not married or he wants to have red kns and and wild nights in Haram of course you cannot ever assist him on that someone is asking about multi marketing and is it multi-level marketing or the pyramid scheme or the Ponzi scheme is where you target the base of the pyramid you try to collect as many as you can who would pay something that would make the following level richer and the following level would pay the level above above above until the one on top is gaining this pyramid scheme or multi-level marketing is not based on realities they tell you we want you to sell this card what is it oh we have only 500 cards of it what does it do oh it does wonders it doesn't do anything but let's assume or we have this bundle of software and books uh and computer programs okay very good how much it cost 10,000 Shillings and if you sell it you get 10% and and if you recruit those who you sold it to so that they sell it to another five people these five people would add to your credit 1% of these 10,000 and likewise so you start selling but before you start selling you have to do what you have to buy so you're buying the software and you're buying the programs and the books not because you want to use them rather because you want to be enlisted in this scheme a brother came to me with his supervisor in this multi marketing uh scheme and he said sh it's is good it's Halal product I said what did they sell you he said he they sold me a golden uh pen how much he said 2,000 R I said okay what Mark is it a brand is it something it's rubbish 400 this sold it for 2,000 they got 1,600 in their own pocket they give you percentage they give them percentage and they're still making money and you're fooling others to do the same he said you're right this is Haram the fat was of Scholars is crystal clear all the products they sell are overpriced and it's a condition that you buy in order to enlist which is totally Haram like ask about trading in Bitcoin is it har or well I had an an old video I don't even remember what I said in it four years ago five years ago about Bitcoin you can see it the essence of Bitcoin is it's not a real currency maybe maybe now in Austria it is legalized so if it is legalized under the authority of the Central Bank of the country that that regulates it that puts regulations that you don't be fooled or or uh uh stolen your money and it becomes regulated like currency yes now as we speak it is not anyone can hack and we always hear in the news $2 billion doll have been stolen from Bitcoin or cryptocurrency or this or that why well they hacked into the computer and they took the hard Drive the one forgot his password this the money is gone and people a lot of the people why would they be interested in cryptocurrency because of the rise and fall so they say we can make easy money but what comes easy huh goes easy ask most of those who traded in cryptocurrency they would say well we've lost so much but inshallah we will gain and they keep on this false hope that they will gain and they never gain so yeah until it becomes regulated authorized by the country central bank then it is still Haram many questions about trading Forest same old question every time I come to Kenya people ask me about Forex you guys don't have a job don't you have a life all you Forex why well because we enter and we buy and then we sell and then we buy and we what did you buy I don't know what did you sell what I had stocks what companies I don't know all what Forex is doing is something digital stock market in Kenya you go to the bank you buy stocks in XY Z company does XYZ exist yes you can go to their premises you can see their factories you can see their machines and you can see their trucks they exist so when I buy their stocks I am a partner this is real but in Forex It's All Digital you buy day trading early morning in the afternoon you sell and a lot of those who deal in Forex don't deal with their own money I have $10,000 it's mine I buy stocks in this company and the stocks fall I will not sell I will keep it for two months until it goes up and I sell it Halal as long as the stocks are Halal the problem is that when you come to Forex they say how much you have $110,000 good we'll give you $90,000 extra I have $100,000 yes we trust you you trade $100,000 wow I have lots of money if I make this profit I will make start buying here buying here buying here the $100,000 that you bought stocks with the stocks fell down 95 94 93 all of a sudden someone overrides you and sells the whole stocks hey why did you sell because you were losing yeah but 93 I still have $3,000 said no the $3,000 is our profit we saved our $90,000 and took your 3,000 so now you lost the 10 10,000 some of them Buy on margin some of them buy uh uh with with so many riba and ambiguity and and and and forwarding and and the likes all of this is Haram only Halal is when you have your money you buy stocks in halal companies with your money and no one forces you to sell whenever you want to sell inshallah after two years it's yours it's there this is halal but you cannot deal with gold silver or currency on online business at all this is riba gold silver and currency it has to be physical simultaneous take and give and Allah Knows Best say how can I be an obedient child my pars by not disobeying them H sometimes you ask questions online yeah come on how can I be an obedient Child by obeying them what what do you want me to say and reinvent the wheel saying when we save our money in a GS account in G in an Islamic B they usually give us per month I have a feeling it's what is the way for this has to do with is this Islamic Bank really Islamic number one if they say yes they have a Shar board that overlooks all the transactions and they're formed of Scholars and said okay number two the account you're opening and let's assume it's a saving account and or a fixed a deposit account where you put your money and they trade they take your money and they invest in stocks they build a a building and rent it and sell it and they get and give you the profit if the Shar board is overlooking this is halal when do we know it's Haram when they tell you every month you will get a fixed 1,000 shilling every month this is riba any fixed amount of money as profit this is RBA oh she but one of my friends told me give me $5,000 and every month he gives me $500 profit this is riba anytime the capital is secure she another friend told me give me $5,000 for investment and I will give you monthly profit but if the business loses I guarantee you will receive your 5,000 back this is RBA because it's a loan you lent him 5,000 the interest is the prophet is giving you every month and whenever there's a loss he gives you back your loan business is profit and loss you have to share the loss if you don't then there is no Halal in it and Allah knows I think because of time the last question [Music] question now this question I always get is fading Haram the haircut so the Hadith we have number one the prophet prohibited Al what is Al is to shave one part of the head and leave the other the Mr T hair cut where he puts this Mohawk and shaves here this is Haram what the Marine American US Marine do they shave the sides and keep the top Haram the Friars you know the the French uh Catholics in their uh churches they shave this area and keep the rest of the hair this is also Haram the other Hadith is whoever imitates a people he is part of them so someone doesn't shave but he has a fate he has a certain way of lining his head like Drake mean or like Rihanna or I don't know these guys names huh they have a certain thing because the africanamerican movie stars or celebrities people look up to them so oh he's the brother he's like us he's from from us we look like him this is Haram you're a Muslim you have your dignity you have your honor you don't imitate anyone other than the prophet Muhammad Alat wasam so leave your hair all of it or shave it all or when you want to have it little have it all on the same degree little faith is okay what do you mean yeah if you do number four here and number three here this is not a fate this is usually that when even you go to the barber he cuts short a little bit here but to have it skin and obvious that this guy is mAh is a you rapper and do this and do that no this is not permissible to imitate the disbelievers and Allah knows best okay time is 8:15 so we have 15 minutes and does your wife break does my wife break my woodo I've been married for 41 years what do you mean she doesn't even obligate alhamdulillah okay now on a serious note uh she's part of my body now if I kiss her or kiss my hand it's the same impact listen to me uh the concept of touching the opposite gender is only found in the shaf where Imam sha used to say that touching the opposite gender whether your sister your Maham your wife breaks your woodoo the other Scholars and schools of thought say it does not break your woodo because Prophet Muhammad Al used to sit in his home before going to Salat he used to kiss his wife AA and go without renewing his woodo so this means that touching your wife kissing your wife does not impact the woodoo inshallah and Allah knows best so I think because we've announced that that be the last question my brother if he allows you I'm okay what uh what if uh What uh one of the older people they and I will not look at you huh I know I'm scary that's what my wife says but Manish huh J what if what if the old the people they're wearing gold and then tell them to remove the gold but then they refuse okay if Elders do Haram what is our responsibility number one to be respectful number one to be diplomatic number one to also give them the ruling because we fear that it would may take them to Hell be respectful diplomatic so if you go and see your father wearing gold this is your question and you tell him father there is a Hadith I read in Ali where the Prophet said alham these are Haram for my male men and Halal for the women and he held silk and gold what does it mean Baba and the father would explain to you and he knows you did your job you don't go and say ah but you're wearing gold and you will go to Hell Fire what do you expect him to do he will slap you so you have to be wise you have to be diplomatic you have to be polite when you speak to the elders and if you don't then you have committed a more major sin and Allah Knows Best"
