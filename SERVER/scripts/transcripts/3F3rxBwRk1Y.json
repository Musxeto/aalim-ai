  "title": "Understanding the Concept of Predestined Destiny",
  "transcript": "Allah has predestined our destiny, what will happen to us 50,000 years before creating the creation. As the Prophet ﷺ said, when Allah created the pen, Allah said to the pen, write. The pen responded, what should I write? Allah said, write everything that will take place until the Day of Judgment. The Prophet ﷺ says, this was 50,000 years before creating the creation, the universe. So once you know that everything was predestined, once you know that Allah owns everything and Allah is not stingy, Allah is the most generous. Once you know that nothing prevents Allah Azza Wa Jal from doing what He wills, you raise your concerns and worries only to Him. You ask and beg only Him, not being doubtful but being certain that He will respond to you. The Prophet ﷺ said, ask and supplicate to Allah with a heart filled with certainty for Allah does not respond to a person that asks Him while being neglectful. Therefore, if you have concerns, raise them up with Allah Azza Wa Jal and have full trust, dependence and reliance only on Him and He Azza Wa Jal will be as you think of Him. If you think of Him positively, Allah Azza Wa Jal would facilitate your affairs. May Allah facilitate all our affairs."
