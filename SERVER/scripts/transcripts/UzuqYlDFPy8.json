  "title": "Is it sinful if I distance myself from the Masjid during prayer time to continue my activity üòè?",
  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu If I'm out somewhere doing my own activities, I know that if it's a prayer time and a mosque is nearby, then I have to attend the congregational prayer. What if I'm hanging out in the forest, for example, and the distance between me and the mosque makes me obliged to pray in the mosque, but just a few minutes before the prayer time is due, I distance myself away, so I would not be obliged to pray in the mosque. And I do this on purpose, so I don't need to stop my free activities and go to the mosque. Is there any sin with this, Sheikh? Yes, there is a sin in this, because you are doing it purposely to skip the Salat. It is like someone who knows it is Asr Salat in half an hour, and he orders his wife to bring him onions and garlic to eat with the food, so that he would smell offensively to those who are worshipping Allah in the masjid, and hence he has a legitimate reason. You do not fool Allah Azza wa Jal with such a trick. If you are in the forest or you're outdoor and you're far away from the masjid, yes, you have a legitimate reason to skip the Salat in the masjid with the congregation. But when you are within the vicinity, and a few minutes before the Salat is due, you distance yourself away from it, no, this is not permissible."
