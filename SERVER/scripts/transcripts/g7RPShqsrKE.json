  "transcript": "Iman from Pakistan um there is a girl in a drama in a movie who wear bracelet and she it has been showed that she believed that it will prent it will prevent her from evil eye and difficulty is it uh sh and if it is then if I enjoy only scene and acting of actors not that bracelet which is wor by her is it similar to enjoying sh kuur because in that scene she wears it all the time it is not permissible for a Muslim to watch such dramas or films or soap opas or TV series due to the Haram things that are involved free mixing women not wearing the proper attire and hijab music lying and in this case shik so if the belief that wearing such a dress or an amulet or a protects her this is SH now when you watch it if you don't have the conviction and the belief and you know it's wrong this is not kufur from your side or shik but it's still sinful so definitely you have to refrain from doing this and Allah Knows Best"
