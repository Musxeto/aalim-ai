  "title": "Masjid combines prayers even when there is LITTLE rain, am I obliged to pray in a different Masjid",
  "transcript": "Hamza from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Sheikh, the masjid near me joins Maghreb and Isha even when there's a very, very small amount of rain. So I know that this isn't correct, but what should I do? And should I pray Isha with them? And is it obligatory for me to go to a different masjid for Isha? Jazak Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum. If the masjid combines between Isha and Maghreb without a legitimate reason, and unfortunately some of the imams are so lenient and soft that they go against the sunnah. So they say, no, no, no, the Prophet ﷺ did this, Ibn Abbas did this, and ordered us to do this because the Prophet ﷺ did it, blah, blah, blah. The scholars put a condition when it's heavy rain, when there's mud, then there's hardship. But if it's not that heavy, then you're not allowed to combine. So for you as an individual, you estimate. If you see that this is not a legitimate reason, then pray Maghreb with them and leave. And if there's a masjid nearby in the vicinity, you go and pray Isha there. And if there's no masjid, then you pray in your home and Allah knows best."
