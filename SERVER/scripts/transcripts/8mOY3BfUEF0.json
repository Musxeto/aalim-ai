  "title": "ðŸ†• Muslims who prefer Bless You Instead of Yarhamuk Allah when I SNEEZE? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The first question is from Hamza. He says when we know that when we sneeze we say Alhamdulillah and a Muslim who hears us says Yurhamukumullah. But lots of the Muslims nowadays don't know this nor do they want to learn it. So when we say Alhamdulillah after we sneeze they just say bless you. Should we say Ameen or thanks in this situation or what else? As a Muslim we have to abide by the Islamic rulings and we have an identity. Those who refuse to adhere to our identity, to our religion, we don't care about them or how they feel. So when I sneeze and I say Alhamdulillah and someone says bless you or Gesundheit, I look at him and I say Akhi in Islam the Prophet said Alayhis salatu Wassalam. When someone sneezes he should say Alhamdulillah and those who hear him must say Yurhamukumullah. So your reply should be Yurhamukumullah. If the man learns this and implements it and thanks you Alhamdulillah. It's a win-win. If he's arrogant and an ignorant imbecile and he waves his hand and says I don't care I just would say Gesundheit or bless you. I don't want to say what you've just stated. Don't even reply to him. Don't even look at him when he says bless you. Don't even reply to him because he does not deserve to be respected. Such ignorance. Yes if a non-Muslim says bless you say thank you. There's no problem in that but a Muslim you have to teach them whether they like it or not. you"
