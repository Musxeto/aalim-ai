  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode with another Hadith dealing with the livelihood with the p with the health of the hearts in the hadiths of the Prophet Alam in theah of the Prophet AB alari may Allah be pleased with him says that the prophet sallallah wasallam once said to him oh Abu do you think that having a lot of wealth is richness I replied yes oh messenger of Allah then the prophet saidat do you think that having little wealth is poverty and I said yes oh prophet of Allah then the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam said true richness is the richness of the heart and true poverty is the poverty of the heart in this Hadith the prophet Alat is correcting our glasses our specs that we see things through so he is changing our understandings and our perspectives of Life normal people would think that riches richness is to have a lot of money poverty is to be Stone broke the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam corrects this and he says that the actual and true richness is the richness of the heart and the actual poverty is the poverty of the heart in another narration also this narration is authentic it's in bukari and Muslim the prophet said richness is the richness of the soul and they're interl because the heart is the master of all and the Soul lives inside the heart as some Scholars said and usually the soul that desires things is usually in constant battle and struggle with the heart and if the heart manages to control things and to have a grip over things then we're fine the Hadith says in Arabic do you think that having a lot of wealth is richness the word is a noun the adjective is and even one of Allah's beautiful names is Alani and this name or adjective has two meanings the first thing that comes into mind is richness wealth money when in reality means to be self-sufficient not to need anyone and of course with Allah it's a whole different story because Allah is the one is the first without a beginning and the last without an end there was Allah and there was nothing with him so he's the self-sufficient he's the actual true and of course he has everything everything in his hands so he is also the rich and the wealthy that if he were to give all his creatures what they ask for nothing would have been missing of his wealth subhanahu wa ta'ala haar may Allah have mercy on his soul said one of the Great schol of Islam said the Hadith means that the actual richness is not having a lot of money because a lot of the rich are not satisfied with what they have and therefore they strive over and over again to have more and more not caring where it's coming from whether from Halal or Haram and because of their striving to have more it seems as if they are actually in poverty Because the actual richness is when you are self-sufficient when you're satisfied with what you have when you are content and you don't work hard to get more or to strive or to go out of your uh your way to gain more and more because you are rich in the sense that your heart is content Imam says the actual richness that benefits an individual or can be praised for it is the richness of the S of the soul and of the heart because once you are self-sufficient you would not look at what people have in their hands you would not feel eager to be awarded or giving something sometimes you find individuals associating themselves with the rich and the powerful with the people of authority so they're always looking at what they have they're always hopeful and Wishful that they may throw something like a bone to a hungry dog so they always look at their wealth at their positions at their cars at their valuables hoping that maybe they'll throw them a bone and when you're like this you lose all type of dignity all types of Honor you would no have no Integrity nobody would praise you or compliment you rather you'll be resented and looked down upon because you're their dog and that is why everyone would start to insult you and you'll be humiliated and this is what we see with those who are always boot licking and Aster as Aster kissing this is what's happening when they associate themselves with the rich and the powerful always in their Entourage they would always suffer because their souls and hearts are looking eagerly to get a bone of them while these powerful and influential and Rich would not do that unless they want to and unless they milk you for whatever you have the conclusion is the one who has a rich heart is always content and satisfied with what Allah has given and this what makes him rich and those on the other flip side who are poor in their hearts and souls will always be eager for more never content with whatever they have and they are always in depression and sorrow and they're always complaining because they think that they are deprived from Allah's favors and blessing though Allah has given them everything and look and compare the most wealthiest man man on Earth who has hundreds of billions of dollars and look at his family look at his lifestyle look at his face you can see the darkness and look and compare to him someone in gazah who've lost a hundred of his direct family lost his children his wife his parents his siblings his cousin cousins his second cousins in the whole tribe when you ask him how are you and he would say with a smile that is worth a million dollars alhamdulillah he Praises Allah over what you don't have a thing you don't have even a roof over your head or a dime in your pocket you can't even find a bite to eat yet he's content W by Allah he is rich and wealthy and self-sufficient while that billionaire is begging for Authority he's begging for recognition he's begging for attention and at the end of the day couple of years later both will face the inevitable both will die like any human being but then the real life begins the Muslim the believer the one who self-sufficient and Rich will enjoy his stay in the grave and when resurrected on the day of judgment will enjoy going to Paradise for eternity and that poor billionaire if he dies in the state of disbelief and kufur he will be tormented like hell his soul will exit his body in pieces and it would be so painful it's beyond imagination and let us not speak about what he's going to face in his grave and let alone what he's going to face in Hellfire for eternity the richness of the heart actually stems for from being content with the Divine decree whenever we surrender ourselves knowing that whatever Allah has decreed is best and Lasting rather than what goes and comes without any Baraka without any blessing in it when we're content with this fact then here is the richness of the heart which would overflow and make the soul rich as well so once you acknowledge that Allah is the giver and the withholder no one else can do that once you acknowledge this then you're content with his decree and you're thankful and grateful for his blessings and favors and to him you run whenever you have a Calamity or a problem that you want it to be unveiled and revealed or relieved and through this contentment through this satisfaction is when the heart is in poverty to Allah's gifts and favors and blessing this poverty in the heart to Allah is a person's richness and satisfaction the heart once it's blessed and favored by Allah to be content and satisfied with with Allah's gifts and favors and blessings being the king it would give generously to its subjects we've stated that the heart is the king and the body and the organs are his subjects and his soldiers so when the heart is Rich it will start to Grant gifts to his subjects the closest is the conference the soul so so it will give generously to the soul because Allah has given the heart richness and when the soul is granted these gifts you will find Tranquility calmness satisfaction content and you would find that the soul gives and offers its obligations willingly not through force and it takes the initiative of doing such obligations because it is associated with a rich heart so now they're synchronized now they want the same thing and now the soul becomes an ally and friend instead of being an adversary don't ask what beautiful life results from such an alliance between the heart and the Soul when your heart is filled with Iman and content and richness and the Soul goes side by side in compliance to whatever the heart says then you will find that the sweetness of life and the prosperity in such a life when the heart grants the limbs from its richness you will find that the limbs are submissive are respectful acting in a dignified way when the heart throws its grants to the face you will find light Illuminating from that face you will find Grace you will find a form of fear and respect to Those whom they have such a face and this is why people say Sheik this bloke this person there's light coming out of his face meaning that Iman has reflected on his face and it's glowing with Grace because Allah has filled his heart with Iman when the heart throws these favors and blessings and grants the tongue some of it then you will find the tongue speaking only the truth saying only what is righteous and wise and this is why some people when they talk you hear wisdom and some people who are poor in their hearts like the disbelievers even if they are leaders of countries when they speak they speak lies deceit and full of nonsense when the heart throws some of the grants on the eyes then the eyes become wise it Ponders around what it sees it contemplates and it lower its gaze from seeing what is Haram and likewise when the ear is granted such a grant then it will hear the advice and adhere to it and it will listen only to what's beneficial and gets you closer to Allah the poverty is the poverty of the heart in the authentic Hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to seek refuge in Allah from poverty many scholars said that the poverty that the prophet used to seek Refuge from is the poverty of the heart may Allah have mercy on his soul says the evidence is when the prophet sought refuge in Allah from poverty he himself the prophet got rid of the duny willingly and he gave everything he owes or he owned to the poor yet he still sought refuge in Allah from poverty so you're giving your wealth willingly to the poor you have nothing why are you seeking refuge in Allah from poverty because it's the poverty of the heart not not the poverty of the wealth so the most perfect of all people are those who depend entirely on Allah those who do not need others do not look at what others possess rather they're self-sufficient and they're happy and content with what has given them in the Dua the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam used to say and used to order us to say oh ever living oh self- sustaining and all sustaining by your mercy I seek help rectify all my Affairs and do not leave me in charge of my own Affairs even for the blink of an eye so we cannot do anything without Allah's guidance and help once you express your poverty to Allah once you show your in independence from what others have in their hearts and you do not fight and strive to get more and more regardless of the means you're getting it then Allah would make you the richest of all and Allah will take care of your all Affairs Allah says in the Quran whoever does righteousness whether male or female while he is a Believer we will surely cause him to live a good life this is in this world so even if you don't have money even if you're not healthy in your body but you have this good life which Scholars say it is content and this is the solution for all world problems to do righteousness to be a believing individual whether male or female then Allah would Grant you a good life and this can only be attained when you have self-sufficiency and you have richness in your heart we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
