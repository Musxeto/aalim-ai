  "title": "I have Urine incontinence, if the next athaan is called in my 3rd rakat, is my prayer invalid?",
  "transcript": "Saad from India. So my question is that if I am praying and I have urine incontinence, if the time is ended or the aghan is called in the second or third rakah, will the prayer be invalid as the wudu breaks after next prayer time begins in incontinence? No, no, no, no, the prayer is valid as long as you have managed to pray one full rakah. Even if the aghan is called, your prayer is valid. And when they say that if the second aghan is called, your wudu is invalid, it does not relate to the previous salat. It refers to the wudu itself. Meaning, if I am in the state of wudu, I prayed maghrib at the beginning of a time, and I'm still waiting for isha, after an hour, the isha aghan is called, here I have to renew my wudu. I cannot perform isha with the same wudu of maghrib. Not that it broke automatically, no, because I want to pray isha, I have to make a new wudu. But if I delayed the maghrib until five minutes before the aghan of isha, and I started the takbeer, I made wudu and I started takbeer, I prayed one full rakah, and while I was standing for the second rakah in the fatiha, the aghan is called, my wudu is intact. I finish my second and my third, offer my salutation and offer salam, then I go to the toilet and make wudu for the isha aghan, and Allah knows best. you"
