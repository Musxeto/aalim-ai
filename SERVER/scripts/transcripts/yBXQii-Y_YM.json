  "transcript": "matt from the uk uh so my question is if someone has west west i think you repaired on twitter that they should repeat the area or something similar uh is this mandatory like in the last day of hours for example if he's already in the middle of the area does he repeat the whole area or rectify what he got wrong like the word or yeah the same applies like to sharehold the road as we repeat like the whole thing or like only the word where he got wrong he says if i made a mistake in fatiha and the mistake is in a single word should i repeat the full verse or into should i repeat the full phrase or only the word so if i said i said instead of okay it's accepted in some dissertations and it can work but if i made such a mistake so should i repeat it's best to repeat the whole phrase so that the meaning would fall into place but if you just repeated the single word and correct it corrected it and rectified it this does the job in sha allah and allah azza knows best"
