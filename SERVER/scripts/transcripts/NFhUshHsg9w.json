  "title": "Getting special favors due to his position & Bribes in Islam assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Yumna from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I have a question. My husband is an army officer. He was appointed to a civil club, having restaurant, gym, talent court, etc. Where his interaction was with wealthy and rich people. He was appointed to what? It was a club. It was a combination of restaurant, gym, swimming pool, and he was their secretary. So his job is what? To protect it or to guard it? To deal with it. To deal with it in all terms. To deal in everything. Oh, to manage it. To manage it. Yes, to manage it. Okay. Okay. And people, they asked him for favours and he favoured them. And in return, they presented my husband with expensive gifts like dry fruits, clothes, and a few asked him to invest in shares and land and all this. Okay, the question. Allah knows best. He demanded them or they gave him by themselves. And I am in doubt if all this is haram or... All of this. All of this is haram. Every single penny that he's getting from them or favour that he's getting from them is known in Islam as bribe, rashwa. And the Prophet said, may Allah curse the one who gives it, and may Allah curse the one who receives it. So, your husband is cursed. Those who give him asking for such favours are cursed as well. If your husband was not managing the club, they would not even give him an old pair of shoes as a gift. He is giving him what they're giving him because of his position. Yet he's getting a salary from the army and from the government. Anything he takes from them is haram for him. But it is halal for you and for his children. He's the one who's going to be burnt in hell because of it. You guys can enjoy it without any problem. And Allah knows best."
