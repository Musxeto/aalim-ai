  "transcript": "When we read the last and final revelation of the glorious Quran, when I say this life is a test for the hereafter, what are the guidelines of this test? If you read surah al assur chapter number 103, it is called as rah nijad the path to salvation, the path to ja. It says in surah al assur chapter number 103 verse number 1 to3 by the token of time Allah is taking the oath of time verily man is in a state of loss except those who have faith those who have righteous deed those who invite people to truth do dawa those who invite people to patience and perseverance. So according to surah al assur man is in kasara every human being will go to hell except those who have these four criteria. Number one im number righteous deed number one faith number two righteous deed number three inviting people to truth doing dawa inviting people to patience and perseverance. If any one of these four criteria is missing, you shall not enter Jenna. You may be a very good Muslim. You may be praying five times a day. You may be fasting in the month of Ramadan. You may have gone for Hajj. You may have the mark on your forehead. But if you don't do dawa according to surah assur, you shall not enter Jenna. If Allah wants to forgive you and put you in Jenna, that's Allah's prerogative. But under normal circumstances, all four are equally important. Not only dawa, I im righteous deed, inviting people to truth and inviting people to patience and pursue. All four are equally important. According to Imam Shafi, may Allah have mercy on him. He said that if Surah Alsar alone was revealed for humanity, it would have been sufficient for guidance. Imagine the great Imam. If surah al Assur was revealed alone not the full Quran only surah alas three verses it is the second shortest surah in the Quran. If this was revealed alone it would have been sufficient for haya for guidance for humanity. There was a person a Jewish beggar at the time of Hafnadaras Kalani and we know from the books of history that half Kalani he was a judge and he was quite affluent and rich. So this poor Jewish man goes and asks him that I heard that a prophet said that this dunya this world for the believers is a prison and for the unbelievers it is paradise. How can you justify I am a beggar my clothes are torn. You are such a rich man. You are a Muslim. I am a non-Muslim. How can this world be a paradise for me and a prison for you? Had Kalani he replied and this hadith that the Jewish beggar quoted is from Sai Muslim volume number seven had number 7417 and half Kalani may Allah have mercy on him he said that the Muslim knows that in the next life he's going to get Jenna and if he knows what Jenna is in this world even if you're the richest man. This life is like prison compared to the next life. Even if you're the richest man, even if you're the king, if you know what is awaiting you for Jenna, this world is nothing. Not even 0.00001% compared to Akara. That's the reason those who truly know Islam, what they want, they want to go to Jenna fast. They're not afraid of death. The end of death why if a human being is on the straight path of sarat of sural ass if he dies he goes to Jenna so who would not like to hasten to die you cannot kill ourselves it's haram suicide is haram but of course in the way of Allah if you're on the hak you're not afraid you aren't afraid of anyone if you're on the hak a true Muslim if he's on the he's not afraid of death because if he dies he goes to paradise even if he's the richest man in the world even if he's 10 times richer than Bill Gates Alon Musk and Jeff Bess all Nothing."
