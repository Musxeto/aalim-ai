  "title": "Woke up late for fajr (4 min before sunrise) â€” rush Fajr or pray properly, and repeat?",
  "transcript": "Faiz from the U.S. Sheikh my question is about something that I've experienced recently. So I woke up kind of late for Fajr. I did my Wudu and I saw the time was 6 a.m. So I immediately checked if I was having time remaining. So the Ishraq time was 6.04. So the first part of the question is like should I rush my prayer to make it before that time and or like should I wait like after that time's up and have it like as a missed prayer. And secondly if I do try to rush the prayer so and if I see like the time 6.04 like that's like the exact time of Ishraq. Is that prayer valid or like do I have to like repeat it? First of all you have the right to ask for one question Ya Faiz and you have the right to remain silent but nevertheless. First of all when people wake up late are they accountable if they woke up late unintentionally? They didn't set the alarm. It happened that they woke up late. They woke up late miserable and sad and it's against their will. So there's no sin on them Alhamdulillah. So the moment you wake up late you go and do your thing and pray normally without rushing things to the best of your ability because there is no fault at you. No way ever someone would tell you oh it's three minutes for sunrise. Wait. Fault prayer is to be prayed immediately regardless whether the sun is rising or setting or whatever. You have to pray it. You don't wait and delay it further. And those who prayed it before after the time was due you done it. You said oh should I pray it again? What's the use? If you pray it again there's no use because as if you're saying that my previous prayer was invalid. Why was it invalid? Because I was late in praying. So what would make the other one valid? It's even later than prescribed. So there's no point in repeating the prayer none whatsoever."
