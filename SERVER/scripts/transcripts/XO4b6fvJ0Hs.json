  "transcript": "honey from the us um so my question was regarding uh so for the past couple of months i've had like severe stomach pain and like uh severe wastewater like during my prayer and like ninety percent of my day could like it's like i can't i can't really function properly and for the like for the past few days i've been having bad dreams of like something done near my house like near like a yard and i feel like this is like a sit here kind of thing so i want to know how i should go about this like what should i do okay i will answer inshallah honey from the us he says that i have stomach aches whispers and now lately i've been getting uh nightmares so i think that i have black magic well honey not everything we suffer from can be attributed to black magic and i've said this so many times whenever we have problems in our lives it's very easy to blame others so if my child flunks school i say this is evil eye if my wife's my wife nags me all day and all night i say she's possessed by jinn if i come out of the office tired wanting to go home and i find a flat tire i would say that this is envy and if i don't get a raise or a bonus i say this is black magic someone is haunting me not to get all of these things or casting his spell and this is not true yes we believe in the existence of black magic gen possession envy and evil lie no doubt about it but who in their right mind hani would come and go to a sorcerer pay them haram money and maybe slaughter or sacrifice for the jinn committing shirk just to cast black magic or a spell up against you if it was available or this easy you can just go to any uh 7-eleven outlet and get some people would have done it to liberate palestine it's not that easy and it's not that convenient you have to be really really evil to get out of the fold of islam and do some something like that so what is it i don't know my advice go to a medical doctor get a medical checkup and see maybe there's something wrong maybe there's an illness maybe there is a deficiency in some of your minerals or vitamins or whatever if all things checks out clearly and and good then you have to refer to rookia and rookie is done easily on my website the procedure is there make a lot of drawings to jude for allah to cure you and to uplift any such illnesses and you'll be fine in few days inshallah"
