  "transcript": "Heena from India Sir, I want to know that who is responsible to give alliances to a divorced woman? Who is supposed to give what? Alliances. Where is she living? Expenses. Where is she living? Is she living with her father, with her brother, with her sons? In her husband's house, but separately. Now he divorced her. So what is the relationship between him and her? Nothing. But her father said that die and never come back home. And her brother said that I can keep you, but my wife will have problems with you. So she's living in her, means my mother, she's living in a house, but we live downstairs and our father lives upstairs. And does she have an income? No, she doesn't work, but Alhamdulillah Allah gave her. Alhamdulillah. As long as she is not communicating with her ex-husband, and he has provided her with a separate accommodation, may Allah reward him for this kindness, then he's not obliged to give her a single red penny. This is a responsibility of her own children. So if he has children and they can provide for her food and pay the utility bills, then they must. If she has savings, then she must provide for herself even if her children can. They're not obliged as long as she's rich and capable. But if she doesn't have an income, she doesn't have any wealth, then it's the responsibility of her children. And this is mandated by Shari'ah because they will inherit her if she were to die, and Allah knows best."
