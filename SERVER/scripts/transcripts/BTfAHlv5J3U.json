  "transcript": "sam he says being a foreign language teacher for teenager groups i use pictures to explain vocabularies is this legitimate in islam is it okay if i use photos of cartoon characters uh depicting humans and animals or shall i use real living creatures pictures instead like men women children and animals first of all the prohibition is in the actual drawing so the one who draws is sinful and it is one of the major sins in islam as directed and instructed by the prophet alaihis salat wasallam and they will be severely punished on the day of judgment for what they had created imitating the creation of allah so the people who draw or make sculptures are the one with this warning now those who use these pictures if it's a for a legitimate reason and it's not hanging them or using them in clothes etc if there is a legitimate reason and the pictures themselves are halal you can use those so for you as a teacher you can use drawings of an elephant of a fish of a bird of a human being without any problem though photographs are far safer because the photograph is the actual creation of allah azzawajal yet these drawings are an imitation so it is best to be safe rather than sorry however this might not be possible all the time so therefore using halal drawings in order to illustrate a word or a an idea or an account a concept you have in your mind this is permissible providing there is nothing haram such as depicting pictures of women or illicit relationships or something that is prohibited in islam nevertheless using photographs of course other than photographs of women is a better option and a safer option for you"
