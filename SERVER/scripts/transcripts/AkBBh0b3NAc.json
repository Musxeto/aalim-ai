  "transcript": "um ishirak says some people say that it's okay to skip two pillars and be late as the shafiri school says i don't know what the school says in this regard but what they're saying is totally bogus not true if i am reciting the fatih and imam goes for and i insist on continuing reciting the fatih and he says that this is the second pillar and i finish my fatih and as i'm going for he goes for sujud this is not congregational prayer i'm not praying with the imam i'm praying with a different imam that is virtual or is not a present so this is not true"
