  "transcript": "hamza from the u.s hamza my friend you sent me this question on the email yesterday and i've answered you but probably you did not get the answer so i wish that you had asked something else hamza says that he works in a car wash and after doing the car wash he noticed that there are small scratches on the body paint that cannot be seen except with light so normal daytime you cannot see it but if you bring a specific light or strong light on it you can see it and he says that the car wash has a disclaimer saying that any paint damages that may occur due to the car wash it's not our responsibility so he says is there any sin on me the answer is no for two reasons one the first reason is that it was not you who did these scratches you just found them which means that most likely most probably the car came in with the scratches on them secondly even if you caused it unintentionally or due to the fact that you're doing a good job and washing the car thoroughly the disclaimer takes the burden off your back and you don't have to worry about that insha allah"
