  "title": "Is my prayer valid in normal clothes, all of my awrah is covered? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Rukaiah from Bangladesh. Sheikh, I \nwear women's clothing that's below my Sorry, yeah, below my,   above my knee level and it's white and \nI'm wearing a long skirt underneath it. So I want to ask If my prayer is \nvalid when I wear this clothing Also I don't wear anything underneath \nthe skirt but my Awrah is covered. And my mother told that I have \nto wear something inside it. So can I just wear the skirt \nalone and wear nothing under that? When you're wearing the skirt are \nyou wearing an abaya on top of that? No Sheikh. No this is not recommended. The scholars say that in order for \nyou to pray you have to have a jilbab. which is an outer garment.   So if women in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, \nthe subcontinent wear a shirwal khamis, they would say that our awrah is \ncovered, you cannot see any flesh,   but still you need an outer garment So that it would not expose your bone \nstructure, your body curves, etc. and would hide these clothes. So to address your question, your \ndress which is above the knee and underneath it is a skirt. This is covering your Awra, you can sit \nin front of Maharams and other women without any problem being above \nthe knee or under the knee. That doesn't make any difference \nbecause you're already wearing a skirt. And this skirt covers your thighs, your \nbuttocks, your legs, so you have no problem. When it comes to prayer, it is \nhighly recommended and some say   it is mandatory that you wear an \nouter garment over all of that. of that and Allah azzawajal knows best."
