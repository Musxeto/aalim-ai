  "title": "If I  donâ€™t read the Terms and Conditions, am I SINFUL?",
  "transcript": "Alim from Ireland Nobody in his right mind would read such agreements that are formulated by the company for legal reasons and they put all the fine prints and the jargons and their legal terminologies over 10 or 15 or 20 pages. So when you buy products of Microsoft or Google or Apple or Amazon or the likes, they always have this long number of pages of their policies and their agreement and you have to check in, nobody reads it. And nobody is bounded to sign it, you just check it and move on, put a check and move on. Am I sinful? No I'm not sinful, I'm not obliged to read such a thing because I can put my own obligations as well and they have to agree to that and they won't agree to that. So ignore it and move on Achi."
