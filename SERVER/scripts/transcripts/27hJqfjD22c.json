  "transcript": "We have Amatullah from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh before I begin I just want to inform you that I never ever received any answer for every single question I posted on your website very very long ago and those were urgent. And Sheikh also along with other remaining members I was assured my turn on Sunday from the left to list on the other Saturday but was never given a chance. That questions remaining two can I ask that now apart from the present one you did make that exception for our brother earlier. I don't remember what exceptions I made so do forgive me we have a long list of callers waiting. You have one question to ask. Thank you. Sheikh I want to understand one thing properly. So I read this from 5th person Islam Q and it's even there on the other sites regarding ruling for a family pertaining to Haram income of father husband and my question is not whether it is sure false. It's something else to kindly listen. So it says, but you should not take more than you need because of doubts as to whether it's permissible to benefit from one who's earning the Haram and his heirs must get rid of the rubbish money by returning to owners or otherwise spending in charity. Even said somewhere that don't even use it like to get food for yourself and others. And when you go to a man which is doubtful it is most have not to take it. If the Haram will dominant it's not lawful for the children to use it. It and other sites stated. My question is. Now if we're daily necessities there's so much caution and what is only allowed to use not more than what they necessarily need then is it not considered taking more than what's permissible if the wife in such a case except such money from her husband to pay the Zakat goal when she had the alternative option of paying it from the gold itself but due to any reason she's not able to. Jazakallah khair. So the long story and the question is the husband's earning Haram. What's the ruling for the wife and the children to benefit from his earnings? He's bringing food, he's bringing money, he's giving it to his family. It's an issue of dispute among scholars. Some say this is Haram money. They cannot use it or utilize it. Some say no it's fine totally fine they can use it as long as it's not stolen. If the earning is Haram due to the means of earning it but not the actual money as in stolen goods then he's sinful for his earning but the money itself the dollars the banknotes are Halal once they're transferred to buying goods or giving it to his kids and wife. Third opinion is that you can consume whatever is needed and whatever is surplus from your need you must refrain from that. Now this is something between you and Allah. What you would like to choose it's up to you. Don't force me to follow what you think is best or is more cautious or this or that. This is your opinion stick with it. You fear Allah azza wa jal don't take anything. Up to you. My own preference and opinion is that I support the second opinion which states that if the earning is through Haram means he works in a bank, deals with interest, he sells Haram stuff like media stuff or cigarettes or the likes. The earning the means that he's earning from is Haram. His income is Haram for him but once he exchanges hands with this income he gives it to his wife he buys food he buys a house it becomes Halal for them all to keep as heirs or as in his life. This is what I'm convinced of and this is the most authentic opinion. Now you don't like this opinion and you think that it's best it's safer to not take anything go to you go ahead with it but don't condemn others who don't share your opinion. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you. If you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah. Thank you."
