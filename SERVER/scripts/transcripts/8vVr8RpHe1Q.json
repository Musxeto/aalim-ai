  "transcript": "our hat says when I'm in prayer I sometimes get doubts about how many such days I did the people who have OCD and always get these doubts every single salat derive offer to such days or once as de is this my third rock our fourth raka they must not offer through the cell because it is compulsive disorder they have to ignore it and base their prayer on the most likely thing they believe whether offer another sister or continue as you are but do not offer to do the sajo because it will only escalate and increase and intensity until it drives you out of your mind"
