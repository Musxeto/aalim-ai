  "transcript": "Ateeb from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh my question is Psychologically speaking we love certain things in this dunya such as a car because we know the sifat of those things when when it comes to Longing for Jannah, admiring Jannah, we are given in Islam. We are shown the sifat of Jannah We will have the hurul ayn, the rivers etc But now when I sit down and think that okay, I have to I have to stop sinning because of imagining Jannah I recollect that there is an attribution to Ibn Abbas in which he said that you cannot imagine Jannah So I'm confused how to imagine Jannah. Can I imagine Jannah by using the world what I know of this world? Whatever you do Your imagination would fall short Because in the hadith Allah says I've prepared for my servants in Jannah what no eye had seen what no ear had heard of and what No heart had ever imagined So no matter what you imagine in Jannah, it is a fraction of the true reality of it Having said that of course one aspires to go to Jannah to Be among those who dwell in the favors and blessings of Allah Azza wa Jal while Acknowledging and realizing that no matter how you imagine you're falling short so no matter how much you think the beauty of Your spouse in Jannah, this is not even point zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent of the true reality Of what awaits you? So there's no problem in imagining it, but don't go overboard with these philosophical ideas which Shaitaan is inserting in your head because his Objective is to get you out of the fold of Islam either by rejecting the whole concept of such Unimaginable beauty or by doubting here or there be careful have the conviction and the Iman of The shepherds in the deserts of the farmers in their farms of the layman Who may have never read the Quran in their lives, but they have Concrete and solid Conviction and Iman that they would fight the whole world If they try to prove something against it they don't have the knowledge you have but they have the fear of Allah the hope in what Allah has and the unquestionable Conviction of what Allah has told us and Allah knows best You"
