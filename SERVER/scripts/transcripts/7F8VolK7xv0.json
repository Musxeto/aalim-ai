  "title": "Can we pray Sunnah prayers sitting down even if we are capable of standing",
  "transcript": "says is it true that we can pray sunnah prayers sitting even if we are capable of standing the prophet said the prayer of a person of an individual sitting down is half the reward of the prayer of a person standing up what does it mean it means that any voluntary prayer that you offer you can do that sitting down but you will lose half of the reward unless you're exempted so someone who's sick and cannot stand up he prays sitting down and he gets the full reward you"
