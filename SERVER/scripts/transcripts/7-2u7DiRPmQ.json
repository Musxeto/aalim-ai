  "title": "Are you Arrogant or a Narcissist? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "Asma Sheikh what does islam say about \nnarcissists from your point of view?   A narcissist if i understand correctly \nis a person who is fond of himself   and this is stage one not in \ncancer in what is worse than cancer   before arrogance which is stage four so \narrogance defined by the prophet ﷺ is to be looking down at people, resenting them and \nrejecting the truth when it comes to you   this is the definition of arrogance [Al Kibr] when the prophet ﷺ was asked about a \nperson liking to have a beautiful suit   or a beautiful set of clothes \nand a beautiful pair of shoes   would that be arrogance? he said no \nAllah is beautiful and Allah loves beauty   so there's a thin line between being \nnarcissist and being beautiful.   Being beautiful being handsome good looking \nhaving a good body working out and loving   it because it is something nice and beautiful is \ngood. Being narcissist usually is accompanied by   an internal feeling of thinking that I'm \nabove everyone else I'm smarter than everyone   else I'm more eloquent I am more intelligent, \nI know everything when everyone else doesn't   and everyone knows that this comes with the \nterritory. When the knowledge is superficial   when the knowledge is not genuine it seems \nto me that I am the most knowledgeable person   and when you talk to me I say what do you \nknow what did you study I've done so much   studies and research I know \ni've been there I've done that   now narcissism is when this is an internal \nfeeling that someone like me with 33 years   of experience under my belt and giving dawah \nand so many conferences and lectures and   questions answered blah blah blah inside \nI feel that I must have a position   very high an elite with Allah. I am \nthe answer to the world's problems,   I know more than anybody else. \nThis is the silent killer, yet it is not showing clearly to the people \nwhich makes it dangerous but curable   once it comes out of my mouth and \nI start looking down at people   and I start saying I did my research I know i have \nstudied I have done I have this i it's all \"I\"   THEN this becomes arrogance when you \nlook down at people when you start   thinking highly of yourself this is why a true \nbeliever is always humble even if he was the king   where he has the power the authority the \nwealth everything is under his fingertips   yet when he is addressed he sees \nhimself as small as a small insect   fearing what Allah will do to him knowing his \nown shortcomings. when people come to him,   \"oh you are the scholar of the world, \nyou are the most knowledgeable person\" Sheikh Abdul al-Aziz Ibn Baz   and I'm talking about real scholars may \nAllah have mercy on his soul, in an interview the presenter was saying that, no one has \never seen such a man with such knowledge   and he is the remedy for all illnesses and \nhe is the light in all these darknesses,   Allah has blessed us with him Allah has this he \ninterrupted him, and he said i pray to Allah that   Allah forgives you for the evil that you had said \nhe is not appropriate at all to say these things   about people you don't know who i truly \nam, and in humbleness and in humility,   he started his lecture refusing people to say \nthis. Ibn Uthaymeen once in a public lecture it's   found one said while introducing him and today \nwe are having a guest who is beyond introduction   no need to introduce him so the sheikh said wait \nwait wait nobody is not in need to be introduced   Allah is the only one who is well known, \nothers are in need to be introduced to know   about them and such praise is not permissible \nhow do you praise a human being by saying without   any need of introduction' who has no need to \nuh be introduced, so this is true knowledge   so narcissism as i said is stage one and the \ndestruction comes when it reaches stage four which   is arrogance may Allah azza protect us because \neven if the whole world come and praises me   and says Sheikh Assim is this and Sheikh Assim is \nthat yeah i would be happy but deep down inside   no! this is one of Shaytan's traps! \nall what they're saying is not true   because i know myself i know my flaws i know \nmy shortcomings and i know definitely that   if sins were to have an odor nobody would be \nable to sit next to me. So a true believer   knows himself whether people criticize him \nor praise him and this is a sign of sincerity   when someone comes and says wow what a beautiful \nlecture sheikh that was what I needed to live to   listen to what I needed to hear, it doesn't matter \nto me alhamdulillah i praise Allah it's Allah's   guidance that I was able to give it and if \nsomebody comes and criticizes it what is this   i could have said it better this is a waste \nof time you've wasted 40 minutes of our time   on a lecture that has no value it didn't get us \ncloser to Allah I wouldn't feel sad or depressed   I would shrug my shoulders and say i did my best \nAllah is the only one who I'm away waiting for   praise and reward from not from you and not \nfrom him so this would help you a lot in   curing such an illness may Allah protect us all!"
