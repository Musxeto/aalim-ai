  "title": "If Imam is giving Khutbah in another language, can I make Dhikr",
  "transcript": "Abu Abdur Rahman from Italy. The question is if I go to Friday prayer and the Imam during Khutba, the language he is speaking, I don't understand it. Can I continue doing my Zikr? The answer is yes. The essence of sitting for Friday oration or Khutba is to understand, comprehend and implement. If you fail to do this due to the fact that you are unable to understand a word of what the Imam is saying due to the language barrier, there is no problem in you reciting in your head the Qur'an or making Zikr or offering salutation upon the Prophet ï·º without, you have to be careful, without annoying those sitting around you or distracting them and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
