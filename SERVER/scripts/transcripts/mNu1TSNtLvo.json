  "transcript": "There is a good example for you in the messenger of Allah for those who hope for Allah and the Last Day and remember Allah much In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds Peace and blessings be upon the - The master of the first and the last Our prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions As for the rest, dear brothers and sisters in Islam, peace and blessings be upon you Welcome to this new episode of the role model coming to you everyday in Ramadan of 1444 of Hijrah The prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was the perfect human being without any doubt And part of being a human being is that you are pleased but sometimes you are angered So, it is not true that in order to be a perfect human being that you should not be angry A person without anger can't be a human being He is a wimp Someone attacks your wife or your sister and you don't become angry and said, it's all fine, it's all fine I'll be patient No, you're not a real man There are times that you must become angry Yet we all know it's part of Islam that one must suppress his anger The prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was approached once by a man And his companion asked him, give me advice The prophet said, Alayhis Salaam, do not become angry He said, okay, give me more The prophet said, do not become angry The man said, okay, give me more The prophet kept on repeating, do not become angry, do not become angry, do not become angry This shows you that anger is something that Islam orders you to suppress However, anger can be suppressed and you're recommended to suppress it But in some cases, you have to show your anger You have to express it When is it preferred and when it is abhorred? It is abhorred when it's for worldly matters Someone parks in front of your home and you become angry and furious I know of this person who, when someone parked in front of his house He came with a baseball bat, smashing all the windows of the car The guy just parked there for ten minutes to pray in the Masjid and come back Not violating your rights And this is not your right, this is not your God-given right This is not your parking This is a public area, it's a road But some people are mentally challenged So such rage, when it's for your own safety, for your own self Someone insulted you, someone criticized you and you become angry and you make an issue out of it This is abhorred in Islam But when this anger is in the sake or in the sight of Allah Azza wa Jal, for the sake of Allah When you see sins being committed When you see things that go against Allah's commands and the Prophet's Sunnah, and you become angry because of that This is something that is recommended and you're rewarded for it Now, our role model, alayhi salatu wa salam, was the perfect human being What were the incidents that were reported to us that he was angry? Because there are so many incidents, one of us would have exploded in rage Yet the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, kept his calm and cool And he did not react negatively And this is what is meant by do not become angry Meaning, do not do things that you would regret due to your anger These things are impulsive, you just divorce your wife, why? Walla Sheikh I was angry, she said you're not a man, I'm not a man? You're divorced And then 5 seconds later, what have I done? And he keeps on knocking on scholars' doors Sheikh, did the divorce take place or not? Can you find us a loophole here or there? And this is what the Prophet prohibited, alayhi salatu wa salam The consequences of such anger Not that you do not become angry because you're a human being, you have to So what are the incidents that the Prophet became angry in, alayhi salatu wa salam? There are a number of which we must study to learn and acquire knowledge And whenever we are placed in the same situation, we can analyze Should we become angry like the Prophet was, alayhi salatu wa salam? Or should we look the other side and pretend that we did not see anything? So we will mention some and not all because we don't have enough time For example, the Prophet, alayhi salatu wa salam, got angry when his companions disputed and argued over things that are beyond dispute and argument Such as the Qur'an We know that the Qur'an was revealed in seven ahruf Whether you translate it as dialects, as styles, as whatever These are the seven ahruf that everybody agrees upon And the authentic hadiths in the Sahih confirm it So we embrace that the Qur'an was revealed in seven ahruf And we embrace the fact that there are ten recitations, qiraat Which are well-known to the scholars Now, to go into the details, we don't need this We're believers We believe that we're created from clay, from mud, from earth, from soil To go into details and start to analyze and to go back to the labs This is not necessary or not needed Because we believe So the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, once heard the voices of two men Disputing over one ayah The companion said that the Prophet came out of his house With anger visible on his face And he said to them in a scolding fashion Those before you were destroyed because they differed in their scriptures Reported by Imam Muslim in the Sahih So, we as Muslims believe that the Qur'an confirms itself And if there is something that we cannot understand We attribute this to our own understanding And that we don't have the ability to understand it And we go back to the scholars And we say that Allah and the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, know best Not that we start to doubt the Qur'an or the Ahruf or the preservation of the Ahruf And if you look nowadays and at contemporary times Especially on social media You find what is called in the Hadith, Ar-Ruwaybidah The silly man, someone without any importance in Islam You'll find giants who were made to look like midgets And midgets who were inflated to look like giants And they speak, left, right and centre about Islam Halal, haram and about things that are pillars of Islam like the Qur'an And they cast doubts in people's minds Not because they're hypocrites, inshallah they're not But because they want to flex their muscles I know you don't know I have higher degrees, I am an academic, I am this, I am that And they start spreading doubts among the people about the layman And then they apologise Akhi, keep a lid on it You don't have to do this You don't have to search in the books of historians and of the scholars To get something that people don't know of or have never heard of And exaggerate it and inflate it And show it to the public as if you've found Antarctica Or Atlantis or whatever was lost Antarctica I think they now have it This is a big problem Just to show off and look at me I know what others don't know And you confuse them laymen, and you confuse the Muslims And you cast doubts and you allow the disbelievers to speak ill about the Qur'an Do you think if this happened at the time of the Prophet alayhis salaatu wasalam He would be pleased with it? Or he would be angered by it? Wallahi he would be angered by it Also, the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam Used to sometimes make dua When angry And this is very very very rare And if I say that it's only 3 or 4 incidents in his whole lifetime I wouldn't be exaggerating But when you come to it as an individual incident, a separate incident You may read it and say, subhanallah, how is it possible? For example, two men once came to the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam And they said something to him which made him angry Mother Aisha said I did not hear it And the Prophet was outraged by what they said So he cursed them And he said bad words to them And they left Mother Aisha came, frightened and terrified Oh Prophet of Allah If there is anyone who is a great loser It's these two men So the Prophet said why is that? She said you cursed them And said bad things to them Definitely they will be cursed by Allah azza wa jal The Prophet smiled alayhis salatu wasalam and said Oh Aisha, didn't you know what I made a condition to my Lord? I said to Allah azza wa jal, oh Allah I am a human being Meaning that I'm not perfect So whomever among the Muslims That I may curse or say bad things to Oh Allah make my curse to be a form of purification And a great reward to them Which means that this curse is not a curse Actually it's dua of mercy and great reward for them And this is exactly what happened also with Umm Sulaym The mother of Anas, you know the servant of the Prophet Asam Anas His mother's name is Umm Sulaym Umm Sulaym had a young orphan girl raised in her house And this orphan once came to the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam And the Prophet saw her And he was amazed by how fast she grew So he said to her, oh you, oh you You have grown May Allah stop you from growing So the girl went terrified to the Prophet salallahu wasalam crying Saying the Prophet made dua that I may not grow I will not grow The young girl was frightened and she had all the right to be frightened So Umm Sulaym rushed to the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam And said to her, oh Prophet of Allah You made dua against my orphan girl And he said, what is that Umm Sulaym? So Umm Sulaym said, she claims that you said that may you never grow up And that you stay as you are So the Prophet laughed alayhis salatu wasalam He said, Umm Sulaym, don't you know I had a condition with my Lord That I am a human being I am happy and pleased like anyone else is happy and pleased And I also get angry like anyone else get angry as a human being So oh Allah, whomever I make dua against from my Ummah That he is not worthy of it Oh Allah, make it a purification And a cleansing And a good deed that he would get closer by it from you on the day of judgement So this clearly indicates that the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam Acknowledged his human nature But due to that he was the mercy sent to mankind He asked Allah azza wa jal to add more to that mercy By even when he curses those who are not worthy of being cursed Or say bad things to them That Allah switches it and flips it to be something positive For their sake and for their own goodness And this is as I said only two or three or maybe four incidents That are known throughout all of his life that he had cursed Those who are not worthy of being cursed Of course transforming it into mercy and cleansing and purification Does not fall for those who deserve it Like those who deal in riba, like those who fornicate Like those who deal in bribery and steal people's money No, when the Prophet aleyhis salatu wasalam curses them They're cursed for what they had done What other incidents the Prophet got angry in alayhis salatu wasalam Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari may Allah be pleased with him said A man came to the Prophet aleyhis salatu wasalam and explained himself He said, Oh Prophet of Allah when the fajr prayer is established I tend to delay it so the iqama is called I tend to come a little bit slow and waste some time Because the imam prolongs the salat too much The guy is like praying for 25 minutes, half an hour And that is a lot and we can't take this because it's too long The Prophet aleyhis salatu wasalam as Abu Mas'ud may Allah be pleased with him says I've never seen him angry more than that incident He was outraged and he said, Oh people among you there are those who are specialized in making people repel from Islam There are those among you when they speak they make you hate Islam And this is a serious offense, be careful You and I could be one of those when we give da'wah Are we mindful of the impact of what we're saying and doing? I'm talking about the majority not about a single specific ignorant imbecile Who know even if you read an ayah of the Quran he would be repelled by it No this guy is trash we don't care about him I'm talking about the impact of your da'wah of your actions of what you say On the majority of the people Are they benefiting? Go ahead keep it up Are they repelled? Because you're selecting things that people don't know And highlighting it and they say Islam can't be like this I'm reserved No you caused this So the Prophet was angry and he said among you there are those who make people repel from Islam When you lead others get short and concise Because behind you there might be praying the weak the elderly Those who have errands they want to go and fulfill Likewise the Prophet ﷺ whenever he was attacked for his own self He would probably forgive But when the attack was towards Sharia Towards religion Quran or Sunnah This is not a time to be diplomatic and play it cool No you have to show your resentment to what is being said As a form of defense of Islam This is not a place to be diplomatic They're attacking Islam, insulting the Prophet ﷺ, insulting the religion And you say it's an issue of dispute I know where you're coming from No you don't You have to show your anger if you're a true Muslim And the hell with everybody else who cares So once the Prophet was distributing the booties of war and giving to the Muslims But he is the messenger of Allah So he knows that certain people segments of people Deserve more like for example the dignitaries of Quraish Who just accepted Islam They were enemies of Islam But because they were dignitaries of Quraish The Prophet gave them a hundred camels each So that they would love Islam and get stronger in Islam And those behind them would follow them While the Ansaar, the close beloved companions of Medina The Prophet did not give them anything So some of the hypocrites thought that this was unfair Not knowing the wisdom behind it So they wanted to question the Prophet ﷺ One of them even went further by objecting And said this is a division Allah's face was not sought after Now who are you accusing? The divider Who's the divider? The Prophet of Allah Are you saying that the Prophet's division is not fair And he is not seeking Allah's face by it? This is blasphemous So the Prophet ﷺ got outraged when he was told of this statement But then he calmed down and he said May Allah have mercy on my brother Musa Peace be upon him He was abused, insulted and harmed With things that were far greater than this Yet he was tolerant and patient So it shows you that the anger of the Prophet ﷺ is not for himself Rather it's for the religion Also the Prophet ﷺ once came to the masjid And on the wall of the masjid he saw a sputum You know when someone collects from his chest and from his throat and spits it out It's visible and it's repulsive So the Prophet ﷺ saw this and he was angry And his face became red and this was a sign of his anger Whenever the Prophet ﷺ got angry his face would become red And he would never avenge for his own self Never It would only be for the religion of Allah And this is an insult to the religion of Allah When you spit it in the direction of the Qibla when you're praying in the wall of the masjid The masjid is supposed to be purified and cleaned So he was angered by it A woman from the Ansar saw his anger Went straight to it Rubbed it out, scratched it out until it was removed from the wall And then brought perfume and placed it on its spot So now the wall has been perfumed of the masjid And the Prophet ﷺ said, how good this is That's a very good thing she did Praising it and showing the Muslims When to be angry? When the masjid is being made filthy, dirty, disrespected And when to be happy and pleased? When it's perfumed, it's cleaned It's been taken care of A three quick incidents because our time is up And we don't want to hold the callers from their questions Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-As Came to the Prophet ﷺ with two garments Dyed in saffron And the Prophet had prohibited the Muslims from wearing clothes dyed in saffron Not yellow Yellow is a color but saffron is a herb And dying your clothes with it Which gives it a scent, it gives it a color Is imitating the disbelievers and the idol worshipers So the Prophet prohibited this Abdullah ibn Amr came to the Prophet wearing it The Prophet was outraged And you can see it in his face And he said to him, did your mother order you to do this? You're saying this to a grown up man So he knew that the Prophet was scolding him So he said, oh Prophet of Allah, should I wash them? And remove the saffron from them The Prophet said, no, burn them And this is his punishment for defying the Prophet's instructions ﷺ In another incident The Prophet saw one of his companions wearing a golden ring And everyone knows that it's prohibited for men To wear anything that has gold in it Whether it's a ring, cuff links, a watch, a pen, a chain holder or a key holder So the Prophet got angry and you can see it in his face Went straight to the man, snatched the ring from his finger and tossed it away And he said, why would anyone of you take a fire of stone and place it in his hand? And finally, the Prophet was outraged When Bilal came to him once and said, oh Prophet of Allah I had a heated argument with Abu Dharr Al-Ghaffari One of the great companions and the first to migrate And in the heated argument, he was so angry, he said to me You are a son of a black woman So he is insulting him that his mother is black This is racists In Islam, we don't tolerate any such racism So he went and complained to the Prophet ﷺ The Prophet was angry and he summoned Abu Dharr And when Abu Dharr came and he said to him You are a man of ignorance of pre-Islamic era For saying this to this companion of mine Do you say to him and insult him by the color of his mother? Abu Dharr came back to his senses Went to Bilal, placed his cheek on the sand And said to him, oh son of the black woman Place your foot on my other cheek While he was on the ground As a sign of humility that you're placing your foot on my face And Bilal said, my brother, stand up, may Allah forgive you These are some of the incidents where the Prophet ﷺ Expressed and portrayed his anger Not for himself, rather for the religion of Allah In the defense of Allah Governed and controlled by the Shari'ah of Allah Because I don't want people to come and say Okay, I want to become angry like the Prophet ﷺ For the sake of Allah, in the cause of Allah Let's burn a house, let's break a property Let's turn, let's attack the authorities No, this is not what the Prophet ﷺ did This is not what Islam promotes or endorses Being angry is controlled by Shari'ah And not by the cause of hooligans and thugs Like we find in some Muslim countries All of a sudden demonstrations and protests And burning of property and destruction This is not part of Islam And this is definitely not part of the sunnah Of the Prophet ﷺ We have a short break, stay tuned And inshallah we'll be right back"
