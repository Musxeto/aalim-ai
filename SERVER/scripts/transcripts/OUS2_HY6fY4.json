  "transcript": "He would also smile and maybe laugh when people misbehave with him. In an incident, Anas ibn Malik tells us that while he was walking with the Prophet ﷺ and the Prophet was wearing a cloak made of harsh wool and he had nothing underneath it, and all of a sudden a nomad came from behind the Prophet ﷺ, startling him, grabbing him from his cloak and pulling him in a harsh way to the extent that it affected his neck and shoulder. You can see traces of it on his skin. Not only that, he also addressed the Prophet ﷺ in a disrespectful way by saying, O Muhammad, give me from the money you have, it is Allah's money, not yours. What is this? Such an attitude, if any of us would have been addressed by it, probably we would have made a fight out of it. Not the Prophet ﷺ. The Prophet looked at him and he laughed, smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something. He gave him a cloak and he said, O Muhammad, give me from the money you have, it is Allah's money, not yours. He gave him a cloak and he laughed, smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something. He gave him a cloak and he laughed, smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something. He gave him a cloak and he laughed, smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something. He gave him a cloak and he laughed, smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something. He gave him a cloak and he laughed, smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something. He gave him a cloak and he laughed, smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something. He gave him a cloak and he laughed, smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something."
