  "title": "40 Day Rule to Cut Hair and Nails, what if they grow fast? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdullah from the US Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam My question is that for males that are like in the teenage age, is it, I heard there's like a 40 day rule to cut the pubic hairs, so is it, and I'm pretty sure that the people in this age, they don't grow the pubic hairs that fast as adults do, so my question is does this 40 day rule still apply for us? Yes, the ruling applies for adults, grown-ups, teenage, males, females. The Hadith of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ï·º timed for us not more than 40 days to clip our fingernails, to pluck our armpit hair, to shave our pubic hair, etc. This is an authentic Hadith by Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, which means that this is the max 40 days, but if the pubic hair grows a lot in 10 days, then you do this and you shave it as well without any problem."
