  "transcript": "Adan from Bangladesh shum if someone does an act of kufur and then he repents but in his heart he knows that that if if that sin was just a ma major sin and not an act of kufur he would have done it so is his repentance accepted just it is accepted because he repented from kufur if he were to think that this is not kufur probably he would not have repented from it this has nothing to do with repenting from kufur because kufur is kufur takes him out of the fold of Islam he is wrong in wanting to do it if it's just merely a major sin but no one says that this impacts his repentance"
