  "title": "Number of Witr rakat after Isha? Assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Zulkar from Bangladesh. He says,   what are the number of Witr raka'āts \nwe should pray after 'Isha? The Prophet   (alayhi salatu wa salam) said to us that, the \nminimum number of raka'āts recommended is 1.   So if you pray 'Isha prayer, and you pray 2 \nraka'āt sunnah of 'Isha, this is also highly   recommended not mandatory, and you pray 1 \nraka'āt of Witr - this does the job. It's   considered to be your portion of night prayer. \nHe, however, used to pray 11 raka'āts every   night. Not necessarily after 'Isha, rather before \nFajr time so it's in the last third of the night.   And he (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) did not \nlimit night prayer to 11 raka'āts, rather he   made it open when he said, 'The night \nprayer is composed of 2 by 2 by 2',   indefinitely. When it comes to the technical \nterm Witr, the Prophet used to offer Witr   (alayhi salatu wa salam) as the following; Either \n1 raka'āt (with Tashahhud and Salam), 3 raka'āts   either praying 2 with salam then praying the \nthird with a separate salam, or praying all three   like Maghrib, but without sitting in the \nmiddle for the first Tashahhud. Rather,   only sitting at the last raka'āt. He used \nto also pray 5 raka'āts Witr continuously   without sitting, except in the fifth raka'āt. \nAnd he also used to pray 7 raka'āts continuously   without sitting for Tashahhud, \nexcept in the last seventh raka'āt.   And finally, he used to pray 9 continuous raka'āts \nsitting on the eighth and doing first Tashahhud,   standing up to the ninth and then sitting on the \nninth for the final Tashahhud and offering Salam."
