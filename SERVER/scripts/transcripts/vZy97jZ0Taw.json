  "transcript": "Zainab from Pakistan. Sheikh, I wanted to ask that is it actually Kuffar or is it just an opinion of minority scholars that if we act to pray for someone like human, so does it become Kuffar? What do you mean by that? Can you give an example? Like I act for some time that I am praying for someone, for a human like my father or someone. Praying like what? Praying in Dua? Oh Allah forgive my father? No, Salah. Salah, you're worshipping your father? If someone acts because of some reason. You did not answer me. Are you worshipping your father when you're offering Salah like this to him? So how do you offer Salah for your father? Like you show them that you are praying. So you're pretending to pray to Allah just so your father would get off your case and not scold you for not praying. Correct? That's not the exact reason but like something like that. No, this is Riya, this is not Kuffar. This is Riya and showing off and this is one of the major sins of Islam. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
