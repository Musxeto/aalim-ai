  "title": "Can a person who is praying alone recite Quran LOUDLY so he can focus properly",
  "transcript": "Burak from Turkey. But I pray, I read the Fath and the Surah after loudly because it's the only way that I can focus in my Salah. Is this permissible or haram? Are you praying alone or in congregation? Alone. This is permissible but it is against the Sunnah in silent Raka'ah. Meaning if you do this in the Fajr Salat, this is the Sunnah. If you do it in the first two Raka'ahs of Maghreb and Isha, this is the Sunnah. But if you do it in Asr or Dhuhr or the last two Raka'ahs of Isha, this is not from the Sunnah. Does it have any impact on your Salat and the validity? The answer is no. Your prayer is 100% perfect and valid. Should I continue? The answer is no. Why? As long as my prayer is valid because this is a loophole where Satan is going to come through. After a while, he will not make you satisfied by doing this alone. He would say, hmm, you should say, Subhanarabbiyal Azeem, Subhanarabbiyal A'ala, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli, Rabbigfirli,"
