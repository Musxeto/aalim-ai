  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Sheikh since my father passed away so my mother and my adult younger sister they do not have any available mahram to accompany them whenever they travel to another city however my sister frequently needs to travel for various legitimate purposes and is staying for a few days this time for example she would travel at least five different days in this month inshallah so basically I drop her off return home then travel again to bring her back sometimes my mother also has to travel individually so I accompany her as well but Sheikh each round trip by bus would take around 10 hours on average and I really find it difficult as I have my own work to do and when I will start doing job inshallah normally an office does not permit so much leaves so given this situation what should I do now Sheikh? Allah says Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear you're not obliged to accompany them in what they want unless it is a life and death situation they need to go to a hospital they need to have a surgery going for work going for a ledger going for visitation no you're not obliged to accompany them when there is a huge risk and hardship on you and Allah azawajal knows best but you try your level best to compromise and reconcile to the best of your ability"
