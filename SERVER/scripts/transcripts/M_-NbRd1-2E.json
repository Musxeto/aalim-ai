  "title": "Store food for a year due to a great famine, & 15 Ramadan trumpet blast will occur & only 70,000 peo",
  "transcript": "Riyal from Bangladesh Sheikh, people nowadays are very much concerned about Shami Shush. Like, in the Day of Islam, they talk about that there will rise a star named Julfik in the eastern sky. And after rising the star, it is said to the people to store food for one year, because there will come a great famine. And on 15 Ramadan, I don't know in which year of Ramadan, but it is said that a trumpet blast will occur and people are said to stay home and 70,000 people will leave and so many things. So, are these statements true or fabricated? Please clarify the issues. It is all fabricated and parts of what the soothsayers are saying. Believing them and thinking that people know the unseen is kufr. So, you have to ignore such statements and not pay attention to it. Shukran If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they are poor, I will give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it, In Sha Allah, within the following two days or three days. And, bi-idhnillah, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah. Al-Fatiha."
