  "transcript": "from Pakistan I require you full attention I wanted to purchase a much needed smart geizer from a company and contacted its official own store I need you to State your question in one sentence please I don't have time to listen to an essay and a full story please don't do this on live television and don't do it in private ask a specific question what's the ruling on 1 + 1 equal 2 and I will answer you okay so uh basically I contacted this store and the I was not satisfied with the customer sales representative service right she was a female and um I ended up abusing her so um I contact later I okay that they had uh probably decided that they're not going to give you Services right so I had this opinion that probably that girl or or their team or maybe the entire company number of another staff member in short which she had sent me way earlier before we had that argument which was a person from another section so suppose I told him kindly inform me which of the dealers or stores currently have that product kindly let me know but do not invol or inform that so and so lady because I had a misunderstanding with her earlier but the M mistake that I did was that I did not tell him that either the woman or a team or the company overall had decided to refuse me services so later I felt like um I probably cheated or deceived or maybe I should have informed this person maybe then he would not have given me the services because he gave me the number of a dealer and till now I've not been able to contact him I even apologize to that woman but it has not been off my mind so am I guilty for this was I supposed to announce to the other uh company member that um you know one section of the company probably decided to refuse okay I got your question you're sinful for abusing that woman and for misbehaving with her if they rejected to give you the service and you went through a back door to someone else who does not know the ins and outs this is their mistake because they should have reported it on you and they have uh should have known that you are a troublemaker and not give you the service because they failed in uh doing so I believe that you have no problem in availing from their services but you have to fear Allah and remember that you will face all your actions and what you've said in your grave when you meet Allah always be I of this fact and this would clear a lot of your doubts and confusion so that you don't have to ask about it in the future and Allah Knows Best"
