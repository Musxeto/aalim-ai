  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. So, I do have a selection of books that I read and hum the lines, Jazak Allah Khair. After listening to a lot of your lectures, I've learned a little bit more. And when I started to read some of the books, I came across something that I'm not sure if it's correct and if I should keep the book, burn it, or throw it away. It says that a letter bar that it belongs to, I think, Ali Rukiab Al-Hani. And also the time of the prayer, he said, Al-Insha Allah, you can pray until the Fajr of the next day. So, are these books okay for me to keep or give it to someone or I should burn them? I did not understand what you have read. What is it again? So, it says that the letter bar, the dot in the bar of Bismillah, it's referring to Ali Rukiab Al-Hani. No, no, this is totally bogus. Of course, you have to get rid of such a book. Because what kind of knowledge do people try to pollute in people's minds? Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, is the fourth rightly guided caliph. His seeding is number four. All Muslims agree that Abu Bakr is the best after the Prophet, peace be upon him. Then Umar, then Uthman, and finally Ali, may Allah be pleased with him. So, to come and have the audacity to claim that the Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Rahim, the dot in the letter B, Bismillah, which is underneath, is referring to Ali. What kind of nonsense is this? It's the same interpretation of the Rafidah, when they say, Maraj Al-Bahrain Yaltaqiyan. Allah has merged and joined the two seas. They say, oh, this is Ali and Fatima. And, Yakhruj Minhum Al-Lu'lu Wal-Marjan. So, the pearls and the corals come out of these two seas. They said, yeah, this is referring to Al-Hasan and Al-Hussein. This is nonsense. This is tafsir batini, and it's blasphemous, and it has nothing to relate to Islam. So, ditch these books and throw them away. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah. Al-Fatiha."
