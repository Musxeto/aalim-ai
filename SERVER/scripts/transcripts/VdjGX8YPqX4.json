  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Lebanon so my \nquestion is we know that the dua [ __ ] it is mentioned in the hadith that it can \nforgive you even if you like flee from the   battlefield which is a major sin so does this \nentail that this to offer gives major sins for   an individual even though we know like Hajj only \nforgives minor sins this Dua does not mean it   erases or forgives major sins without repentance \nbut with repentance it may and the ma the vast   majority of Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'a Allah they \nall agree that that major sense require repentance   and when they come to this Dua they find it \nproblematic because whoever says this Dua Is   Forgiven even if he flees so to combine it would \nbe that it requires repentance with the Dua and   this is to combine all the contradicting evidences \nbecause as you've stated prayer to prayer Ramadan   to Ramadan would expiate what between them as \nlong as a person does not commit major sins   so Hajj by all means is greater than this Dua \nnobody doubts this praying five times a day is   greater than this Dua without any doubt so this is \nthe only way to understand it and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All foreign"
