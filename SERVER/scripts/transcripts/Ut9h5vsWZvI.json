  "title": "Is praising Kafirs KUFR, I say Shahada 30 times a day! assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Arjan from Germany or Argun? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam from Turkey? No, I'm Arjan from Germany. Okay, how can I help you? Sheikh, I have a question. I said in the day maybe 30 times shahada because I think always that I make shiukh or kufr or something like that because when I say for example to a disbeliever strong shot or maybe something like that I think this is praising the disbelievers and then I have waswasa that is kufr what I make. No, it's not kufr. It's not kufr and it is obvious my friend that you have a severe case of OCD that has been marinating for the past eight months to a year or more and shaitan has finally reached the final recipe and now he is implementing it. All of these doubts you're getting are nonsense. Saying to a kafir good shot is not praising his kufr, is praising his shooting ability or profession in his game. There's nothing wrong in that. There's no praising of his belief in trinity or that Allah has an associate with him. That would be kufr. And saying 35 shahadahs a day shows that there is something wrong up there. There are a number of short circuit fuses that needs to be replaced. So I would highly recommend that you book a counseling session with me if you can afford it or go to any Muslim knowledgeable imam who would knowledgeable imam who would entertain your case and solve it for you In Sha Allah."
