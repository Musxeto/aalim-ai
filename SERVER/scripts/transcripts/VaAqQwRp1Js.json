  "title": "Is it haram to Keep Birds in cages and Fish as Pets? Any reward for Buying birds and Freeing them?",
  "transcript": "Zechariah says is it how long to keep birds and fish as pets some scholars say that it is permissible but I want to be sure because keeping a creature of Allah that was meant to fly in a cage seems sadistic to me just like the hadith of the woman who imprisoned her cat is there a reward for buying Birds and freeing them Zechariah first of all I would like to thank you for asking and it is good always to ask when you are in doubt however I'd like also to give you an advice not to put your judgment and give your verdict without basing it on the Quran Sunnah there was no need for saying that I feel that this is sadistic to put a bird in a cage and prevent it from flying now this is your feeling but is it based on Quran and Sunnah the answer is no so what's wrong in saying what I feel well a lot of the people begin like this and unfortunately they are not as fortunate as you there as they are not as smart as you to ask a lot of the people make their conclusions and act upon them and they think that it is final they take their own whims and desires for granted so you get people putting assumptions speculations and building their convictions upon them and acting upon that you get people saying that animals have souls we're not allowed to torture them but plants also according to scientific research have souls and they get feelings and they showed how a plant can feel and therefore walking on grass is not permissible I got a question by the way a couple of days ago of someone saying those who play soccer or football as we call it on grass are they sinful because they are running on grass and they're hurting the feelings of grass what is this so people put their speculations as convictions and they act upon them and this is totally out of the question you did the right thing by asking but I wish that you did not put forward your view and saying that it is it is sadistic no it is not if it were sadistic then people vegetarians vegans would come and say slaughtering animals is sadistic how do you feed on another creature so I tell them okay you guys are feeding on vegetables and there are creatures as well how do you eat vegetables that Allah created to live and to be in the open air how do you deprive animals from their own food by eating it oh this is nonsense so coming back to the question is it sadistic guys there's no the woman you mentioned in the hadith was admitted to hell because not because she kept a kitten a cat in her house because she did not feed the cat and she prevented the cat from going out she locked it in to prevent it from going out and eating from the insects and from whatever is she can find outdoors this is why she would was admitted to hell keeping a bird in a cage keeping fish in a fish tank in an aquarium this is permissible as long as you're feeding it and taking care of it and not torturing it or allowing children to abuse it this is totally permissible in sahih al-bukhari and Assam know Malik may Allah be pleased with him had a young brother of four or five years of age and the Prophet used to visit the house often and he nicked named the boy as about male and he had a small bird nor and the bird was in a cage in Medina and the bird died so the boy was saddened so the Prophet came as Sam and he gave his condolences to the child by joking with him and nicknaming him and saying about a mile mattify Island know where he's saying Oh am i what did the small bird do and the child would cry and say that the bird died and the Prophet I assume used to console him with that so this is totally permissible to have a bird in your house to have an aquarium in your house look at the beautiful fish swimming putting food for them it's something that calls you to praise allah azza wajal would I be rewarded if I buy Birds and set them free I personally think that you won't because such birds are used to living in specific environment and by setting them free they'll be hunted or they'll die out of poverty of hunger because they're not used to the environment that they are set free in so putting them in a cave and giving them food that would be much better and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best if you have extra money you can give it always to the poor Muslims and they would benefit more than the birds"
