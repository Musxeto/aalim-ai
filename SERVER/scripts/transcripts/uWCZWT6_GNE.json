  "transcript": "Okay, Sheikh, some of the viewers, they are Christians, when they see you come to Indonesia, they said, I believe they also see your videos before, and they say, ah, this is the Sheikh who hates Christians. Have you ever said something like that, Sheikh? Maybe in a different context? Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, Alhamdulillah, Wasalatu Wassalamu Ala Rasoolillahi Wa Alihi Wa Sahbihi, Wa Minah Ittada Bi Huda, Amma Ba'd. The issue of love and hate is different from one person to the other, from one level to the other, and it's looked upon from different angles. So it is very unfair to say that I hate or I love without understanding what is meant by that. So what is meant by that? In Islam, we are ordered to love for the sake of Allah and to hate for the sake of Allah. What does this mean? It means that if someone is in accordance to the teachings of Allah, the Almighty God, and he's complying to his law, we love that individual, whether he's Muslim or non-Muslim. And if there is a Muslim who is doing all the good things, avoiding all the haram things, we give him our full love, loyalty, and devotion. Likewise, if there is someone who disbelieves in Allah and who also insults our religion, I cannot love this person. I, according to Islamic law, the Quran, and the Sunnah, I'm obliged to hate him, but hating him does not mean I should be violent or I should do him wrong or I should oppress him. This is all unacceptable in my deen, my religion. So what does it mean by hating him? Meaning I hate his disbelief. I hate the sins he's doing. Even if he's a Muslim and he is sinful and he is oppressing people, I hate in him this oppression and this injustice. But I love in him that he's kind, that he's generous, that he is courageous, etc. So to say that I hate Christians just because they are Christians, this is unrealistic. I have a lot of Christian friends, and they know me and they visit me, they invite me, I invite them. Are we best of friends? Of course not. Do I love them and try my level best to help them and go out of my way? No. I do this with my Muslim brothers, but hating their disbelief, hating their kufr is what every single Muslim has towards everyone who is a disbeliever. Not because of their color of their eyes or the fairness of their skin, rather because of their actions. The moment they become Muslims, they become our brothers and beloved ones to us. Thank you very much. This is very clear. So whenever we hate Christians or love Christians, we have to see it from certain angles. www.mooji.org"
