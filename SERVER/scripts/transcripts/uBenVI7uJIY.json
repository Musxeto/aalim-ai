  "transcript": "neam from Kashmir asalamu alikum shum regarding my question I already watched YouTube video of yours but I would like to clarify some more things regarding to it actually before uh 3 weeks uh I got some very bad thoughts regarding some Pious Souls of our Dean uh mainly Messengers but right uh right that time I didn't know that uh this this situation is known by the name waswas then from many videos uh I got know that uh there is nothing to worry about it and uh it is only it only happens to those who are believers now I would like to know that whenever these thoughts come to my mind what should I do because I feel like bullets are piercing my heart when these uh thoughts come to my mind and I Stern my body so firm n nilam who is giving you these thoughts shaan is Shan your friend or enemy he's my enemy are you obeying him when you listen to these thoughts or disobeying him I'm disobeying him then block it this is what Shan does if you go to LinkedIn and find his job description you will find that my job description is to take you with me to Hellfire on the day of judgment as simple as that so he is doing whatever he does till the day of judgment for you personally till you die I he will continue to do this over and over and over again throwing WIS swash in your head whether it is through sh or kufur or Salat or Purity or wo or doing things over and over again regardless he will throw these Whispers until your soul leaves your body this is his job description so if you know that these thoughts are from your enemy and you know that he wants to take you to Hellfire what is the logical thing to do ignore it block it if he says to you stand up you sit if he says go left you go right it's not rocket science"
