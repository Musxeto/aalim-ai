  "transcript": "it's from an anonymous who says i'm a 20 year old girl and i find my dad cheating that is having conversations with a non-muslim woman and it is intimate like how a couple speaks and my mom isn't aware of this i couldn't bear this behavior of my father and he has no idea that i have uh known about this i have no courage to openly speak up on this to him or share with someone who can speak to him i'm really worried about my dad first of all i'm presuming that you accidentally found something that was dubious or inappropriate now what follows defines whether you will be punished for that or not what you found accidentally if you continue to investigate and read and scroll down and search other places to know and learn more this is called spying and you're definitely committing a major sin and you'll be tormented for that unless you ask allah for forgiveness you repent and you do not disclose this to anyone if you didn't scroll down and investigate and all of this was merely speculations yes you read a line and you thought that this might be an affair that your father is having this is doubt and this is also something that is sinful which allah azzawajal prohibited us from falling into egypt avoid a lot of different types of doubt for some of it is sinful this is some of it so we avoid the full majority the whole majority because of that therefore you cannot tell your mother because this would break your parents marriage or at least cause a lot of distress and problems in it especially when you don't have concrete evidence and this is defined in islam as slaundering even if you go through their chat and discover inappropriate conversations does this mean that he is an adulterer having an affair with this non-muslim woman or a muslim woman it doesn't matter haram is haram regardless of the religion if you have a confession of him saying this when asked or for male witnesses testifying seeing the actual graphic process being performed with their eyes in person only then you can slander him or accuse him of adultery otherwise it's slander and the penalty of slander is 80 lashes being flogged 80 lashes and this is to the muslim ruler to execute so what to do well you are stuck between a rock and a hard place the best for you is one try to send him personally make sure that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands a letter that is anonymous who sent it warning him of what he's doing reminding him of allah and explaining to him the consequences this would have on his marriage and his family or you can always when you are sitting with your father discuss with him few fictional stories you make about a friend and how this friend father fell into a similar situation and how it caused the marriage to to break etc and you makes make up such a story in order for him to feel the impact and understand the gravity of what he's doing now wouldn't that be lying it would be lying but it is done for a better cause for a legitimate reason like in the case of war like in the case of a man lying to his wife so that the love would increase like in the case when you're trying to reconcile between two people and you're trying to reconcile between your father and his lord in allah azza or between your father and his wife and allah sojourn knows best you"
