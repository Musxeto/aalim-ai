  "title": "Can we Pray Behind an Imam who Prays Witr Prayer like Maghrib? Assim Al-Hakeem",
  "transcript": "muhammad from the us i wanted to know uh in the masjid i got to pray after tarawih they prayed with their prayer they sit in the second bathroom the you know the islam so that you will cash out and send that into the car like moderate prayer so should i leave before better there and pray at home or what should i do in that case the vast majority of scholars say that offering witter in the same format as maghrib prayer is not permissible and they have a hadith which was authenticated by alhava bin hajir may allah have mercy on his soul and other scholars only the hanafi school of thought go against this so if you were to go and pray in a hanafi masjid and the imam who's most likely is a layman doesn't know he just follows what his forefathers found and he prays whitter exactly like he prays maghrib what should we do as followers scholars say that we should follow the imam and the sin is on him if any and there is no sin on us because our imam follows a reputable school of thought and he has his ishti had if he believes that this is the right thing to do then as his congregation we must follow him and our reward will be complete inshaallah you"
