  "title": "Sniffed water up the nose in Wudu & swallowed , fast valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salman from India. Sheikh, I know the Hadith that we don't need to go to extreme while raising nose in wudu while fasting. So I inhaled water very slowly and carefully in wudu, but I mistakenly swallowed it. Now I am not sure if water went inside my throat or not, but I am inclined that it may have got inside. So should I add this fasting after eat, considering the fact that I have OCD and waswas in almost all Islamic practices, but Alhamdulillah I am better now. The answer is no. Your fast is valid. The restriction not to exaggerate while inhaling the water up your nostrils and blowing it out as for the Hadith of Laqeet ibn Sabur, may Allah be pleased with him, this is to not fall in such a mistake. But if you have done such a thing and you swallowed water, this was unintentional. So no one says that your fasting is invalid, because it is unintentional. Therefore, continue your fasting without a problem. But try to be more careful next time. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
