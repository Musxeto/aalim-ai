  "transcript": "hajj is both physical and financial so you have to do this once in a lifetime so if you do it do it with utmost sincerity only seek allah's face by it and do your level not to brag and not to show off and not to boast about it don't fall into the same mistake that many muslims do one of satan's traps where they keep on taking selfies and they step by step publish on their instagram or snapchat or their social media facebook or whatever everything they do and now i'm going to take to raka tahiti and now i'm going to drink zamzam water here we are in arafat what a beautiful sight here we're doing this we're doing that who are you addressing my friend some may say that this is a form of dawah it can be but not for everyone and only allah azzawajal only allah knows your intention so be careful from falling into the traps of shaytan make your deeds sincere for his sake and this is a one life journey one in a lifetime journey that you must try your level best to be accepted because if you succeed you will be one of the lucky ones whom allah erases all of their sins as if it is the day their mother bore them but if you failed you've lost time energy money and gained a lot of sins in the process i pray to allah that he grants me and you a sincere hajj and that he accepts all of our deeds and makes them all for his sake you"
