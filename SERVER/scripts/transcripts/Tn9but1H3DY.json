  "title": "Need to build credit score â€” can I get a couple of credit cards? ðŸ’³ assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sam from Canada. Uh she in the west um nowadays just having one credit card can be a little bit difficult in terms of building credit scores. So some people they get like two or three credit cards. Is this okay providing that the person has yakin that they can pay it off on time or is this like even having a credit card to begin with is not okay in this country in the west? Why why do you need to build your credit Sam? Uh so what people say is that you know to get a car to finance sometimes they don't even accept debit cards in this country or you know just even if you're traveling hotels don't accept it or No no no no no. I'm not asking about why do you get a credit card? I said why do you need to build your credit? because to my understanding in America and north uh in Canada as well they want to build their credit with the banks so that when the banks look at their 10 years of track record and they see that they've been borrowing through the credit card and paying on time when they apply for mortgage or for a haram interestbased loan the bank says he's got good credit because of his track record. So if this is the intention then the answer is no definitely not it's not permissible at all to build such a credit because the intention is halam but if you need a credit card a single credit card because you can't rent a car or book a ticket on a plane or even get a hotel reservation without a credit card. You may get one not to get multiple because the multiple means the more risk of you defaulting on payments on time and it means that you are supporting them more and more so more based on haram are benefiting from your contribution."
