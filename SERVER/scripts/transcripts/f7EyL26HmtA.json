  "title": "Did the Prophet â€Žï·º  ever hear music ðŸŽ¶ ?",
  "transcript": "We are told that the Prophet ï·º had never ever committed a major sin. And there are few narrations that say or tell us that the Prophet ï·º once attempted to go to the city and do what everybody else does, you know, to have some fun. And we were told that he once asked one of his colleagues to take care of his sheep and he went to town just before sunset. And as he was going into town, just before going into their clubs, he heard some music coming from a nearby wedding. So he listened to the music and he fell asleep and woke up the following morning as the sun was in the middle of the sky. So he knew that it was not meant to be for him to associate himself with such joyfulness that may lead to something that is not permissible."
