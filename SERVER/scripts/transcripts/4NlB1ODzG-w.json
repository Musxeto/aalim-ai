  "transcript": "muhammad and he says if i teach someone anything that deals with the religion for example how to pray etc will i get a copy of his rewards whenever he prays does the same ruling apply to sins well muhammad the hadith answers your question the prophet said alaihis wasallam whoever revives a good sunnah then he will have its reward and the rewards of everyone who follows it until the day of judgment without reducing any of their rewards and whoever revives a bad sunnah a bad deed then he would have its burden and the burden and the sins of everyone who follows him till the day of judgment without any of their bad deeds being reduced or missed this is why the prophet allah is the highest of all humans and of all allah's creation in reward because all what we do in practice which came to us through him will be accredited to him without deducting anything from our good deeds and likewise if anyone would kill someone the first son of adam who killed his brother would be accredited for that sin so you can do the math and this is why usually practicing righteous parents they compete on teaching their children how to recite the fatih how to pray how to learn the shahada the basics because they know as the children grow and practice these things they will be accredited for it while they are dead in their graves and it is indeed frightening and scary when you do sins call people to follow you and they do you will be accumulating so many bad deeds and sins that you will be shocked and terrified on the day of judgment when you see the amount of sins that you have compiled upon yourself because of calling others to follow suit so this hadith should throw some fear in the hearts of the people of entertainment actors actresses singers songwriters musicians those who sell haram things tobacco etc those who facilitate sins for for others yes you're gonna be paid in this life maybe handsomely but imagine all the sins you've compiled and a lot of them would say it's okay i'll take one umrah and this erases everything and this is not the case all the time so one has to be really careful of what he sends forward to his grave and to the hereafter because he will definitely meet that"
