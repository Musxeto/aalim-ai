  "transcript": "uh zainab from Pakistan I wanted to ask that is necessary for surah's father in Salah for example can I say just or do I have to remember the pronunciation of thank you I did not get your answer a question properly is what necessary for your Salat exact pronunciation Okay in Arabic means the the place where the letter is coming out in your uh throat so it has to do with fanatics linguistically it has to do with fanatics but not everyone is capable of uttering and saying the word properly so a lot of the non-arabs cannot says this is their best of our ability say it ball lean said darling even some Arabs cannot say an AMTA and that's why a lot of those who practice would say repeat it repeated it repeated so many times until they perfect it and it becomes natural so it is essential if you're able but if it's going to develop into an OCD and you end up saying in the prayer is whoa what are you doing this is not Salat you've totally went out of the purpose of Salat now you're focusing on just pronouncing one letter or no concentration no feeling of Allah no this is not the right thing to do do it to the best of your ability if this is the best of your ability and I'm telling him Carlos move on don't stress it and say no I have to perfect it not in Salat perfect it outside of the Salat and then when you pray make the prayer flow easily insha Allah"
