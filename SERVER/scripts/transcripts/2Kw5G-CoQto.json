  "title": "Can we play a cracked game available on the internet? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ahnaf from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh there is a game that is cracked and made available for anyone to play online. There is no need to go to any sketchy pirate websites to get it, rather it's easily accessible just by a Google search. Is it allowed to download and play the game in this case? If this is a game that is available on the internet and it's halal, there's nothing haram in it, the manufacturers, if they wanted to copyright it, they would have blocked that from Google or from that website or they would have sued them. Being willing to do this makes it available for everyone to share and to use and hence I have no problem in using it. It's like going to a public library and picking up a book and reading it. I don't have copyrights and the book's author has copyrights but they gave access to it and I don't have the ability to check every article I read on the internet whether it's copyrighted or not. So what's available and I have not hacked into it, I have not cracked it and I'm not intentionally attempting to steal people's rights, I see no problem in utilizing that and Allah knows best."
