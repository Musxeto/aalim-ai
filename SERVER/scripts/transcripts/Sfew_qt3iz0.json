  "title": "Walking on carpet with shoes make it najis? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the first email is from Sultana and she says if someone walks on the carpet with their shoes on has that place become neji's if I want to pray there now when we would like to talk a little bit about this so that people would have sufficient knowledge because such questions are so basic and it is a form it is mandatory upon you as a believer as a Muslim to know these issues of purity of Tahara of when to pray and when not to pray this is basics ABC of Islam so you have to learn this and you have to be knowledgeable there is no excuse for you not to know so I know I'm gonna take a lot of time but it is something that has to be done the question is clear someone walked on my carpet with his shoes so can I pray or is cos considered to be impurity impure place to pray in definition of impurity impurity is known in Arabic as an ijazah and it refers to the physical impurity because we have the sentimental or the moral impurity with which is something different we're not going to talk about that but physical impurity is urine or human beings or of animals that we cannot and we're not allowed to eat their meat the the urine the feces the menstrual blood of human beings or the men√≠s the blood of animals that we're not allowed to eat the meat or the blood that is running or gushing when slaughtering from a halal animal these are the things that are known as nagisa physical if I want to pray one of the conditions of Prayer is that my body my clothes and the area I'm praying on does not have any nagisa the problem is that people usually mix-up Natasa with something that is dirty so I could have a t-shirt that is dirty but I can still pray in it why it is dirty because it has oil stains on it I changed the car oil and I have stains on it it's smelly because I did not take a shower and I was sweaty and I wore it a couple of times or three times so it has a bad smell by all standards this is dirty yet it is not necess that just means impurity and I could have a clean dress a clean table a clean shirt but it has a tiny Manute drop of urine that renders it to be nudges I cannot pray and if I pray my prayer is invalid combine this with the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam when he where he said that allah has made the earth the ground for me a means of purification there is truth amo and a place to pray so whenever a person has to pray can pray anywhere and with the hadith of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam where he said pray in your sandals and when ever one of you wants to pray in his sandals he should look at it meaning at the soil to ensure that there is no impurity and then pray this is sunnah to pray with your shoes on with your sandals on providing that there are no natasa apparent on it with all these previously said if you come to the carpet in your house someone walked on it with his boots left traces of sanders or soil or dust or whatever do I see any visible Natasa for certain the answer is no you can pray this means I can pray in a showroom I can pray in a classroom I can play in the corridor I can play in the Airport wherever I want to pray because the ground is means of prayer for me and I hope this answers your question"
