  "transcript": "Shahrukh from Singapore. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. So there's a hadith that says that take up good deeds only as much as you are able for the best deeds are those done regularly even if they are few. So I was a little confused by this. Let's say if I have I'm relatively freer than my usual work. I have some time on my hands. So on my usual days, let's say when I'm working, I read half a juice daily. But now because I'm free, I have more time. I can read like a full juice daily. Similarly, now I'm free so I can fast alternate days. Usually I fast only on Mondays and Thursdays. So is this like all right or is there or should I like? Okay, Shahrukh, this is totally right and correct and valid. The hadith is referring to burdening yourself beyond its ability. This is the prohibition. So when someone says, okay, I will fast every single day. The Prophet said, no, this is not part of the sunnah. If someone says, I'll pray from Isha till Fajr. The Prophet said, no, haram. You have to go to bed. If someone says, I'm not going to marry at all. I'm going to be single for the rest of my life. The Prophet says, no, this is burdening yourself with something that Allah did not oblige upon you. You see, when you are having time and increasing good deeds within your ability, this is totally right, logical, valid and accepted by Allah Azza wa Jal and Allah knows best."
