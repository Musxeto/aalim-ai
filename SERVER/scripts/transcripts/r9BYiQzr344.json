  "title": "Anas Ibn Malik’s errand for the Prophet ‎ﷺ  assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salatu Wassalam. But he would not lie. He would also not reprimand his servants or the children. Anas ibn Malik says, one day the Prophet ﷺ sent me on an errand and I embedded in myself not to go. I wanted to play. I wanted to have some time off. So I saw a group of children playing. So I stood there watching them and maybe wanting to play with them when all of a sudden I had someone holding me from my neck, from behind me. And I looked and it was the Prophet ﷺ laughing. And he said, Unais, his name is Anas. Unais is the smaller version of the name. Unais, did you go where I ordered you to do or to go? So I said, yes, O Prophet of Allah, I'm going now. And the Prophet ﷺ let him go laughing."
