  "title": "Father leaves to the Masjid without me, I told him to FEAR ALLAH, & is he sinful? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Faiz from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, it's a good question. So a lot of times you know when you know it's during masjid it's just a lot of times it's just me and my dad but you know like whenever my father whenever he's like not in a good mood and things like that you know so because it's like a little far so you have to like take a car go over there but like a lot of times like he would just leave without me or he wouldn't even ask me to go to the masjid so is he sinful because I try to remind him about it to you know fear Allah and like what he's doing but he'd say things like oh no I wouldn't be questioned I'm going to jannah and things like that I don't want to go too much in detail. Well I wouldn't answer you without knowing the background because if I were to ask your father he would most likely say Sheikh I wake him up for salat and he is so lazy and he delays in waking up and if I wait for him I'm going to lose the first row or I'm going to lose the rakah or two I may lose the whole prayer so I've tried so many times to ask him to man up and he wouldn't so definitely there's no sin on him and if the masjid is within your vicinity that is a walking distance of 10 minutes or 15 minutes he's not obliged to wait for you you're an adult you're a man you can walk but if it is further than that it's not mandatory upon you to pray in the masjid it's all about demand and supply if you were really sincere and eager to go to the masjid you wake up early you prepare early you're ready before he's ready and then it's a win-win situation"
