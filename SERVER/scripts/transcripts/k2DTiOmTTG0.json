  "transcript": "and Sin. Did he give up? If you were in jail for 10 years, wouldn't you feel deprived of Allah's mercy? Why Allah is doing this to me? Never give up. Never mistrust Allah. Never feel alone. He's always positive. What did he do? He started giving dawah to the inmates in jail and they all accepted Islam and they all returned to Allah. He's always positive and this is what a Muslim really is. Blessed wherever he is. This is a Muslim. He's blessed at work. He's blessed at school. He's blessed at home. He's blessed in his neighborhood. He's blessed in the masjid. Even when he goes to the gym, he's blessed. Akhi, you're wearing a necklace. This is haram. Akhi, you are not praying. It's prayer time. Come. Akhi, your aura is exposed. Akhi, you're doing this. You're doing that. And with diplomacy and with kindness and with compassion, everybody would love you and you will be blessed like all the messengers of Allah."
