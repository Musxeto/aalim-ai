  "transcript": "Omar from Lebanon Sheikh I just have a question now because especially during our, this is the end times so there is a lot of evil going on. So I saw some hadith that says that give glad tidings to the one who didn't see me but believed in me, like seven glad tidings and at the same time like the one who holds this deen in this time will get like the reward of 50 companions. So my question is does this mean like we have a chance for like you know to get a lot of good deeds just like the three favorite generation had? Like to get the high status and stuff if we stick to the deen? And Jazakumullah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. Of course Omar, there is a very big chance that we will be rewarded as the companions may Allah be pleased with them but this would not mean that we will be in the same status because we can do a lot of good deeds. The quality of the deeds we're doing are unmatched to the quality of the deeds of the companions. So even if the companions did this much, even if we do that this much it would not be the same. Why? The Prophet said alayhi salatu wasalam, said in an authentic hadith, do not hurt or harm my companions for if one of you were to give as much as Mount Uhud in gold for charity that would not be equivalent to a mud from one of them or even half a mud. So imagine this much of wheat or barley in charity from them is still greater than Mount Uhud of gold from us. And that hadith was by the way addressing Khalid ibn Walid who was a great companion not to say or do anything against Abdurrahman ibn Auf who was one of the 10 heaven bound not between Abdurrahman ibn Auf and us so you can see the difference. Therefore yes the Prophet is giving us the glad tidings of no matter what we do it's going to be magnified and multiplied and much much more as if this is the doing of 50 of the companions yet our status is still unmatched compared to the companions because they are way up there but we are hopeful in Allah's generosity. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you. If you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
