  "transcript": "all right without further delay delaying i would like to invite hakeem to enlighten us from [Music] the ummah of islam is undergoing a period of weakness and humility that was unprecedented though as a nation we have all what is needed to be superior yet we are unfortunately at the end of the list nobody cares about us nobody pays us any attention instead of being leaders the muslims today are followers and this is fulfilling the prophecy which the prophet had said in the authentic hadith all the nations are about to collaborate upon you like when a beast when an animal when a pet is going to eat from a plate it has everybody's collaborating upon you there will come a time so one of the companions may allah agrees with them ask oh prophet of allah are we few in number the prophet said no you're so many yet you are a quantity not quality you're like the foam that rises on top of flood water and you have no value and allah will extract the fear of you from your enemy's chest and allah will throw in your hearts which is the love of this dunya and the hate of dying this hadith fits us as a glove and scholars tried to analyze the reasons behind our ummas coming at the end the deterioration of things why is this happening and some of them attributed it to economical reasons so they pointed out that if the economy where to rise and to become better that should solve all of all our problems so we found that people started adopting capitalism socialism trying different economical regimes so that they could solve this problem others said that no no no it is illiteracy that is causing this problem it is ignorance so we have to focus on technology we have to focus on science and others thought that the reason behind all of this is political reasons once we managed to fix politics and the leadership everything would be fine so they focused on democracy parties trying to acquire and get hold of authority in different countries all of these were focusing on the symptoms of an illness but not the illness itself and this is a very common mistake someone comes to you complains of a severe headache and pain in his stomach you give him a panadol or tylenol or aspirin pain relievers the pain goes he feels better two hours later he comes back and the pain is back you keep on giving him pain killers would this ever solve his problem never he probably has cancer he probably has something that is chronic you are only curing the symptoms but not the real illness so what is the real illness the real illness is that people have gone away from the only source of guidance and this is not my word and this is not my opinion this is the religion of allah azzawajal the people has gone astray and the consequences will appear as we see them today even worse allah says the almighty whoever follows my guidance will neither go astray in the world nor suffer in the hereafter and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed that is difficult life and we will gather that is raise him on the day of resurrection blind a depressed and difficult life for all those who turn away from allah's remembrance from allah's religion but if you follow his guidance you'll never go astray nor suffer in the hereafter this is allah's promise so the honor the dignity and the pride of this ummah relies on how close this ummah is to the quran"
