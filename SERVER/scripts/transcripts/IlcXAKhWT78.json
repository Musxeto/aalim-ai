  "title": "Punishment of Garment below ankle with or without pride",
  "transcript": "Abdullah from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I went on Islam Q&A and I was researching about Isbaal and I came to a conclusion based on looking at more than one article and I want to ask you is my opinion on it correct? Is that okay? Yeah, but make it quick because our time is up I'll make it quick, I'll make it quick So if someone goes out and he knows that the garment goes below his ankle, he is doing it out of pride And the scholars that are in Jema'ah, how do you say it, Ijma'ah, that it's only impermissible if someone does it out of pride Okay, what's the second thing? And the second thing is someone doing it blatantly out of pride, like mega, mega out of pride No, no, no, no, this is not true, this is wrong, your conclusion is wrong It's two things, either it goes beyond the ankle without any pride, but out of laziness Why is your garment going and sweeping the floor behind you? He said, I don't know, the tailor made it this way and I'm too lazy to fold it Then this is a major sin that would cause you to be tormented in hell from your ankle to your heels to the ground in hell This would be punished But if a person says because I'm from this family or that and I can't have my garment over the ankles, I would look like a peasant No, no, no, I can't, this is not my style, this is not my social standards So this guy is making it out of pride, he has four punishments Allah doesn't look at him, Allah does not purify him, Allah does not have mercy on him And he would be tormented in hell fire, the whole thing So this is the conclusion that you should have reached But someone who does it and he says I'm not doing it out of pride, but it happens No, he is sinful for that and he's making a major sin Allah knows best"
