  "transcript": "Finally, I bought my oldest child a gift when he started praying. Am I sinful for not getting the others a gift? And does each child gift have to be of equal price? So, the answer is yes. Giving a child a gift because they got good grades or because they started praying or as an achievement, as an award, is not permissible because this is a gift. And specifying that child with such a gift would favour him over the others. And this is what Islam prohibited. When giving a gift, they have to be all equal. And does the price must be the same in giving? The answer is yes. Gifts are different from what children need. So, a child needs a surgery, I don't have to pay the others the same cost of the hospital. A child is grown up and goes to college and needs a car, I buy the child a car in my name, not in his. And the one that goes to kindergarten does not say, I need something equivalent. No, because they are different. And likewise, and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
