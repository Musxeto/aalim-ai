  "title": "Do we have to pray 2 rakat Sunnah after Isha or does the Taraweeh suffice",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. So my question is after we pray Al-Isha with the Imam in the masjid, do we have to pray the two rakat sunnah before the Taraweeh or the Taraweeh covers for the two rakat sunnah after Al-Isha? Jazakum Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum. So the answer is your Taraweeh do not cover for the two rakat sunnah, ratibah, muakkadah after the Isha prayer. These are two different things and you cannot hit two birds with one stone because the sunnah of Isha is to be prayed and offered and this is separate from the Taraweeh. Combining it with Taraweeh would diminish and reduce your reward and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
