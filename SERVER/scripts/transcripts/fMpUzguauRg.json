  "title": "ðŸ†• ðŸ’« Are Muslim wives really not allowed to argue back with her husband? Assimalhakeem JAL ï¿¼",
  "transcript": "An anonymous person says, how is a wife supposed to reply back to her husband during arguments? Or is she supposed to talk in a respectful manner even when she's angry? First of all, marriage is not based on calculations, 1 plus 1 equals 2. It is a combination of feelings, emotions, circumstances, and traumas, and previous experiences, and future experiences, and the likes. Hence, it's not one size that fits all. And it would be illogical to ask a woman to be as submissive as a slave to her husband. Because, as we see, and I encounter this a lot in counseling sessions, men are not perfect, infallible individuals. They have their flaws, they have their shortcomings, so why would you expect your wife to be someone who's perfect when you're not? It doesn't make any sense. And besides arguments, fights, bickering, sometimes they're needed in a marriage as we need salt and pepper and spices. The moment respect is absent, then inevitably separation and divorce will take place sooner or later. We can't live with people that don't respect us. How the Prophet dealt with it? With respect and care and love. And Allah knows best."
