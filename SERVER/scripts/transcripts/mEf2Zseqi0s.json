  "transcript": "a sister sent us an email asking saying what is the definition of the youth the youth is an Arabic word which was mentioned in the hadith of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam a number of hadith which imam al albani may Allah have mercy on his soul authenticated and in Arabic originally it means to have a crooked tongue and it anything that is soft and easygoing is a stemmed from the word the youth or diantha or dasa etc and the hadith explain this the Prophet said Alice a lot o Sam 3 will not end paradise the one who is addicted to intoxicants a drunkard of wine who does not sober always drinking and a person who is abusive to his parents and thirdly at the youth and the Prophet are they thought some defined it by saying the one who approves something wrong with his family and throughout the scholars interpretation when studying these hadiths they came up with the conclusion that that the youth is the one who approves his women folk to fall into fornication or adultery and the means getting them close to that so a person who has no jealousy and is okay when his daughter goes out with her cousin his nephew and they go out for a couple of hours to watch her movie to a party and he thinks that she's like his sister he takes care of her not knowing what they're doing or knowing but looking the other way a person who allows men to mix with his wife not wearing the hijab and free mixing and having parties and and things that are not acceptable to any hot-blooded Muslim or he sees his daughter going out with her fiance who's not her husband yet and having an affair and is easy about this he says I am sophisticated I am moderate I'm civilized what's wrong with my daughter going out with a man he she is your daughter she's not a car giving her to a test drive said no no no this is all in your and medieval mind it's okay and she goes and she's being test driven like gazillion times and he's okay with that this is it the youth and this goes totally against manhood let alone against Islam and being proud of being the guarding and the protector of your women folk so this is the rough explanation now some people went a little bit further so they went an extra mile and said a person who has a television in his house where women can watch soap operas and movies is at the youth and this is not true this is not true this is not the level of D alpha which the Prophet assalam told us that would prevent person a person from entering gender it is sinful yes it is a breach of trust that Allah has bestowed upon you to take care of your family correct but it is not the diantha or that the youth is the one who sees this who sees his daughter's pictures in on Facebook or on Twitter almost nude who watches his daughter a friend of mine was telling me that his wife goes to the beach were with her father and she swims in a bikini and the father is looking at her what kind of a man is he definitely this falls under the category of the youth who has no shame and no jealousy in him may allah azzawajal protect us"
