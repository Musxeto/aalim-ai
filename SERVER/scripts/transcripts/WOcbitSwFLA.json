  "title": "Ruling on sending salutations to the Prophet ‎ﷺ or saying Ameen to an innovated Dua? Assim AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "what does the ruling on saying mean or saying while someone makes a dua that is innovated so for example someone is making a dua and he's making tawasu with the rasools is it permissible for me to say i mean to such a dua or to say sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he mentions the name of the rasool in such a torah okay i'll answer your question so it's quite clear if someone is making a dua that is innovative it is an innovation should i say i mean that says no you should not be in this that place from the beginning if he makes such an innovation you should have left but if the name of the prophet hassam was mentioned yes you offer the salutation due to the names mentioning not due to the innovation that is being practiced so yes we always say even if he is an innovator making a maoli but we offer salutation due to our love to our prophet but not due to his innovation but if someone in an innovation is saying oh prophet o prophet of allah i ask you to intercede and you say i mean you're participating you're endorsing and you're taking part in the same sin and allah knows best"
