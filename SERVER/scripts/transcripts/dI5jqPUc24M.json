  "title": "Difference between levels of Highest Jannah and Lowest Jannah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Bilal from UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, what is the difference in a person being in the highest Jannah and another person in the lowest Jannah in terms of rewards? I have not entered Jannah yet, so I do not know. I know that Allah Azza Wa Jal has encouraged us to seek the highest levels and the Prophet ï·º had also done the same by telling us that Jannah is levels and the best are the highest and the least in goodness is the lowest. So the more you go up, the more bounties and blessings and favours of Allah Azza Wa Jal that a person would attain. How to quantify this? I have no idea but I trust Allah Azza Wa Jal and I strive my level best to reach the highest level so that I would be highly satisfied instead of getting the middle or the lower level then regretting it on the Day of Judgment."
