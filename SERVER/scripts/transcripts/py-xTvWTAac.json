  "transcript": "Ayman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. How can I help you Ayman? So my question is sometimes when I'm making wudu and I'm washing my face, washing my nose specifically, I do it once but when I the water doesn't go all the way up my nostrils because this like it burns my nose. So I was wondering if this is like if this is okay, if I could just like wash it halfway up to the nostrils. JazakAllah Khair. The answer is yes. You have to rinse your nose. The best is to pull it to the best of your ability up your nostrils and if this is not valid then just inserting a little bit of it in your nose does the job bi-idhnillah especially when you have a case like you do this burning sensation."
