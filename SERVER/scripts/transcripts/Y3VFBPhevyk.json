  "transcript": "uh nishad from saudi sheikh i wanted to ask this question about being cautious uh regarding hijab uh suppose i am visiting a friend's place and her husband is in her house but he's inside uh the bedroom and we are sitting in this secluded area for the females only is it okay to take off my apaya in hijab being modestly dressed or is it mandatory to cover myself just thinking that maybe he will come or maybe something will happen or is it just okay to do my part and relax is that okay okay nishat from saudi arabia she says that is it okay if i visit my girlfriend who's married her husband is in another chamber or another room locked and we have our ladies only quarters and i take my hijab and i feel free there's no problem in that as long as there is no fear of him barging in which most people don't do in normal houses no man would do that even with the lightest doubt that there are none with his wife he would never do that so as long as it's safe there's no problem in taking it off"
