  "title": "Do you have to pay Mahr if the marriage was NOT consummated in divorce case & what about her Iddah?",
  "transcript": "from sanaa and she says do you have to pay mahar if the marriage was not consummated in a divorce case well this is an issue of dispute in islam or in the quran we are told that if a man consummates the marriage he must not take a penny from her dowry and it's fully hers so this is understood also in the quran it says that if you were to divorce a woman without consummating the marriage then she has no id there's no waiting period in another verse that she deserves half of the dowry not the full thing and this is what made the scholars differ among them without going into details the vast majority of scholars say that if a woman was divorced before the marriage was consummated before being alone or in contact with the husband then there is no edda there's no waiting period and he cannot reconcile with her and half of the dowry has to be allocated and given to her this is what they say what about if the marriage was not consummated but they were both alone in a locked room well this is a different issue the vast majority of scholars say that there is upon the woman if divorced and the dowry is fully hers the man objects hey wait wait i didn't consummate the marriage i didn't have intercourse with her we say yes but understanding of almost if not all of the companions who understand the quran and the sunnah better than us it's almost consensus of the companions reported by omar by ali by great number of companions that whenever the room is locked the drapes are down the curtains are down and nobody is allowed in the chamber other than the man and his wife and they're alone then the marriage is consummated even if he did not touch her because i don't know what's happening inside so for the benefit of the doubt this is considered to be marriage consummation and she's entitled for the whole maha and allah knows best you"
