  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bosnia Sheikh I'm coming back at you with a sports \nrelated question if that's okay - yes sir   so basically not too long ago I stopped my career \nin basketball I used to practice a lot and had a   good amount of team practices however after this \nyears Ramadan I felt a change in my heart about   the things that I do on a daily basis it bothered \nme for example that my teammates sometimes wore   and mostly wore shorts that expose the awrah you \nknow but now I still feel a great passion for the   sport and I still wish to pursue basketball and \nwant to and I want to use it to see how I can   attain possible future benefits and education \nand so on and so forth so what is your advice   in this and what is the rules you know ruling on \nthis Jazak Allahu Khairan - Wa Jazakum - Playing   sports as we've stated many times before is \na good thing to be healthy and to play sports   and to utilize your time in something you find \nyour passion and heart in as long as there is   nothing haram this is totally permissible so \nyou're saying that your friends wear shorts   to my knowledge the vast majority of basketball \nplayers if not all their shorts go to their knees   and almost covering them but even if the knees \nare exposed this is not awrah the awrah is what   is above the knees so the vast majority if not all \ncover their awrah so there's no problem in their   clothes to my knowledge now if they're playing \nwith really shorts short shorts that expose   their thighs then you should not be involved \nwith them you should not play with them now   pursuing basketball as a career is it something \nbefitting a practicing Muslim the answer is no   why first of all it involves a lot of haram if \nnot the least would be one of the haram things   the music they have involved during the playing \ntime or during the breaks the cheerleaders that   come and dance in inappropriate clothings \nall day long the practicing time that may   go against your Salat may go against Ramadan \nmay involve things that are inappropriate   hitting the showers if they don't have private \nshowers and everybody's taking shower together   and you know what happens over there from exposing \nawrah and etc among other things so if you can   guarantee to avoid all of these things I see no \nproblem in pursuing it as a career but if not   then yes you can play it you can enjoy playing \nit but not as a profession and Allah knows best"
