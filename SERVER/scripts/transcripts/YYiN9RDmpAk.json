  "title": "Not speaking to a Muslim for more than 3 days, do we have to be BEST Buddies though? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh muzina from India my question is can I refrain from talking to a Muslim who is not a blood relative of mine but always tries to pass derogatory remarks at me which causes fitna um see again a lot of the people think that or misunderstand Hadith where the Prophet says it is not permissible for two Muslim people to boycott one another more than three days they meet and each one gives his back to the other and depart their ways and part their ways this Hadith is related to normal Muslims me and a brother we had a conflict we had an argument it was heated and we disagreed and left I may see this brother tomorrow the day after or the day after that and not give him Salaam and he may do the same ignoring me totally for three days after these three days this is a concession in Islam you're allowed to vent in these three days to to cool down and to maybe reflect on your relationship with that person but after three days are over if we were to meet it is totally prohibited to give one's back to each other and we have to exchange the minimal requirement which is and we may depart we may not exchange anything else the salaam is the minimal requirement accepted now this is in case of us meeting one another if it so happens that he lives in on the other side of town and I don't see him or meet him at work or at Uni or anywhere else and we don't see one another for a whole year are we sinful of course not I am not obliged to call him so if you don't like a particular sister who's not a blood relative who's just a colleague a friend a neighbor and it feels that she's pulling you down and she is managing to bring the worst in you whenever you meet so in order to preserve your Iman you say to yourself she's bad news I'm not going to call her I don't want to get anything to do with her and you don't and she doesn't call you and you guys never meet in a mall or in a wedding or at a gathering even if you don't see one another for 10 years or speak with one another for 10 years there's no sin on you the sin is when you guys meet and you pretend that you did not see her or when she calls and says salaam alaikum and you don't reply for her salaam this is where the sin is and Allah Knows Best"
