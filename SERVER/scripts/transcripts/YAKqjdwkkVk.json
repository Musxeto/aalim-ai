  "transcript": "Ayan from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So Sheikh my question is that as you know in the last silent rakahs of the congregation we have to recite Suratul Fatiha. So what if we haven't completed the Surah Fatiha and the Imam goes or if we make a mistake in the Surah Fatiha in the silent rakah? It is without doubt among the vast majority of scholars, the vast majority of scholars say that reciting the Fatiha in silent rakah is a pillar upon the Imam, the individual, and the follower. All those who pray, they must recite the Fatiha in silent rakahs. So if you miss reciting the Fatiha, either due to the Imam is too fast or you are too slow, then this rakah is invalid. What to do? After the Imam offers salam, you have to stand up and make up for this missed rakah. Now if you are too slow, you have to work on speeding your recitation. So when you're not praying, just sit, repeat the Fatiha a thousand No Imam can be faster than me, and I will still have time to recite another surah. This comes with practice. So recite it 1,000 times, 5,000 times, until you master saying it without a mistake. Then you will find that your prayer is valid. But if the Imam is way too fast, and everyone in the congregation is unable to catch up with the Imam, because it's too fast, everybody acknowledges this, kick him in the backside and let him stick into the front wall, tell him don't pray as an Imam. Either fear Allah and learn how to pray, recite slowly and add another surah just so that those behind you would be able to catch up, or don't pray, don't lead. We don't want you. As simple as that, and Allah knows best."
