  "transcript": "what kind of sleep invalidates our wudu if we're sitting or reclining on the couch and our eyes close for a few minutes does this nullify wudu the hadith that governs this issue is the prophet said the eyes are the rope that ties the anus like a rope that ties a water bag once the rope is untied what's in it will spill so if a person sleeps then he would have no control over his feelings and most likely wind would pass number one number two the hadith where the prophet islam used to come late for asia prayer and the companions are waiting in the masjid and as anas says and there would they would doze and their chins would reach their chests because of their dosing and when the prophet came they all stood up for prayer so combining these two hadiths scholars came up with a conclusion that if you're sitting firmly on the ground and you doze for few seconds maybe a minute or so but you're aware sometimes you those but you can hear what's happening around you and if somebody tries to snatch something from your pocket you're aware so this type of doziness if the noun is correct if not sue me um is okay in the sense that he doesn't break a wudu but if someone is lying on his side and he dozes for five minutes and then he's aware no go ahead and make wudu the least that could have come out was uh wind maybe earth and fire uh followed that so um hopefully uh uh this answers your question you"
