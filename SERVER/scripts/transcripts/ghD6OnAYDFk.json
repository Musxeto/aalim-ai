  "transcript": "ishraq from singapore he says that the imam usually when he goes to rokur he says allahu akbar after he is in the record position which is wrong some people say allahu akbar and then they go for this is wrong some say after reaching the raku allahu akbar and this is wrong it should be in between so the moment he starts to move he says so sometimes he's doubtful whether he was with the imam in record position or not whenever you're doubtful either you can't take a decision so you're totally blinded yes or no i don't know or you are inclined that you have been in record with him either way you have to do according to what is your gut gut feeling so if you feel that yes i was a more inclined not 100 percent i'm more inclined that i was with him you have to prostrate to twice for forgetfulness after salam but if you are not at all certain you should assume that you've missed the rakah and after salaam you stand up and pray an additional raqqa and offer you the sahu for that allah"
