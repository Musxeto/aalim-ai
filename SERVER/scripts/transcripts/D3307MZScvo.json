  "title": "What are the Conditions of Hajj, is my husband sinful if he does not go due to medical reasons?",
  "transcript": "AR from the UK alayum um we applied for H but all the packages on musk were sold out immediately so recently we received an email about more available packages however the packages offered um do not meet our needs in terms of cost and duration um my husband um is the soul bread Winer and meam Ian of the females in our family we don't have any relatives nearby therefore if the whole family goes it will be very costly for us although he can afford to go on his own he's current currently dealing with some health issues that are being diagnosed and he is unsure if he can get time of work on short notice so given this situation will he be sinful if he doesn't accept the H offer the answer is no he would not be sinful if all the reasons you've listed are genuine and true Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear and alhamdulillah Allah mandated Haj upon those who are physically and uh financially capable of performing it so if your husband can only pay for his own package this is half of the problem the other half is if he's phys physically and medically not fit or he feels and this is genuine and real that his condition May deteriorate and he may need medical attention or there would be great hardship to go in his own unattended by members of his family in this case alhamdulillah he can wait until the following year until he gains more money and get a better uh package earlier on and at the same time his condition would inshallah improve and Allah Knows Best"
