  "title": "Best Way to Advise People or give Dawah for different types of people indirectly, forbid evil right",
  "transcript": "page uh page 260 chapter the person who is patient when people injure him said the prophet salallahu said the believer who mixes with people and puts up with their abuse is better than the person who does not mix with the people and does not put up with their abuse authentic so the prophet alaihis salatu is telling us that there are two types of people type one who mixes with others interacts with them answers and accepts their invitations invite them to their or to his events yet through the process he is tolerant because when you mix with people inevitably you have to get harm this is a well-known fact if you befriend someone you will benefit but you will get some harm if you mix with a group of muslims you will see things that may not be appropriate you may have to bring it to their attention they may attack you accordingly because when people are advised they are a little bit more or less defensive they don't accept you would not accept if i say why are you doing this immediately you become defensive but if i speak about the same sin on someone else although you're doing it you say subhanallah i don't know how people behave like this because it's not you it's someone else and this is why the best form of advice is the advice that comes indirectly the prophet when he used to see something wrong he used to come to the pulpit and say alhamdulillah why do so and so people behave in such a fashion and he does not address that individual this this is the best way of doing it so that you can break the ice and make people accept your advice so this is type one type two are those who do not want headache so they say listen i if i mix with people they cause problems we fight they don't like me they uh uh back bite me and i bite them tell you what i will stay home i will not go out i will not answer any invitation and this way i will be safe now this is your right you can do this no one is forcing you to come out but what is more rewarding to allah azzawajal if you stay back home and pray or if you mix with people and advise them and teach them and tolerate their abuse definitely the latter so in this hadith the prophet is highlighting that you have to be active have to be tolerant have to be patient because life is not easy so this is an encouragement for you to mix with others to tolerate to be patient however there are other hadiths that go against this this is in the times of tribulation and fitten the prophet tells us that there will come a time when the best of you would be a man with few of his sheep at the top of a mountain eating and drinking from these sheep and worshipping allah staying away from people so how can we understand this we can understand that it depends on what the pros and cons someone says i have a rage problem if i open my mouth 10 seconds later i'm end up beating the man anyone who says anything i cannot tolerate i know people like this i know practicing brothers every other week he's coming with a black eye or what is this well i met someone i told him he said it's not of your business i spanked him and we had a fight and we ended up in the police station i don't i will not tell you shave your beard because this is a sin but what you're doing is more sinful you're giving us a bad reputation he said what can i do i cannot tolerate this some people when they say evil when they see evil they forbid it which is good kuntum this is excellent but if it's going to cause a bigger problem don't do it allah says do not curse the idols if it would lead for the idol worshipers to curse allah cursing the idols is good they are false they're nothing but stones but if this would lead them to curse allah which is bad then refrain don't do it so measuring the consequences is an extremely important aspect in islam therefore this hadith is general individuals who fail to comply we would say stay away if you open your mouth you cause devastation shut up sit back relax extend your feet watch uh television or the news don't go out but generally speaking no you have to train yourself life is not paved with flowers and roses there is hardship if i come and tell my wife to do something islamically she says look at yourself do this and that first this happens you come to a brother or a friend you're doing this sin this is not permissible allah says so-and-so so i'm just giving you advice in the cause of allah israel cut your nails first oh sorry i didn't know that my nails were long but what does this have to do with that touche you saw my mistakes i saw your mistakes what kind of muslims are you once you get the advice say take it accept it implement it why must it be personal if you see my mistakes i see your mistakes okay assume i did not see your mistakes or brought it to your attention then i will hush hash subhan allah then your intention was not for the sake of allah when you corrected me it was just to get even and this shows you how bad muslims can be when they do not do what they do for the sake of allah [Music]"
