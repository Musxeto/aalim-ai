  "transcript": "uh obey your parents e if they command you to abandon your worldly possessions then leave it for their sake this is the essence that you should obey your parents this is why we brought this hadith here and this sentence is correct there is a hadith where the prophet says to a companion you and your wealth belong to your father you know this hadith yes every father knows this hadith by heart the children yeah is it is it authentic i've heard it but i'm not sure it is authentic yet the understanding of it differs i know a brother whose son is a multi-millionaire and he keeps on asking his son to take to give him a trip around the world to buy him a new villa to buy a new furniture new tvs and buy cars and and the son comes to me and complains and the justification of that father is that my son and his wealth at the prophet saws belongs to me his understanding is wrong why because the consensus of all scholars if the son dies who or what does the father inherit if the understanding is as the father understands it the father should inherit everything and nothing goes through the wife nothing goes to the son nothing goes to the the daughter nothing goes to the mother but this is not the case if he has a son the father gets only one sixth and his grandson gets the rest you know the inheritance thing this is not the time but the concept is if you understand the relationship then you go back to understanding you and your wealth wealth belong to your father what does it mean then it means that you should not deprive you should not prevent your father from what he needs you must give to your father what he needs if you have access so a multi-millionaire like myself why are they laughing okay madish i forgive you a multi-millionaire like myself my father comes and says i want a hundred thousand uh ringgits to change the furniture of the house okay i look into my father's wealth and i find that my father has in his bank account 100 million excuse me why do you want to take from me if i have access and it would not affect me it is a must for me to give him because even if they ask you to come out of your worldly possessions do it but there are restrictions if i am a nine to five worker an employee i have my salary i have my wife my children my uh flat i live in and i want to improve my life i don't have my own property and he wants to take a portion of what i possess that would affect my wife livelihood or my children's livelihood in this case i do not give him except what he needs if his stone broke i have to provide from him food shelter but if he has money and he asks me of something that harms me i am not entitled to give him it's not my obligation i give you another example i'm rich i have money and he has money but not that rich and he says i need 10 000 ringgits i said with all pleasure my father why do you need it for he said i want to give your brother the money so that he could go for vacation no now you're not being fair to me you want to use you my money for my sibling no for you i give you whatever you wish for your livelihood but when you come and cross the line to take my money for my siblings islam tells you you're not your obligation of course if you have a lot of money like me it's okay it's best to give it to him and allah would quadruple it for you up to 700 times allah will return it to you you did not work hard for the money did you allah gave it to you there are so many people who work ten times more than you and cannot get one tenth of what you have so the provider is allah azza so don't hold back whenever allah tells you give you give and then allah would substitute you for that"
