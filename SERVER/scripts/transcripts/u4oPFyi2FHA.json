  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I wanted to ask what's the difference between the one who leaves the Salah on purpose out of ignorance, out of Jakabur and the one who does it out of laziness according to scholars. Jazakum Allah khair. Wa Jazakum. This is a very very long topic and a difference of opinion among scholars. MashaAllah, he took the opinion that the one who leaves Salat is not a Kafir. And I supported the opinion that the one who leaves Salat is a Kafir. whoever abandons Salat permanently, whether out of laziness or deliberately, is a Kafir providing, this is theoretical, theoretically. This is what the Prophet said, this is what is mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah. Allah Azzawajal says, If they were to repent and establish Salat, they are your brethren. And Allah Azzawajal says, What admitted you to hellfire? The believers ask those dwelling in hell, why are you in hell? They said, we were not among those who used to pray. And the Prophet said, The pledge between us and them is Salat. Whoever abandons it is a Kafir. He committed Kufr. And he said, Between man and Shirk and Kufr, abandoning Salat. And a number of Hadiths. However, this is what? Theoretical. Meaning this is theoretical. Now to apply it. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Because lots of us read this and say, okay, the brother doesn't pray with us in the office. He's a Kafir. I have gazillion of people coming to me in counseling sessions. Shaykh, my father doesn't pray. We told him so many times he doesn't pray. So can I give him Salam? So many people are so eager to give Takfir to their own parents. Wallahi. Not one or two or ten or twenty. Because these youngsters take little of knowledge and they think by implementing it. They're doing the right thing. Unfortunately, Satan is utilizing them because they feel they have the power to label people. You're a Kafir, you're a Mushrik, you're this, you're that. And this is where nicest comes. This is where the Khawarij comes. With little knowledge and a lot of enthusiasm that derails them from the straight path. No, this is not the right way. Practical, you cannot label anyone with Kufr until there are conditions fulfilled and obstacles avoided. And this is not for any Tom, Dick or Harry. This is only for scholars of Islam who know what they're doing and what they are talking about. Therefore, coming back to your question. A person who leaves Salat out of laziness and dies. What I say to the people, congregation, don't pray Janazah. He's a Kafir? Yes or no? Why? Because he was not labeled as a Kafir when he was alive. He was not held at gunpoint. Either you pray or we're going to blow your head off. No, he was negligent. Maybe he prayed at the end of the night. Maybe he prayed when you went to the Masjid. He prayed on his own. When you went to the Masjid, he prayed in the office. We don't know. So he was not labeled. And this is the practical aspect of it. Theoretically, yes, whoever abandons prayer is a Kafir. But to implement it, we have a whole list of checklists that must be followed. And Allah knows best."
