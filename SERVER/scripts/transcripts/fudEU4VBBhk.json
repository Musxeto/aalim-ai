  "transcript": "so what's the best advice give next year is too late I I don't seriously w w I don't know why people delay their marriage it's something good it's something beneficial and the need to protect yourself from FNA is ongoing waiting till next year is almost 5 months why wait at least do the did you do the okay now you did the and you see something next door No don't touch why don't touch me why this is my Halal wife no her father says don't touch her doesn't make any sense so you're making Temptation on things go and get married oh because we have relatives coming and hiring the whole marriage is a simple thing in Islam whenever the need is strong Allah makes things easy the need for air is strong how much do you pay for it huh nothing it's everywhere the need for water is great but less than the need for air so you have to dig you have to go and fetch water you have to ask and they give you inshah Subhan Allah likewise marriage the need for marriage is easy you go to the father say um the father looks at you checks around I give you my daughter in marriage you say I accept two witnesses are there take your wife no wedding no uh uh Hotel receptions no thousands of dollars spent on illogical things death also is part of our Lives my relative died I died what to do oh put him in a Cascade let people visit him for one week uh air condition the area do this no no no no no in Saudi a person dies he's buried 2 hours what is this rocket science we get the paperwork bah get the guy wash him with clean him shroud him put perfume on him y take him in ambulance to the Masid prayer we pray take him to the graveyard ditch him and bury him business as usual because we don't have musical groups you know and bands and and playing marches and this and putting him no nothing easy we don't even have reception at the home afterwards you come see me in the mid move on 3 days and it's over we don't put shares and put lights and we hire people to give the guests coffee and tea what is this might as well give them take away sh this is morning they're coming to give their respect they come to your home you don't open a gallery for them and and this so the things when they are easy in Islam and and and need it Allah makes it easy what is my advice for someone who's getting married to fear Allah to know obligations and responsibilities that he has to deliver to his wife not to know his rights because if you ask anyone who's getting married what are your rights he gives you a long list she has to give me massage when I before I go to bed she has to massage my feet she has to bring me some hot water and salt to put my feet in she has to know how to cook my favorite food she has to iron my clothes she has to keep the house clean she has to know where to put my shoes when I leave and when I come she has whoa get a slave go maybe to morania they say they sell slaves it's easier cheaper no learn your obligations and responsibilities as a man how to protect your wife how to respect her how to be her Rock how to provide for her how to ignore and neglect her shortcomings and flaws because she's a human being bound to do these things once you learn then you start to develop and practice and this requires a lot of work from your side on my YouTube I think last year I did a seminar and a workshop on rights of husbands and wives and a lot of stuff about this it will help you but always consider you have sisters how do you want their husbands to treat them tomorrow you will have da daughters how would you like your sons-in-law to treat your daughters it's the same way you treat your wife treat her with respect treat her with love treat her with compassion Allah will send your way sons-in-laws and brothers-in-law who will treat your female relatives in the same fashion Allah knows us"
