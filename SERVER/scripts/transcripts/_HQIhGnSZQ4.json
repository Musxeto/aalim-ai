  "transcript": "Abdurrahman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum My question is in rainy season sometimes roadside mud splashes on my dress and even if I clean it some stains remains. So, if I pray with this cloth will my prayer is valid? I can't change the cloth because I'm on the way of work. So, what should I do Sheikh? Is it Najis or you don't know? I don't know Sheikh. It might be Najis because roadside mud while we are travelling due to the other vehicles it splashes on my dress. The default Akhi is that everything on this earth is pure until proven. Proven is written with lock caps, bold font, red underlined, quote unquote. If you have proof that it is Najis then you have to wash it. But if you don't have proof you may be I think perhaps ignore it and move on. It is by default pure."
