  "transcript": "Abu Saeed from Bangladesh Sheikh, I ordered a product online and while paying the delivery man, another guy asked the delivery man about his order. Then I left the place before the delivery man counted the money because there were some coins along with notes in it. Now I am wondering day and night whether I have violated someone's right because I have not officially left the place but I gave the full money and I am thinking that I have used a few coins which the delivery man may have not liked. What points are you talking about? The product is 50,000 taka, you gave the man 50,000 taka. What's left? I gave the full payment but used some coins so I didn't leave officially because he was talking with another guy. What points Akhi, I don't understand, are you playing a video game? No Sheikh, actually I paid with notes and coins. Actually I used cash, paper notes and coins. Yes, I combined both of these and I think that the delivery man may have not liked to take the coins because everyone uses notes and they generally don't likeâ€¦ No problem, it's not his preference. As long as you paid him money, whether it's coins or in bank notes, the payment was paid in full, you have no worries whether he likes it or not and the payment is good and the product is good inshallah."
