  "transcript": "is from Pakistan Alum I was saying that we know that before we enter our parents room we have to ask permission but uh when I found out about this ruing then I tried it uh my parents they really got very angry and they start calling me names and we had so many arguments and I have to also enter the room many times because you know my toothbrush is there every a lot of times my parents come to sit down my other sibling comes in without asking permission so they expect me to come in as well but if I don't do it they start again start something so my uh question is is it permissible in this case to enter without permission is the door open or closed it's open if it's open you don't need permission the permission is for closed doors the permission is for closed doors this is when you knock because behind closed doors people can be nak it could be engaging in uh actions that they don't want others to see but when they door is open this is an open invitation for you to come whenever you want there's no need to seek permission"
