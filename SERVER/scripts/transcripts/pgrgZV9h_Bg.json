  "transcript": "says he's got an uncle and he's 14 years of age and he treats him bad spies on him first of all this is a dispute zenedine i heard your side of the story i didn't hear yours your uncle's side of the story and it seems that all of your mother's family agree with him which means that most likely you are either impolite or doing something wrong that needs spying or had done something in the past that was extremely bad and they are scared and wanting to ensure that does not happen again i need to hear his side of the story maybe he will tell to sell me sheikh you don't know my nephew used to contact nicest and used to send them emails and i'm afraid that he will be recruited by them and then this would put us in trouble islamically and with the authorities so i'm doing this for that reason um okay this is a different story maybe he would say that he crossed the line so many times by speaking ill about the elders and saying bad things cursing them giving them to fear maybe telling them that you're innovators you're ignorant in islam i don't know so this dispute cannot be solved by just hearing your side of the story and i'm sorry for that"
