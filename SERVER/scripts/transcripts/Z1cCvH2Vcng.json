  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh. So sheikh actually my question is every Friday \nduring the Imam's ceremony in our Masjid I always   try to sit in the first row alhamdulillah but \nsince the Imam is standing right in front of me   it is difficult for me to keep \nmy eyes on him, in this case,   if I keep my eyes on the mimbar will \nthe Sunnah be fulfilled or not Sheikh? Jazak Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazaakum, there is no problem in \nnot looking at your Imam simply because   it is up to your preference. If it is difficult - If the imam is in front \nof you there is no problem. If the imam is   to your right to do this for half \nan hour would break your neck. The logical thing is to shift your \nwhole body instead of facing the Qibla   you face the Imam himself and there's \nno problem in that none one whatsoever. If this is not possible or inconvenient there \nis no problem in looking wherever you want   and not on the mimbar. Anywhere you wish and Allah knows best."
