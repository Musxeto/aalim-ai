  "title": "How to Handle Abusive People?  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "do I do when the people are abusive dealing with me totally ignoring them so they speak they cursed you they point fingers at you they accuse you of things to give them a smile do not say anything not even I didn't do that no oh yes you true nothing just smile when they want to engage in an argument don't accept maybe sometimes you say you might be right and that's it so you keep on talking you keep on talking while you're giving them a smile and not paying attention to what they say and that's allowing it to penetrate your heart which is difficult but with time you get to learn it is shallow after a few times of such an argument they start to feel silly they start to feel irritated because they're not getting any response so you're turning the table on them by not responding to them you are killing them softly but if you do respond then they become stronger it's like oxygen to them they get a good sense of breeze breeze and a breath of fresh air which you don't want because oxygen fuels fire eliminate oxygen the fire dies so may Allah make it easy for you remain steadfast"
