  "transcript": "unfortunately even among the good people you \nmay find someone who's been acting weird lately   nowadays I hear alhamdulillah don't waste my \ntime watching this Trend among some of guys   but I hear people coming to me and saying \nDaee so and so he does very good work he   fights uh liberals he fights uh deviant sects he \nfights Christians and blah blah blah feminists   and the Daee is talking about aqeedah and \nhe defends this and he defends that and the   third one is doing this good work as the old ad \nsays big pot of bread oh big big pot of bread   big pot of bread but where's the beef what are \nthese dad is calling for every week or every   month there is a podcast This daee did this and he \ndid that he's an innovator he's a deviant he's a   hypocrite he's a lier and they start fighting one \nanother and a rebuttal and a debate and everyone   throws stones at the other one and the Muslims are \nyou know like watching a ping pong match they're   just going doing this doing that and they don't \nknow what's cooking the only one who's having fun   is Shaytan excellent excellent very good okay \nkeep up the good work is this what Islam about   is all of your years of studying and \nworking hard ended up in making daw'a   to undermine other people's works who cares \nwho cares about you or about them teach me   something that's good for my religion teach me \nsomething that gets me closer to Allah so this   is one part of the extremists those who are like \nflies only falling on dirt only falling on crap   and feeding on it may Allah protect us the other \nextreme are those who have diluted religion   so yeah well come on board \neverything goes let's go   where anywhere you want what is \nIslam anything you can believe in   so these guys they say Yup! there is no problem \nin collaborating and cooperating with the Khawarij   with the Liberals with the Mo'tazila with \nthe Shi'aa with the super sufis with the   grave worshipers with even atheists \nas long as we can benefit from them   politicians who've committed real Kufr   but they say they're Muslims get them on board \nwow what is this this is not part of Islam   definitely these are the two extremes okay who's \nthe middle part the middle path are those blessed   by Allah azzawajal to follow the footsteps of the \nProphet (Peace and Blessing be Upon Him) neither   one of the two sects by the way could ever \nclaim that I follow the Prophet (Peace and   Blessing be Upon Him) methodology I follow the \nProphet (Peace and Blessing be Upon Him) Manhajj I think one of my tooth is cracking no its fine \nAlhamdulillah who cares Taiwanese spare parts so the thing is the way of the Prophet (Peace and \nBlessing be Upon Him) is what joins us is what   unites us so if someone were to go against the way \nof the Prophet (Peace and Blessing be Upon Him) we   don't jump the gun we don't shoot and then \nask questions no we analyze if his mistake was   probable acceptable due to misunderstanding \nsome sort of ambiguity that made him   do something thinking that it was \nwas the right thing we accept him   but we correct him at the same time and we \ndo this that is accepting him and correcting   him with a heart filled with compassion and \nlove but if that particular individual went   against the Prophet (Peace and Blessing be Upon \nHim) simply because he's a deviant innovator   he's keen on spreading evil and vice that supports \nhis falsehood and his dawah in this case no we   have to make a stance we have to show him his \nmistake while still being feeling sorry for him   not that we uh Another One Bites the Dust We just \nwant to smack him in the face and you know keep on   kicking him while he's on the ground until he \ndies no no no despite his sins and innovation   our Islamic stance is to do inkaar to to \nrectify his mistakes and correct his flaws   and shortcomings while still feeling sorry \nfor him this is why the enemies of Allah   have failed to conquer the Muslim ummah physically \non the military front they could never beat us   but they found out a an easier and a cheaper \nway to try to divide us because this is   that would be the main source and \ncause of our defeat divide and conquer   therefore there is no victory for the Muslims \nthere is no pride and honor for the Muslims   unless they reunite and unless they show their \nsolidarity and get back to abide by the Sunnah   and before that by the Quran and to abide by \nloving goodness for others wanting good for them   not to prevail not to score a point against you \nnot to gain as many followers by these podcasts   wanting to be famous wanting to be well known \nthis is not the way of unity therefore whenever   we disagree over something whenever we dispute \nand have a difference of opinion we must not   have Discord or disunity or division \nwe must always remember we are one   ummah We Are One Nation Under the flag of the \nProphet Allah and we have to be knowledgeable   when we advise people we have to be \nperseverant and wise and we have to look   for the best of the two choices the pros and \ncons and take the prose and what overweighs   and always always always be careful not to reserve \na chunk for your own self because a lot of us   fail in doing this a lot of us \nwhatever we do whatever we say   where's the credit what is it for me what \ndid you where is my name in the beginning   or at the end okay what is this no Akhi do what \nyou do for the sake of Allah it doesn't matter   if you're at the beginning of a first row or at \nthe end as the Hadith of the Prophet (Peace and   Blessing be Upon Him) indicated and our reference \nin the beginning and at the end is always the book   of Allah and the Hadith of the Proophet (Peace and \nBlessing be Upon Him) Allah says and if you differ   in anything amongst yourselves refer it to Allah \nand his messenger if you believe in Allah and in   the last day or Unity is not based on the Arabs \nsupporting the Arabs the pakistanis supporting the   Pakistani even if he's wrong even if his deviant \nif he is calling for bad things we're backing him   up the uh Moroccans the Egyptians the Indians \nthe Americans the rivers each supporting his   folks this is not this Islam this is the division \nthat we were warned not to be involved in"
