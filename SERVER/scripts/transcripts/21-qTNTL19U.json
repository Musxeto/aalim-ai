  "transcript": "Shifan from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh My brother has a motorcycle washing shop and where he gives some gifts to a lottery to encourage some of his customers during the month Ramadan because it is not possible to give gifts to everyone due to his budget that's why he organized this lottery there is no extra charge in this lottery coupons are give to them only when they wash their motorcycles so is it permissible it's an issue of dispute personally i think as long as the price of washing the motorcycle is the same so whether there's a lottery or not the price is fixed and they're getting this as a bonus as a gift there's no problem in it inshallah"
