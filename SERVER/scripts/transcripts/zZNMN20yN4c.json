  "transcript": "is it allowed for a muslim woman to wear a bindi which is a dot placed in the middle of the forehead as a way to beautify herself please note that the hindus use a red bindi for religious reasons but in my country most women wear them for beautification this is totally prohibited this is part of the hindu religious traditions no muslim with dignity and honor would imitate them in what they're doing even if it is for the sake of beautification why put it here put it on your nose maybe you become more beautiful put two spots here like dolls maybe you will become more beautiful it is prohibited for a muslim to follow what the hindus do in such a fashion we have our religion we have our honor we have our dignity we go and what else maybe tomorrow you want to wear a saree exposing your uh chest and and stomach what else would you maybe like to dance in front of men this is all prohibited sharia has precedence the law of allah overrules everything else so you don't use your logic or reason or intellect when allah azzawajal orders you to follow his commands when the prophet salallahu tells you that whoever imitates a people is one of them by imitating them you risk the danger of being with them on the day of judgment would you want to be with the hindus a man came to the prophet sallallahu i made a vow that i would slaughter a camel in a village by the name of buwana which was near medina so the prophet asked him two questions isosceles is there an idol worshiped for the idol worshipers the man said no which means that if he said yes the prophet would say no it's prohibited because people would see you slaughter a camel and they would think that this is for their idol not for allah though your intention is 100 pure but just to avoid people thinking that it becomes prohibited the bindi is prohibited for the same reason the second question the prophet said allah is there any festival for the disbelievers there because if they see you slaughter a camel they would think that you're doing it for their festival and you're celebrating with them the man said no so the prophet said to him fulfill your vow go ahead and slaughter your camel over there as you have vowed and pledged there's no problem in that and alano's best"
