  "transcript": "but if I is from Saudi Arabia's second question is it permissible to make dua to Allah to uplift this calamity this coffee'd 19 virus in these illnesses away from Muslims and non-muslims alike that says yes we are entitled to make dua to non-muslims who are not enemies of Islam so if I have a neighbor if I know someone who is not attacking Islam and the Muslims which is the vast majority of non-muslims I can ask Allah and pray to Allah to give them long life to give them good health to bless their life health wealth what I'm not permitted to do in my religion is to ask Allah to have mercy upon them because they are non-muslims they're disbelievers and in Islam we've told that because of their disbelief in Allah because of their qu for that we should not ask Allah to forgive them or to have mercy for them or to admit them to paradise but other than that in this worldly life yes may Allah bless your wealth and health and your offspring and grant you a nice life on earth there's nothing in wrong in that so yes you can say oh Allah relieve all Muslims and non-muslims from this covered 19 and from the tribulations that it brings with it there's no problem in that insha'Allah"
