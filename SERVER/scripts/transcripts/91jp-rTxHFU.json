  "title": "Identifying as having OCD, Washing my bottom jaw of Face & it dries!!! assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Musa from Azerbaijan Salam Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam to Allah Sheikh I'm having OCD in Wudu and it takes much time to wash my face Especially the bottom corner of jaws I mean not chin part, but the other corner It's at the same time the like the bottom corner of the face Is Wudu invalid if dry place left there though trying much? It cannot dry if you tried Akhi Yani, this is illogical My forehead is dry. So I wash it again and the bottom is dry. So what is this? Are you? Living in a microwave it cannot be Washing the face is the easiest thing to be done and I told you this many times But you seem to be Fixated on making your life difficult. I cannot help you if someone with OCD Insists that no, I want to make my life difficult I'm not happy with the way that the Prophet used to make Wudu. Alayhis Salaam, he used to make Wudu with almost the same size of water in this So you're not following the Prophet Alayhis Salaam. Who knows better you or him? Of course him who is more righteous and pious you or him? Of course him So if you're not following his footsteps, what is a problem? I have OCD So all those around you go to bed and sleep comfortably and don't think about anything They don't even care about you. You're the only one who's being tortured and tormented Because it's self-inflicted wounds. This is doing this for yourself. You're the one who's doing it. It's your responsibility What is it washing the face put a Tablespoon one tablespoon, maybe two maximum you can't put more it will fall Cup your hands do this Hamdulillah game over No, Sheikh. I am afraid of this corner and this corner. I have to bring outside examiners with a magnifying glass to see if if it's covered or not, and then I have to bring something that would Measure the humidity so that if there is water or it's dry. What is this? This is not Islam Aki that you're practicing call it. Whatever religion you want Buddhism Hinduism. It's not Islam Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity You're not practicing that so you're not practicing Islam Islam was revealed for the shepherds for the farmers for the Bedouins for the nomads and They all perform wudu in the best of way and their prayer is ten times better than yours and mine And they don't even know how to read a book of Fiqh, but why because they have Iman they have belief they have trust in Allah and They don't have to convince every time they call salam alaikum. I have OCD Nice speaking to you. I have three cars Why do you identify yourself? Sad news is nobody's feeling sorry for you if you're unable to do so Keep convincing yourself. You're a bird and you will turn to be a bird and you will try to fly Don't be proud of it be ashamed of it hide it conceal it so you can fight it But when you as they say come from out of the closet Then you don't want to fight it. You want to announce it to everybody. So be careful lucky"
