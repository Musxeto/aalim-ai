  "transcript": "Question from a viewer Wa Jazakum. First of all, logically, Akhi, you will not be sinful because he's not asking for your car. Rather, he's asking for his own car to be returned back to him. You are not his father. You have no control over him to say, no, I'm not giving you my car so that you won't go to a wedding. It is his car. So, this doesn't make any sense. To borrow his car to go to a mall or to anywhere you want, which he kindly allows you to, then you want to reverse this and control his actions by judging him and saying that you can't go to such a wedding. Number two, again you're judging your father, saying that he's going to a wedding and there will be free mixing and there will be music and maybe haram drinks etc. Who are you to judge him? You have no authority over him and you don't even know whether he will be participating in these haram events or not. Whether he's going there to go and tell them this is haram, you should stop this, this is haram, you may not participate in this. So, he would do his communal duty and obligation in enforcing what is righteous and virtuous and preventing what is evil and vice. So, you don't have the right to do this. So, in a nutshell, my friend, you cannot control your father. You cannot decide what he does or he does not. He's a grown man and he has the authority over you. Yes, you may not assist him in haram. That is obvious and clear when you have the ability to refrain. As in the case if he tells you go and fetch me a bottle of beer or buy me cigarettes, this is something haram. You cannot do this and you have to hold your grounds and diplomatically and respectfully decline telling him that Allah has prevented me and prohibited me from doing this and I hope this makes some sense."
