  "title": "Kufr is Shirk and Shirk is Kufr? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Rakib from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh my question was I saw one of your videos where you said that Kufr is Shirk and Shirk is Kufr. Would you please throw some light on it and explain it a bit? Kufr is disbelief. Shirk is associating others with Allah Azza Wa Jal. So both of them take a person out of the fold of Islam. Both of them guarantee a seat for an individual in the lower places and levels of hellfire for eternity. And there is no hope for such a person who dies on Kufr or Shirk. However, when a person disbelieves, if a person disbelieves in Allah Azza Wa Jal, he says I don't believe in the existence of Allah. He's an atheist. And I don't worship other than with Allah Azza Wa Jal. Actually he's worshipping his desires and whims. So he's associating others with Allah by worshipping his desires and whims. And likewise a person who says I believe in Allah but I worship other with Allah Azza Wa Jal, he's a mushrik but at the same time he committed an act of blasphemy, of disbelief, by not worshipping Allah alone and insisting on disbelieving that Allah Azza Wa Jal is the only worthy of being worshipped among all gods, subhanahu wa ta'ala. Allah Azza Wa Jal and I hope this makes sense."
