  "transcript": "Adik Anul from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh If two followers join someone praying, so of course the person is now the Imam and eventually loses his ablution, how will the followers know who to be the next Imam and how to continue the prayer? Since they don't know the rakah he is in before the Imam lost his ablution. If two people joined an Imam in prayer and the Imam happens to lose or break his wudu, one of them has to move forward. Usually they are not going to toss a coin. Usually they are not going to invite one another, please be my guest, no, please, please. One of them is going to just move forward. And the first one to do this would become the Imam. If there are two of them, then usually it's the one on the left who becomes the Imam, so that the one on the right would be the follower. And even if they don't know what rakah the Imam was in, for them they should resume the prayer from where they started. So if this happened in their first rakah while it was in the fourth rakah of the Imam, it doesn't matter, they continue to pray this as the first rakah, second, third and fourth and conclude their prayer and Allah knows best."
