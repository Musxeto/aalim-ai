  "transcript": "Sagar Dal from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, my question is that my family wants to go to a wedding or it is Mehndi or Walima so there will be free mixing and music so I avoid going with them but they want to go so if they are going they will most likely take the cab and that is how they will go or am I allowed to just drop them over there that is all Jazakum Allah Khair Wa Jazakum personally I say no you should not drop them because you are assisting them on sin and you cannot assist them or collaborate with them on such a sin while they know that this is Haram yes you taking them there would probably minimize the sin a little bit but because they are one or two or more going with a taxi driver there is no seclusion the sin is on them and Allah knows best Jazakum Allah Khair"
