  "title": "Specify intention for Sadaqa or Zakat when donating? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Areej from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi My question is about donations, you know, do we need to specify an intent for the specific donation type like Zakat, Sadaqah, Fidya, Kafara and so on or it's the general donation considered inclusive of all or any of these categories for example If I donate to sponsor an orphan or provide a monthly food donation for a family Would this be classified as Zakat automatically without spacing finance seeking guidance on this matter? Wa Jazakum. The Prophet Alayhis Salaatu Wassalam Indicated that Innamal A'malu Binniyat Deeds are By what a person intends them to be and This means that all forms of worship if They do not include an intention Then it's like someone Getting in his car in the morning that is That's having a full gas tank starts early and drives without any destination He will reach nowhere pretty quick Because he doesn't have a destination and the intention is your destination. So if I give a thousand quid and I don't have an intention. This can never be Zakat Allah will never accept this as a Zakat Because the Zakat has to have a prior intention before giving the money if I give Someone who's in real need in hospital and he cannot pay his medical expenses and I give him a thousand pounds And after I walk away I said hmm. He's needy. He's very poor. Okay. This is my Zakat money. It doesn't work Because before giving the money it you should have had the intention of Zakat It's like someone waking up in the morning Offering Fajr prayer and after a couple of hours He did not eat or drink anything since the Adhan. He says hmm I think I have a missed day since last year's Ramadan. So I'm gonna make it today This is not valid because the intention was not prior to the break of dawn and The Prophet said alayhi salatu wasalam whoever does not have the intention to fast Mandatory or obligatory fast before the break of dawn that is at nighttime. His fast is invalid Yes, I can fast voluntary Anything I give away Can be voluntary Nafl charity But anything that is mandatory whether it's a Fard Zakat An expiation which is also mandatory for an oath that I broke or for a sin that I made An oath or a pledge or a vow that I made It has to have the prior intention or it won't be valid You"
