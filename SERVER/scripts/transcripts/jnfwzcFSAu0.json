  "title": "Only Mother Aisha did this || assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "This was never done by any of the companions of the Prophet ï·º with the exception of Mother Aisha. And the whole of the Salaf, the scholars, the Tabi'een, they did not recommend or liked to perform Umrah except once for every journey. And what we see from the brothers coming and performing Umrah, then shaving part of their head, going to Masjid Aisha, doing Ihram and coming for another Umrah and shaving another head, and they end up like Mr. T. I have three more Umrahs In Sha Allah. What is this? No, this is not from the Sunnah. But is it accepted? Answer is yes. But you want what? You want reward. You want Sunnah. You want Ajr. Now, if someone says, Sheikh, I'm coming from a very long, far away place. I don't have money. And probably this is the Umrah that I can do. And the next one can be after maybe 15 years. I don't know if I'm going to live that long. So I'd like to make a Umrah for myself, for my late father, for my late mom, for my siblings who are all dead. Because I know I'm not going to come except after 10 or 15 years. I say In Sha Allah. Allah Karim. But those who live in Kuwait, come on, give me a break. You can come every week. You can come every month. So this is not recommended at all. And Allah knows best."
