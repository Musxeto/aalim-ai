  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, so my question is I have friends who remix and platonically befriend the opposite gender. How should I advise them and what hadith should I use? Jazak Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum. First of all, you are obliged to take care of yourself first. Cleanse your heart. Be sure that you are on the right path taking you to Jannah. Why do I say this? Because your friends, they can influence you positively and negatively. So if you have such friends who have the concept of boyfriend, girlfriend and party and do drugs, and you still have them as your friends, you're in great danger. It's like quicksand. Shortly, you'll be drowned. Therefore, you have to get rid of such friends, boycott them, delete them from your contact list and move on to righteous practicing friends. Once you have the knowledge and the strength of Iman that enables you to give da'wah and to counter their mocking and ridiculing and their doubts that they have over some of these wrong things that they're doing, then you can go and maybe give them da'wah while keeping your distance from being affected negatively by their company. Before that, know you have to stay away and learn your religion and associate yourself with practicing righteous Muslims 24 hours seven days a week."
