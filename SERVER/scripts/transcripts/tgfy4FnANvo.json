  "title": "Praying in clothes with images? What about children wearing images of cartoons? | AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "Sabiha says i want to know is it prohibited to offer salah in the garment or clothes on which images of human beings and animals are printed the prohibition is not in the prayer itself but in wearing such clothes so if a person wears a t-shirt with the image of a human being or of an animal or of a cartoon character or of a celebrity all of this is prohibited the Prophet said alehissalaam salaam the angels do not enter a house where there is an image a statue or a dog so by wearing these t-shirts or clothes that have such prints you will prevent the Angels from protecting you with the grace of allah azza wajal and the most dangerous is when children wear this because children do not read the earth car they do not purify themselves well after answering the call of nature due to their agent ignorant so you add to that all wearing these images and pictures and and and the likes this definitely would endanger your child and the devil's would have more control then you would wish they did so it's best to avoid this totally from the children now does it impact my prayer the most authentic opinion it does not it reduces the reward but the prayer itself is valid and your sinful without any doubt for wearing such clothes"
