  "title": "How can a woman get a  husband if her daily activities include only home & office?",
  "transcript": "If there are unmarried women and daily activities are only in the office and mostly in the bedroom, what route can she get her husband? So, if I understand your question. No, he understands. Do you want me to say go and have dating? This is not acceptable. We are Muslims and Muslims have a Sharia. So, Allah did not bring you the husband yet. You make dua, you ask Allah and you observe your chastity and become a good practicing Muslim. You are not allowed to go around and talk to boys or talk to men or flirt on Tinder. This is totally haram in Islam. We do not have these things. A man is chaste and fearing Allah and bashful. A woman is fearing Allah and bashful. And if there is Khair, Allah will send it to you. And if there is no Khair, wait for it, it will come Inshallah. Al Fatiha."
