  "transcript": "Mustafa from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Yes, Sheikh whenever I've shared something Islamic with others I've generally received a negative response and sometimes things have been really ridiculous. I mean I can Provide an example, but I know we have limited time so only if you ask me to But really I get reactions like I've gone crazy I've you know become a mullah and no one should listen to me So I saw a few of your videos and from now onwards I'm thinking that I'm just gonna ignore such ignorant people and only speak to them about Islamic topics if they're genuinely interested because otherwise, I'm just gonna be wasting my time and Even if they do ask me about something and I know the answer I'm not gonna reply because based on past experience. They're perhaps, you know, just looking for a silly argument And not to seek the truth So if I do the Sheikh like not reply while fully knowing the answer would this be considered a form of concealing knowledge? The answer the answer is no when you know that someone is pulling your legs he's asking just to make fun or To make you answer and then make fun of religion or of your answer Then yes Turn the table on their heads and make fun of them and don't give them an answer and this is not concealing Knowledge those who are genuine and want to learn. Yes, you can answer them without any problem"
