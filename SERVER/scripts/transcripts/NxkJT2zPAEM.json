  "transcript": "his second question was if I understand it correctly about giving zakat money to a charity organization and later on we discovered that this is a fraud organization so there is this organization I give them a thousand euros hoping that they distributed in the cat and later on I discovered that they were crooks should I consider that done the answer is no this is a debt to allah azzawajal so giving it to someone who's not deserving is different than giving it to a bogus organization to distribute it so for example if I give a thousand euros to my brother and I tell him to distribute it and he's trustworthy but he dies and the money is within him or with him or the money is burnt aways destroyed out of an act of nature out of his control so he comes to me said I'm sorry the money is gone I forgive him because he was doing me a favor but I still have to pay a thousand of zakat to the needy and likewise in the issue of this corrupt organization and Allah social knows best"
