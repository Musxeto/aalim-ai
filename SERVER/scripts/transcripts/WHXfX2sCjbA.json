  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] alhamdulillah for dear brothers and sisters in Islam in today's episode we will begin with the grace of Allah in trying to dissect the ways the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam dealt with people's mistakes and errors and also their sins and how he tackled it so that we would have an understanding of how to deal if we were to be faced in such circumstances or in similar scenarios and this is quite important because so many of us may think that the best approach to deal with people's mistakes is to tackle it headon without looking into the circumstances sometimes I sit with couples in counseling and I discover that the marital problems are often caused by one of the spouses being more aggressive in committing to his practice of the religion so they started in a particular level not necessarily adhering to the laws of Shar and one of them gets Guided by Allah asael and he feels that he wants to develop and progress in adopting Islam into his life however he does not take this holistically he chooses and picks only aspects that are fine with his whims and desires and neglect the rest of the religion so some of them you might find them focusing on their husbands wearing the beard you must wear the beard don't shave or that their husband should do this or do that or the wife should wear the nikab not only the hijab and she should do this and that and this is all good this is part of Shar but when it is shoved down people's throats without seeing the holistic picture how the prophet used to deal with his spouses sallallahu alai Ali wasallam what's the etiquette what's the attitude then there is this imbalance which may cause the spouse to repel and reject rulings of Islam saying that if Islam is like this I don't want it this is kuur but in one way or the other it is the spouse that contributed to such an attitude when they don't know how to deal with their spouses when they don't know how to tackle a particular mistake or error when they exaggerate the size of the mistake which we spoke about in previous episodes this is where the imbalance take place and this is where we have a problem so we need to learn not one but all the scenarios that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam dealt with those who made mistakes and errors so that we can have an understanding and a true adaptation of the way of the Prophet because as we mentioned earlier some cases the prophet was so soft and lenient and in similar cases he was very strict and harsh if one adopts only one methodology there would be an imbalance so if you're always strict and harsh in enforcing what is righteous and good that would cause an imbalance and people would always Point their finger at you not accusing you rather accusing Islam and if you're too lenient and soft when it's time to be harsh and strict people would think that Islam is not suitable you have to do the balance you have to know when to do this and when to do that and this can only be done if you acquire the knowledge of the how the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam dealt with different scenarios so that you can estimate and evaluate and act accordingly so the first point in the prophet's methodology Sall alai wasallam in dealing with people's mistakes is to hasten to deal with people's mistake and not to put them off what does that mean it means that the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam as a teacher as a mentor as a messenger of Allah would not delay explaining things to people and showing them what is right and what is wrong because that would cause a great deal of problems most likely it wouldn't be the appropriate time and people would forget and the benefit would be lost and this is found all over the place and one may argue that this is most suitable for the prophet sallallahu alaih alhi wasallam because he's the Muslim ruler he's the messenger of Allah he's the only one qualified to say and teach most likely we can do the same and adopt the same methodology but we have to weigh the consequences sometimes we need to wait unlike the prophet Al we don't have the authority we don't have the love and respect of the people to the prophet sallallahu alaih so it might be in some cases more logical to delay and postpone your correction until the time is fit generally speaking the proph phet always corrected mistakes on the spot never delayed it we have many many examples such as for example when a man came and he prayed two RA in the Masjid while the prophet was looking at himam then he came over and gave Salam to The Prophet by saying the prophet replied by saying go back and pray you have not prayed and the man did this three times and in the third time he said by the one who had sent you by the truth I don't know how to pray better than what I had just done so teach me so the prophet taught himat the prophet could have turned a blind eye and looked the other way and maybe gave a speech a week later a month later teaching people how to pray that would have been a good thing to do but the benefit would have been lost because this individual may not would not have attended maybe may have gone or traveled may have forgotten what he had done of mistakes and thought that oh the prophet is teaching someone else not me however the prophet Sall wasallam taught him on the spot the woman who stole from B and we spoke about this couple of episode earlier and the prophet ordered that her hand would be amputated or cut off because of her crme crime when us Z came to intercede the prophet did not let this slip and go rather he stopped him on the spot and scolded him and reprimanded him for interceding in one of Allah's prescribed punishments when came back from collecting zakat from all over the country as per the instruct instruction of the prophet alham he came back with the zakat money camels cows sheep harvested crops and he said this is your zakat and this portion was given to me as a gift the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam stopped him immediately and said why would they give you something for your own if it was not for your occupation and duty if you were to sit in your father and mother's house and not go and collect the zakat from them would have they given you anything the answer is no definitely not so this is the definition of bribe the prophet stopped it immediately usam when he came back from the battlefield Victorious and the prophet was jubilant and happy because of of his victory and he was telling the prophet Sall wasallam about his achievements but when he came to the part where he was fighting someone who was a fierce enemy and a strong fighter and a warrior and how he confronted him and they exchanged blows just before finishing it the man felt that Usama was going to finish him off the man said the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam anticipated what Usama was going to do and when us told him that he killed him and finished him off the prophet was outraged you killed him after saying ill so the prophet corrected the mistake and we will talk about this later on inshallah in future episodes so all of these narrations indic at to us that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam would not let things slide he would correct the mistakes and the errors on the spot head on because there's not enough time and if things were to be delayed then the benefit would have been lost this is the general Trend by the way how however the prophet Alat wasam May delay when the cons outweigh the pros how is that for example it was reported in theah so this is an authentic Hadith two men were arguing and the argument got heated so they started to fight and their voices Rose and one of them had a rage fit so his eyes were red his veins were popping and it was obvious that this guy's in real rage the prophet saw this Al am he could have intervened he could have said something but weighing the consequences the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam thought it was wise not to do anything however he taught his companions about what was happening and he said I know a phrase if he were to say it Allah would relieve him from this r fit and then he explained to them I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan this phrase is very easy the prophet could have gone and said it to the man the prophet could have appointed one of his companions to go and say to them man but he did not he knew that this would backfire and cause more problems that's why he refrained unfortunately one of the companions took the initiative upon himself and went without seeking permission from the prophet to take tell the man so he came and he said to him hey the prophet says sallallahu alhi wasallam I know a phrase if this man would say Allah would relieve him from what he's suffering from the man was expecting that by saying to him that the prophet said this that he would calm down and say the phrase and all was good unfortunately what the prophet wasam was afraid of took place instead of the man calming down he burst into more anger and pushed the man away saying to him go away from me what do you think I'm crazy so he rejected out of anger without feeling himself the advice and the recommendation of the Prophet whose mistake was it definitely it was that Good Samaritan good companion who thought that he would be doing good for the man by delivering the message of the Prophet Alat wasam not thinking that the prophet could have done this the prophet could have ordered him but he didn't so sometimes even the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam would refrain from showing the truth and correcting the mistakes because this might cause a further harm and this depends on the knowledge of the D of the teacher this depends on his wisdom and his evaluation of what's right and what's wrong and this is why we have to always be spot on we need to evaluate things with the scale of sh not through our whims and desires not through our enthusiasm or our cowardness sometimes we're coward sometimes we're scared sometimes we're overal and we may may do things that are not smart I remember one of the great Scholars of Islam who was invited to deliver a lecture in a government facility so he went along with his students and Entourage and when they entered the lecture hall the she saw portraits of some of the officials so he requested the MC if it's possible to remove these pictures and the MC was outrageous said no how dare you ask for such a thing the Sheik's students wanted to make a fuzz the Sheik did not make any fuz but his students thought that being loyal being uh true students we should make or put a fight when the she saw this immediately he said okay I think it's best that we go to the Masjid rather than doing it in this lecture hall he defused it he did not give a lecture to the MC and to the authority that this is Haram because he knows that this is fruitless they wouldn't care about the ruling so he diffused it by going to the Masjid this kind of wisdom is extremely needed nowadays you have to calm down lower your voice weigh the pros and the cons not for your sake rather for the sake of Islam for the benefit of the Muslims for the benefit of the Daw so that it would not be hindered or stopped and this is what we learn when we study the of the Prophet Alat as a source of knowledge and information one of the brothers I was doing counseling with who wife was so mad and was at the verge of asking for divorce was telling me I'm shoving everything down her throat ordering to do this and to do that and I was asking him what you're doing is it part of the way of the Prophet Alat wasam in dealing with people speaking about those who don't have a beard as if they've committed the cardinal sin as if they're cafir it's a sin but it's not to that extent that you resent people and you want to spit in their faces is this the way of the prophet he said no so I asked him how was the prophet with his wives was he preaching them about Islam 24 hours 7 days a week said I don't know I didn't I didn't study the S I only uh studied the AA Subhan Allah this is the imbalance we're talking about the AA you're studying is not the correct AA that shows you how to worship Allah in the best of Fashion on and manners rather it shows you the difference between and mat and J Etc it teaches you about all sects of Islam but not about your own so you keep on studying different sects being confused yet happy that you have knowledge which is not beneficial for you at this stage of time and the evidence is that you're almost going to divorce your wife or she's going to file for learn the alongside with the alongside with the and definitely you have to learn the so that you have the the knowledge the eates all in one Melting Pot to be a proper Muslim and Allah Knows Best"
