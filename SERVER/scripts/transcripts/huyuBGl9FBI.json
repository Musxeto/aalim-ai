  "title": "What is the difference between lottery and investing money in a business? Aren't they both gambling?",
  "transcript": "I met since a question and he has a problem in differentiating between lottery which is gambling and investing money in business which is susceptible to gain and loss profit and loss so he says it's the same principle if I buy if I deposit money for example he says let me see exactly if I deposit money in a pool then buying a lucky draw ticket to win a reward versus investing money in a business and then expecting reward isn't this the same scenario the answer is no it is exactly like the people of ignorance times of jahiliya the disbelievers when Allah told us that usually or Reba or interest over loans which is a major sin when Allah told us it is haram they said it's like commerce it's like selling and buying allah says wahdahu la la who air Muharram Areva Allah has made transactions and selling and buying commerce halal where he had made usually a RIBA to be prohibited the whole world of difference between usury between gambling which depends on luck see you when you deposit your money and you're able to get a lucky draw whatever you get from this lucky draw is considered to be interest it's not gambling because you have not lost anything so I give a bank a million dollars and they tell me that we have a thousand customers of our of ours who will be participating in a draw and whoever wins gets a car so I lose I don't get a car only one of the customers does but at the end of the day I'm going to take my money back the same amount this is usually if I win it is RIBA it's like the same transaction that is taking place in the subcontinent a lot and elsewhere where I go to the owner of a house and I tell him I'll give you a deposit of three million dollars what kind of a deposit is this he says yes it's in case you do something wrong in the house so I give him three million dollars and I live in this big mansion for nothing or for $50 a month as rent and after three or five years when I want to leave and move out he returns the three million dollars to me this is clear Reba this is not selling and buying this is not renting this is a loan of three million with the interest being me living in that mansion gambling is different I buy a lottery ticket for ten dollars I may hit the jackpot and win four hundred million dollars and I may not win anything who cares ten ten dollars is nothing to some this is gambling this is may sir this is totally prohibited whereas if I buy stocks and goods for a hundred thousand euros and I bring them over and I sell them I may make a profit in a may make a loss this is possible however the money circulation has benefited a great deal of people so it benefited the one who sells the raw material it benefited the workers who work in the factory the owner of the factory the engineers who engineered it the warehouse the transportation the people buying it here this makes the money productive and useful not as when you have a loan shark who just sits there and gives you a hundred and demands 120 in return this is not benefiting anyone except the loan shark he gets richer and everyone else gets poorer especially if there is a loss etc so I hope this answers your question"
