  "transcript": "uh shaka says i use a credit card for day-to-day purchases and pay my balance in full at the end of every month so i do not incur any interest or ribba with this credit card after every three to four months i get vouchers to spend in a shop the value of the vouchers is dependent on how much i had spent on the credit cards is using these vouchers sinful this is known as cashback and i think i've answered a similar question many times before but because the question is there we will answer it again cashback is halal depending on the institution that it is giving it to you meaning why do we say that if i open a bank account and they refund me or give me instantly a hundred dollars as a gift why do we say that this hundred dollars is haram and river isn't this similar to cash back the answer would be is to understand what is the relationship between me and this financial institution when i go to a bank and i have a bundle of cash and i open a bank account what will the bank do with this money if they would put it in a safe deposit box not to touch it not to use it in this case this is known as a manner is it a deposit even if the bank was burned to the ground in addition to my money i cannot come and say give me my money back they said it's gone it's burnt i can't say this is none of my business i gave you my money as a deposit and you would say yes but the bank was burned to the ground it's not our fault it's an act of allah azzawajal and a forced major as they call it in this case yes if they give you cash back there's no problem because you did not lend them anything but anyone who goes and opens a bank account and deposits his money his money is a loan to the bank that's why the bank takes it deals with it lends it to other in riba invests it in stocks or in any whatever it wants so if the branch was burned to the ground i can claim my money an hour later and the bank is forced to give it back to me because because it is not in a manner it is an actual loan from me to the bank therefore if the bank gives me calendars or pens or gifts if i'm a and a vip customer and they give me a cell phone at the end of the year as a token of appreciation this is all haram river if you understand this concept now we move on to cashbacks credit cards are lending you money and you have 40 days grace period to pay them back or they will charge you with riba so here you're not lending them they're lending you so shocker if it is as you say that you pay before the grace period is over so there's no river none whatsoever and i will not go into the ruling of getting a credit card but if you have one already and you buy and you pay them immediately and they give you cash back this is okay you can use the voucher you can use the money no problem with that but if you have a debit card a debit card is a card that you charge with money so you give them money in advance so that you can use it now you are lending the debit card company money and you're using it over time and they're giving you cash back this is interest on the loan that you had given them likewise apps that require that you give them money so you deposit 10 000 reals and you can transfer money with that and you can pay your phone bills you can pay electricity bills you can do whatever you want until it is over then you have to recharge it again and they give you a cash back it's the same concept you're lending them money and they're giving you profit and percentage and allah azza knows better you"
