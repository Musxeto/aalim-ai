  "transcript": "rifat says that he has a problem with ocd obsessive-compulsive disorder and a lot of the muslims who start to practice who start to learn about their religion shaytan attacks them through ocd those who are negligent who don't know where the qibla is who don't know what russell is he doesn't even care to bother them he just focuses on throwing desires and lusts and sins on them so whoever starts to practice gets these whispers gets these intrusive thoughts and gets these whispers regarding purity so they perform russell five times islam is a religion of simplicity it's a religion that is good for a rocket scientist and for a shepherd so it is not something complicated the way you're doing it is not part of islam taking russell is to just simply cover your a whole body in water turning the water in your mouth and sniffing up your nostrils and blowing it blowing it up of course with your left hand the issue is that people when they don't have knowledge they start thinking about the details and as they say the devil is in the details so they say okay what about the area underneath my nails what about this or that all of this is not mentioned nobody says ever in wudo or in russell that you have to go under your nails and wash it and clean it and what counts is what's on the surface some people have old skin so they say should we peel it off and maybe this would cause some wounds in order for the water to reach underneath who says that the water has to reach underneath it's only their whims and desires if they were to follow sharia they would not have had any problems"
