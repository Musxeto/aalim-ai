  "transcript": "fatima says how can i practice getting up early for Fechter are there any practical ways for this first of all you have to analyze yourself assuming that you have a flight at 3:30 a.m. would you ever miss your flight the answer is no why because your mind is preoccupied with your journey you're looking up for it you're looking for a you're anticipating it and it's something that occupies your mind when you come to salat al-fajr unfortunately it is at the LES at at the bottom of our lists and this shows you the amount of Eman we have in our hearts in some countries that I travel to I ask the brother that receives me from the airport and he's working for Isaac or for the Dawa or whatever he's organizing all these dau activities and he looks practising masha'Allah and I ask him how many fetchers do you miss every month hoping to hear none and I'm shocked to hear him say well Mahesh if I pray twice or three times a month that's good and I say how is this possible for a Muslim to miss so many fudger with the congregation he said I stay late until 1 or 2 a.m. doing leaflets and and designing banners and organizing conferences that I'm so tired I oversleep this is unacceptable your priority should be your salat which is a pillar of Islam so now for you Fatima you have to reschedule your daily tasks so that the priority is for select so we I ask people what time do you go to bed they always say 12:00 or 1:00 a.m. how do you expect to wake up at 4:00 if you sleep this late so though I try I put six or seven alarm clocks and it doesn't work of course it doesn't work you need to put a cannon next to your ear so that you would wake up if you know that this is what's happening then you have to reschedule your daily schedule so that you sleep immediately after Asia and before you go to sleep you fill up your stomach with water so alongside with the alarm clocks you will be forced to wake up so that you can go to the bathroom and answer the call of nature so you have two factors helping one another you also have to read more and learn more about your religion about Islam about Allods that were Gelinas beautiful names and attributes you have to recite the Quran learn the meanings of it you have to read the biography of the Prophet the Sira sallallahu alaihi wasallam to know how he lived how his companions lived how their lives revolved around Islam and not the other way around so they based their lives according to Islam and this is what they lived by and died for once you manage to do this there will be transformation in your life a positive one that you would feel the sweetness of a man with the grace of allah azza wajal"
