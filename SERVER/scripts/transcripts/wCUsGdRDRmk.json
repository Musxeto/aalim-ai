  "transcript": "and the first one is from ahmed ahmed says during the monsoons in the subcontinent it rains heavily and almost every day and there are puddles on the roads many stray animals like dogs cats etc would urinate and defecate on the road so if such water splashes on us must we wash the affected clothes and body parts alhamdulillah allah azza has made islam a religion of ease so there is no hardship in it and whenever there is hardship things become easy and a rule of thumb is that everything on earth is pure until proven otherwise and this is a very important rule especially for those who suffer from ocd those who suspect the doorknobs and the light switches and everything in the house is it pure or not everything by default is pure until proven otherwise likewise the puddles on the road they are pure not that we're saying they are clean meaning that no one asks you to go and drink from it it's not hygienic of course but when we talk about pure and impure we refer to a religious labeling where you can or cannot pray if you have this on you so if i have a drop of urine on my clothes i cannot pray my prayer would be invalid if i do this knowingly so now these puddles they're muddy they're murky they have a bad smell maybe if some of it comes on my clothes or my body can i pray well the default as mentioned earlier everything is pure until proven otherwise suspecting that maybe it's mixed with urine or with sewer water or with faeces of animals the suspicion itself does not render it impure therefore you can pray without washing the affected area and maybe it would help to know that um once was with a friend of his walking down the roads of medina when all of a sudden water fell on them from the roof of one of the houses so the man called upon the owner of the house o owner of the house is the water that was poured on us pure is it taher are you washing the roof or is it mixed with impurities it sounded like a legitimate question omar may allah be pleased with him shouted at the man o owner of the house do not tell us because this would be an exaggeration this would be something going beyond the sunnah to investigate what it is by default known to us to be pure so we should not investigate and go down that alley and allah azza knows best you"
