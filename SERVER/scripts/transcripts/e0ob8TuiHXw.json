  "title": "Should women be stopped from entering the Masjid",
  "transcript": "uh zaim from India I understood my question I heard this scholar reading regarding the woman or not so he said that mother Aisha said uh if profit would be during this time so and so when she narrated then process would have been stopped a woman from entering into Masjid so he says we take this saying of the sahaba as well as saying of sahaba is and hence they have stopped women from praying into Masjid but uh what I have heard from you is it is uh permissible for a woman to go and train Masjid to work how to deal with this and what to say to that scholar or how to give drama to these people I want to ask you that first of all what mother Aisha said was not to go against the prophet's teaching may Allah forbid no way any of the companions would even dare to do such a thing and the evidence that backs this up Isha never stopped women from going to the Masjid Abu Bakr Omar Usman Ali and all the righteous caliphs of the Companions and the tabirin Never Ever Had dared to stop women from praying in the Masjid so we address this honorable scholar and say do you know more than them yes or no if he says yes then he is an ignorant imbecile put him in the trash can if he says no may Allah forbid the companions were no way more than I do we say wouldn't it be safer for you or Muslim to follow their footsteps so that you would end up with them in Jannah to nahim in for those hopefully rather than go against the teachings of the Prophet Allah who he himself said do not this is a prophet's words do not prevent women from attending the prayer in the Masjid this is his command and we know that Allah has perfected the religion completed his favor upon us and accepted Islam to be our religion as per chapter 5 Surah so who dares come and say yes the prophet ordered us not to prevent them but we will prevent them are you a Muslim yeah don't you listen to what you say make a voice note of your allegation and listen to it tomorrow and probably you slap yourself and condemn yourself of of such blasphemy the son of Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him that is Abdullah and with his father that is his son heard his father once say I heard the prophet said do not prevent women from attending the prayer in the Masjid out of jealousy his own son said by Allah we will prevent them now what he meant that because of the fitna because of the wrong doings we think that we will prevent them just to reduce the amount of fitna not to go against the prophet's uh uh command Allah but it came out in a heinous way in a very bad and inappropriate and an insulting way may Allah be pleased with him was outraged the narrator of the Hadith says I have never heard Abdullah curse or say bad words in my life like that day so he cursed his son and used all bad words in the dictionary against him and he's saying to him I tell you the prophet says do not prevent them and you said we will prevent them go for Allah I will never speak to you till the day I die and Abdullah kept his word he did not speak with his son despite his attempts to apologize to seek Allah's forgiveness to explain himself he never spoke to his son because of his inappropriate actions so you tell this so-called scholar fear Allah and don't go against the prophet that Islam just to please your peers and your Scholars and the community rather please Allah azzawajal and follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Islam if you are a true Muslim"
