  "transcript": "[Music] we know that the time before the slave is a time for dua so if i don't use the words of request does it come under idol talking that alpha is the prayer so if i say all i didn't realize that such was your power okay then what like i'm not requesting does it invalidate because of idle talking if you're not requesting if you're not asking are you praising allah yeah in a sense yeah there's no problem in that because you're doing my remorse no no problem because praising allah is a form of dua dua is divided into two types either just to say allah this is praising allah and this is dua but the other type of dua is asking allah allah forgive me allah give me allah provide for me i hope this answers your question you"
