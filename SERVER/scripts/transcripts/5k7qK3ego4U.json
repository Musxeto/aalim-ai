  "transcript": "Salman says is it permissible to eat sweets with gelatin that are available in the Western markets what about the gelatin powder that you get in the supermarkets for making desserts this issue of gelatin is an issue of dispute we know that gelatin is made primarily from animals so if it is halal animals like sheep cows camels that were slaughtered in a halal way we have no problem in that no one doubts the permissibility of that the problem is when it is made of dead meat or even made of pork where the issue comes up because the meat is nudges so how can we eat it so the scholars were divided as usual one say it is Haram without any further discussion because of the presence of such Haram ingredients and this is safest opinion of all the second group of scholars said that we have a concept in Islam there is called East Ajala which means roughly two transformation so a substance that is impure there is Nadja's there is haram if it is transferred totally to a new substance that is not related in its physical or chemical characteristics to the first one then Halla and they give an example of a dog that falls in a pit of salt you know at some beaches you'll find a pit of salt where seawater collects and it dries and then there's the salt that remains there if a dog falls in one dies and a few weeks later we come and we find that the dog itself the body the hair the bones due to the effect of the salt is no longer existing it vanished it turned itself not by itself but it was turned into salt so there's no smell no color no remains scholars say that the salt itself is halal and it is permissible to consume how a dog just died yes but it was transformed into a new substance which is salt likewise when we get milk from a cow for example the origin of milk is blood and whatever is in the guts off of the intestines of the cow things will things that are not pure but look what it turned into milk no one can say that milk is haram because the origin of the milk is not pure but now milk itself is a totally different substance so this group of scholars consider gelatin part of this process because the Haram meat undergoes a rigorous process that changes it totally - a new substance so this is what I feel comfortable with but definitely the most safest opinion is to avoid it and if you have alternatives you are highly recommended to avoid it and allah azzawajal knows best"
