  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Japan um Sheikh would it be \npermissible to pray on wide and loose pants away   the wide and shorter blouse above knees is the \nprayer valid with such garment and how about going   out with such wide pants but with a bit longer \nblouse below knees what is mandatory upon a woman   is to wear ample and loose set of \nclothings that would not expose her awra   neither by being see-through nor by being tight \nand showing her bone structure and her curves   if a woman does not wear an outer garment \nlike Abaya and she prays with a very loose   top and trousers or a skirt the scholars say \nthat the prayer is valid but she's sinful for   not wearing an outer garment that would ensure \nthat her Aura is concealed definitely going out   with such an attire is not permissible because we \nman can see her waist can see her body curves and   whatever she does she will have to expose \nparts of her body that by Nature it's   something implanted in men that would attract \ntheir gaze and their attention and that is why   this is not permissible of her to go out with \nbut to pray in like if she prays in her as the   people in the subconscious continent call it \nthe prayer is valid but it is not recommended   and some would say that she's sinful for not \nwearing an outer garment and Allah Knows Best"
