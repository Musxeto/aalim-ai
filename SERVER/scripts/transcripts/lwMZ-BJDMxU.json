  "title": "Touch Coffin? ⚰️ Recite Surah Ikhlas 3 Times? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdullah from the US. Wa'alaykumussalam. Sheikh, my question is that if somebody passes away and after the janazah I see people touching the coffin and the Sheikh tells us to read three times. My question is, is this authentic? Okay, so touching the coffin is definitely not from the sunnah because putting a deceased in a coffin is not from the sunnah. The issue of coffins which is a wooden box is not from Islam at all. In Islam we are ordered to wash the deceased and to perfume him or her and then shroud them in three pieces of cloth or five if it's a woman and then take them as they are and place them in the grave. No coffin, no plastic bags, nothing. This is Islamic way of doing it. Putting him in a coffin, this is a western concept. So touching it, this is definitely not from Islam and reading Qul Huwa Allahu Ha three times or Ayatul Kursi or Al-Fatiha is definitely an innovation and whoever orders it is an innovator and such an imam should be taught that this is not from the sunnah and he should not make these bid'ahs and tell people to do them if he doesn't have an authentic evidence from the Qur'an or the sunnah backing it up and definitely he will not be able to back it up."
