  "transcript": "Afia from Dubai Afia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I want to ask question I Got married two years before my husband Married second he married second time Without knowing me just two months before He Actually, he cheated on me. He was in affair before getting married to that girl So after I knew I asked him to give me that I was so he's not giving me divorce He said no, I will not Leave he will not leave me so What to do? this is something that can't be explained or Discussed in few seconds because this is a life-changing decision Number one it doesn't matter whether he cheated on you or not Because even if he did not cheat on you and he still went and married someone else you would have asked for divorce and he would Have been angry number two if he did not marry and He continues to go and have a girlfriend in secret and you know about this Would you be happy or would you ask him to marry her the vast majority of Muslim women? They would say no, we are happy as long as we are the single wife. Let him cheat without any problem I would have Allah what kind of a Muslim woman would Encourage her husband to do such a thing thirdly Whether you want to stay in this relationship or not, this is entirely your own decision if you Ask him for to divorce you without any legitimate reason If he's capable of opening a house providing for you and being fair in Distributing his time and his gift and he's doing everything that Allah told him to do But still you are the one who doesn't want to then you are in deep trouble Because the Prophet said Alayhi salatu salam any woman who seeks divorce without a legitimate reason legitimate reason she will not find the scent and fragrance of Jannah and this is a Very strong warning. So if you have a legitimate reason you can apply for khalar go to the court and File a case against him pay him the mahar back and get your freedom He would be sad for a couple of weeks and he moves on with the new wife and probably take a second wife That is younger more beautiful and more righteous life goes on It's not gonna stop you on the other hand may find a big problem in three to six months time When you're all alone and nobody's proposing and maybe you don't have Any financial means to take care of you and then you start to regret and say whoops. What have I done? But then there's no going back if one goes to talk to him and say why don't you reconcile with your ex-wife? Is it you crazy? Now I've just tasted the taste of happiness of being alone from a woman who nags and complains I'm not accusing you. Don't judge me. I'm not gonna judge you. I don't know you But this is not the place to discuss these things. This requires a counseling session and Our time is up. So until we meet next Saturday"
