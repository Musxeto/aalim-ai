  "title": "Saving money to build a house, is it Zakatable & How to calculate Zakat on Cash",
  "transcript": "For those from Saudi, Sheikh I have a question regarding Zakah. If I have money and I'm collecting money for example for a year or so and I'm keeping it and I have an intention of using that money in building a house. So is this money, for example if it's in the bank for a year or so, so is this money liable for Zakah if I have an intention of using this money in building my house? Jazak Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum. Akhi, any money that is saved, whether it is to build a house or to get married or to send the children to school or to pay the rent or to pay off a debt, as long as it is in your possession and it is above the threshold and a whole hijrah year, a lunar year passed while it is in your possession, you are obliged to give 2.5% as Zakah of it and Allah Azzawajal knows best. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah. Al Fatiha."
