  "transcript": "Bailey from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh your classes on 40 hadith are truly helpful. I am watching them more than once. I pray that Allah grants barakah in your time so you can conduct more classes on hadith explanations like this. Ameen. Jazakumullah Khair. But I think tomorrow might be the last day because we are approaching the last 10 nights of Ramadan. I'm not sure yet. I'm not decided. But Jazakumullah Khair for your kind dua."
