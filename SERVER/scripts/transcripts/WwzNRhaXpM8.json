  "transcript": "Abraad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Sheikh, I was travelling long distance and I intended to pray Maghreb combined with Isha. Finally, I reached my city limit and I was told to become Imam and mistakenly I prayed Isha in congregation since it was Isha time. Then I recalled of not praying Maghreb as I had forgot. I was in dilemma during prayer regarding what I should do since my journey sequence was must. What I did was I completed the congregation and later prayed Maghreb. This enlighten me what I should have done in this situation. JazakAllah Khair. Wa Jazakum. What you've said is true. The sequence and the order of prayers must be followed. So it's Fajr followed by Dhuhr, Asr, Maghreb and Isha. If you went into prayer whether you are leading or a follower, so you went into Isha thinking that you've already prayed Maghreb or you did not think about Maghreb. It didn't cross your mind. And you prayed Isha. In the middle of Isha you said, what have I done? I didn't pray Maghreb. No problem, continue with your Isha and afterwards pray your Maghreb and this is Alhamdulillah forgiven by Allah the Almighty Azza wa Jal."
