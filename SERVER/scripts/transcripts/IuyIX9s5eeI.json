  "transcript": "Abdul Ghafoor from Sri Lanka. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam wa rahmatullah. Sheikh, Alhamdulillah I reverted one of my friends to Islam. Masha Allah. And it has come to my attention that he says he finds it difficult to pray at home because you know he comes from a Hinduistic background. So, and you know I try to take him for Salatul Jumaa as well on Fridays but you know because of his parents they question him every time. He's actually dependent on them. You know he doesn't have any income. So, what advice can you give me to teach him? In order to do his Salat on time? Abdul Ghafoor, Allah Azza Wa Jal says, فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ Fear Allah to the best of your ability. If someone is dependent on his family and they're hostile and offensive against Islam and the Muslims and he knows that he'll face a lot of hardship if not harm physically and mentally if they were to know. In this case, Alhamdulillah, he should conceal his Islam. He should pray whenever they're not present. Even if he has to pray in the toilet when it's locked or in his room if he can lock himself up. If it is difficult for him to go for Friday, he can skip Fridays. If he can go to uni or to work and pretend that he's going to uni and work and pray, Alhamdulillah. If not, then he should fear Allah to the best of his ability and may Allah make a way out for him. Alhamdulillah."
