  "transcript": "Tea from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh quick query just a few things I just want to uh two technicalities possibly and I just need to address one only so basically one oh yeah yeah yeah just um just so you understand what it is so a Muslim a closet Muslim who's concealing his Islam from his family say if he was uh if there was a birthday celebration at his house and he was trying to avoid it and then as he's walking in the main bit where it's all taking place his mother says oh son here's 10 or 20 pounds give it to your sister it's her birthday and then he crumbles and he did it and he's made Toba for it uh if he goes to his sister and says sister you know what I'm a Muslim I shouldn't have done that to you I shouldn't have given you that um she's gonna mock Islam make a mockery of him and if she take he gives him the money back it's not really his it's his mother's anyway and the mother's not going to accept it back should he make talk about forget about it and move on and try to let it be forgotten about um he's made Toba to Allah and he realizes why is it why is it always the same questions T you've asked me this yesterday and I told you to move on you don't have to go to old non-Muslim friends and tell them this was right and this was wrong or even Muslim friends that you may have collaborated with them on sin and just move on why is it that you're stuck and unable to move the moment you've accepted Islam this erases what's before it now whatever sins you do afterwards you ask Allah for forgiveness you don't have to make it deeper of a hole that you dig yourself in by explaining that you're a Muslim and please give me back the money with the money is not mine it's actually my mom I wasn't going to give you anything I wasn't going to wish you a happy birthday and you make things worse for you for Islam for your sister for your whole family move on you made a mistake Astaghfirullah may Allah forgive me do Toba and move on and forget all about it"
