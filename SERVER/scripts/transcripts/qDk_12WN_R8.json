  "transcript": "a sister says someone I'm really close to is asking about a sister they want for marriage for her brother and she wants in-depth detail about her past that I know of however I'm not sure if I should say it to her or not I'm also not sure how the sister is now if she's changed or is she as as the same as before do I say what I know about her too or stay quiet the scholars stated that backbiting known as RIBA is a major sin mentioned in the Quran chapter 49 totally prohibited however they stated that there are some situations where it becomes permissible and scholars differed in range of such permissibility so imam ashok anna may allah have mercy on his soul stated that you can simply say what is needed without any details shehas lament amia stated that it's okay for example if i go to a judge and i'd like to file a case against someone who robbed my house that would be backbiting because the thief doesn't like people to speak about him and he doesn't definitely want me to say such a thing but scholars say this is a legitimate reason and I can name the person as I complain someone is asking me about advice whether a person is interested in partnership with them so I know that this person is a crook his money's Haram and he has taken taken the wealth of so many investors before by claiming to be righteous fearing of Allah soldier yet he misinterprets and he takes the wealth of people abuses it and then says the business is lost so can I warn people definitely I have to tell them that this guy is a crook though he looks like a righteous person but he's not someone for example is asking for a fatwa a man or a woman comes to me say my husband does this and this and this and this what should I do so she's telling me about things that her husband doesn't want people to know of but she's seeking fatwa this is okay now when it comes to such cases of marriage a man comes to me and says a brother proposed to my daughter what do you know of this brother now I know that this brother is evil I have two ways one I can say everything about him like Sheikh is empty me I said he's drunkard he does crack he deals in RIBA he watches porn he has many illicit relationships with women I have two I can say that because I'd like to protect the brother who's asking me so that he would not fall into the trap and get his daughter involved with such garbage the other scholars say as long as his sins are concealed no one knows about them except me then it is sufficient for me to tell the brother okay he is bad news he says why what does he do I don't have to tell him that he's drunkard he does crack he does this and this and this no no I don't have to list it because this is something between him and Allah but I have to warn him that I know things if you trust me and you were asking me for advice I'm telling you this guy is no good he's bad news if he wants to take my word for it that handle if he doesn't this his problem not mine so if this is the case I hope yeah I need this answers a question now if you know bad things about her but you don't know if she had repented or not then in this case you tell them I know things that we're in the past where young girls used to do I'm not at liberty to expose her but I don't know if she had repented or not so you may ask someone else full stop and I hope this does the job"
