  "title": "Is the book about ‘The Life of the  Companions’ By Ali al-Sallabi reliable? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] from malaysia says there is a book for ali assalabi i think his name about the life of the companions is it permissible to read is it reliable i don't know the sheikh i've seen some of his work randomly and i don't know him personally and i have not read the book so it seems inshallah that it would be good because from their life we don't have halal and haram it's motivational stories um if you can rely on uh by the habi that would be much better and more reliable and allah"
