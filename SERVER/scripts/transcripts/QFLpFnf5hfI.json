  "transcript": "what is the ruling in Islam about the will of a person is there some percentage he can leave in a will even Omar may Allah be pleased with him said the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam it is not lawful for a man to sleep for three days without having his will meaning I didn't write my will today I didn't write my will tomorrow I didn't write my will the day after I would be sinful because it's a highly recommended thing to have your will so what is written in the will usually advice I advise my wife not to weep not to cry not to wail on me I advise my children to observe salat to remember always to make duaa for me and then you go to the financial aspects I have given fifty thousand riyals as alone to my brother I took on the thousand for my mother I need to pay this in that so you create things up now Islam gives you the right to donate or to give after your death or to allocate less than one-third of your wealth so I have property I have this I have that and I come to less than one-third and I say I would like to give this to she Hassan you can do this you can pray this in your will no problem shall and I am NOT one of your heirs so I'm not your son I'm not your father I'm not your definitely wife etc because writing a will to allocate money to one of your legitimate heirs is prohibited the Prophet Saracen lower Seattle you are if I cannot write in my will I a locate twenty thousand reals - my wife totally Haram it's invalid after I die they tear it and throw it in the garbage because she's inheriting 1/8 of whatever I owned by Sharia so the 1/3 or less can be given to a friend to an uncle to a nephew who's not one of your heirs to a grandson if I have sons but one of my sons died and he had grandchildren and by default when I died they don't inherit so I write something for them this is ok this is legitimate so the limit is 1/3 of what you possess so before executing your will they have to calculate how much you left from property gold silver cash stocks etc and the amount is X what is 1/3 of it is why the will is less than Y is okay green you can go it's more we cannot give you what's more we can only give you the located 1/3 so I hope this answers your question"
