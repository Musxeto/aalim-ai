  "title": "Can one gift EVERYTHING he has to an Adopted child before he dies? (inheritance)  | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and his second question is that if a person has an adopted child who happens to be his nephew and he wants to give him everything before his death as a gift there's not no problem in that at all whether he is married or not whether he has parents or children or not this is beside the point while i'm alive i can donate i can give as a gift everything i possess to anyone i want whether a relative or a stranger the issue is after death if the issue is dealing with after death writing a will has conditions one of the conditions is that you do not extend one third of your wealth condition two that you do not right this will to give from your wealth to anyone who is one of your heirs so i cannot give one third of my wealth to my wife because by default she is one of the heirs and she will get either quarter or one eighth of my possession depending if i have offsprings or not likewise i cannot give my father my mother my son because their all will inherit by default so i cannot give them a penny of the one-third the one-third has to be to someone who does not inherit me so if your nephew is not one of your heirs because if he's your paternal nephew and you don't have a father a mother a wife a children brothers he is the only one who will inherit everything so whether you write it or not he's by default gonna take everything else but if there are other heirs then you cannot write anything to him and allah knows best"
