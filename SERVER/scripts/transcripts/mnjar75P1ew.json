  "title": "Imam makes long dua for completing Quran in Taraweeh, can I stay to pray Witr with Imam for reward?",
  "transcript": "Abrar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, after finishing the recitation of the whole Quran in Tarawih prayer in Masjid, majority Masjid make a long congregational du'a for like 15 to 20 minutes before the witness prayer. Now the problem is that I am not supposed to be involved in such bid'ah and should come out of the place, but at the same time I have to complete my witness prayer with the Imam. Otherwise I will lose the reward of praying the whole night. So what should I do? There is no problem insha'Allah in praying behind them while resenting this bid'ah, this innovation. The du'a of Khatmal Quran is an innovation. And the types that are done at the end or the last day of Ramadan and the prolonging of du'a for 15-20 minutes, all of this is an innovation, not from the Sunnah, not from the way of the Salaf. But to gain the reward, as you've clearly stated, you have to pray with the Imam until he finishes. So you resent it, you hate it with your heart, but you continue until you conclude your night prayer with the Imam to gain the reward of the whole night, bi-idhnillahi azzawajal."
