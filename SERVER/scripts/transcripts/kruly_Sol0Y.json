  "transcript": "Questioner from UK Yes, you can pray behind him because this ignorant imbecile does not own the Masjid. The Masjid is the house of Allah. He has no authority on forcing people to pray as he wishes. Whether you're a Wahabi or you're a Hanafi or you're a Shafi'i or you're a Maliki, this is none of his, excuse my French, business. So, yes, pray in the Masjid. Whenever he comes and approaches you, just give him a smile, like a stupid smile, and don't reply to him. Don't argue with him. Don't speak to him except by nodding your head and let him be. Because he's like, with all due respect, a fly. You're not going to fight with a fly. You just do this and ignore it and it will go away. So, these people, whether you're in Kashmir or in Pakistan or in Bangladesh, they are ignorant imbeciles. And I say it with a loud voice because they have no authority on Muslims to practice whatever they want. Akhi, if I want to put my hands on my side or put them beneath my navel or put them on my chest, it's none of your business. So, who cares what they think or what they say? Just ignore them. Don't pay attention. Don't pick up a fight because it's not worth it. Just smile to them and let them go away. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
