  "transcript": "Sheikh, I am a college student. I have a lot of LGBT friends. Also, I am a press desk worker. How do I logically prove to them that homosexuality is totally wrong? First of all, when you encounter someone with the plague, or coronavirus, or AIDS, or herpes, you don't prove to them anything. You just run. Yes, because if they wanted to understand the ruling, they come to a Sheikh. But when they come to you, they want to brainwash you. They want to bring you with them. This is why I say, run."
