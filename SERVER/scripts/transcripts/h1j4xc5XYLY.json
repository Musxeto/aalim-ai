  "transcript": "fatima says can women wear perfumes and the answer is yes women can wear perfumes without any problem providing that none muharram men would not find her scent so if she is 24/7 sitting home she can wear as many perfumes as she wishes if she is going out but and making sure that none muharram would not find the smell of her perfumes this is okay"
