  "title": "Does reciting Ayatul Kursi & Last 2 Ayahs of surah Baqarah protect us from our Qareen",
  "transcript": "and the last two verses of surat al-baqarah protect us from our kareem as well kareem is an associate jin each individual has a kareem a companion of the jinn usually generally speaking if not all the time they are deviant non-muslims who whisper in our ears all the bad things so all these intrusive thoughts and the bad thoughts we get them from the kareem so zuhair says when i recite ayatul kursiy in the last two verses of surat al-baqarah that protect us from shaytan from the devils is the kareem included in my point of view no he's not included because he runs in your veins like blood and he's always on the move maybe it reduces his influence a bit but it does not eliminate it even the prophet eyes of salam had a qareen and when the companion said to him even you o prophet of allah is it even me however allah has aided me allah has helped me so that i would be protected from his evil this is one interpretation or allah has aided me that he became a muslim so he's not giving me any bad ideas or thoughts anymore either way the prophet was protected and he is the prophet so definitely uh in my opinion reciting ayato kursi and the last two verses of surat al-baqarah does not work with the qareen it works with all other devils and allah knows best you"
