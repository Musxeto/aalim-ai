  "title": "Partitions in Mosques? How to notify women if they can't see imam?  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "abdul kareem says concerning the partition in our messages separating the men from the women if the imam makes a mistake in prayer or goes into sujood during Quran recitations especially during taraweeh prayers what happens to the women because they don't see the mm well first of all I personally believe that this partition this partition between men and women is not justifiable the messages at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not have any partition though they could have erected curtains or the likes but they did not have it so we should not have it as well this is part of the area that Islam allows women and men to be in the same place though without any contact if the a man makes a mistake women cannot correct him or what they can do is clap men can speak out but women can't though Islam tells us that the worst raw of women is the first and the worst raw of men is the last so that islam segregates between them yet the issue of partition is an Islamic this is my own opinion because in such situations women are unable to see the rows of men and to follow them so like Abdel Karim is asking justifiably if the Imam was reciting the Quran which is an ayah of prostration and he says allahu akbar and he prostrates women who do not know the quran not necessarily non Arabs even arabs they don't even pay attention to what the imam is reciting and some of them do but they don't know that this is a position of prostration so they immediately say allahu akbar and they make Luke or after the mm is finished he says Allah ho Akbar now they are in a dilemma he should have said semi allahu liman hamidah some of them don't know what to do and may prostrate for salute some of them would raise their heads and continue standing which is the right thing to do because that procore that product that bowing is void it has no value so they stand up and still continue with the Imam in his recitation and this is what they're supposed to do and that is why I believe that such a partition a partition is not something that is recommended and Allah knows best"
