  "title": "Why will we be nervous on day of judgement when we will already know where we will go?",
  "transcript": "Waleed from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my question is regarding the Day of Judgment. So from what I understand after we're placed in the grave and we're asked the three questions, independent on if we answer correctly or incorrectly, we'll know our destination. So my question is, why is there nervousness on the Day of Judgment if everybody knows where they're going? Because this nervousness is caused by the horrific day. Even if you have confirmation that you will be inshallah in Jannah, this confirmation is not an assurance that you will not go to hell. Now remember, there are three questions. Who is your Lord? What is your religion? And who is this man who was sent to you? You answer it correctly, you will be resting in your grave. Now this doesn't mean that if you had done certain sins such as backbiting, not cleaning yourself well after urinating or answering the call of nature, etc., that you won't be punished in your grave. You will be. This does not mean that when you go on the Day of Judgment and held accountable for your sins, that you'll go straight ahead to Jannah. You will be punished for your sins. Maybe you will be admitted for hellfire for a year, for a thousand, for a million, until Allah wills it and you're purified from your sins, then you'll be admitted to Paradise. Either way, with all such assurances, you're still terrified because you don't know what your fate is going to be. Unlike those who will be among the 70,000, may Allah make me and you among them, and our viewers as well, who will not be held accountable and would not be tormented. They have no fear. They will go and be admitted to Paradise and all their sins would be erased and forgiven. That's a different story. The vast majority of the public, of the people, would be questioned in their graves. And regardless of how positive, well, if it's a negative answer, the stress is logical. What do they expect other than being thrown into hell? They have to be scared like crazy. But those who are given the green pass that inshallah they are in Paradise, they're still intimidated by the fact of their sins and of the horrific scenes of the Day of Judgment. And Allah knows best."
