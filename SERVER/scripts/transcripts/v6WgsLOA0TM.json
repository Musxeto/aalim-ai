  "transcript": "Alima from France. Assalamu Alaikum Sir. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Yes Sheikh, I'm very sorry, like recently when he told me to be talking to my father and I've been talking to him so unfortunately for me I was unable to tell him I don't have money to give him, so he has been shouting, he wants money, he wants money, he wants money. Because I was scared of so many things, I was scared that I would get in attack, to insult him again, so I decided to give him what he wants and he was very pleased with me, he prayed for me and everything, so now I don't have any money to eat, I don't have maybe like let me say €55 in my account to eat, because €10 I will pay insurance insurance for my for where I'm living. Okay Halima, is your father wealthy? Um he's a handicapped and I don't know if he's wealthy, I don't know what he's into, I know that he's into car dealers sometimes, I've already accompanied him to where he sells cars. Do your siblings have money? My brother he's here in France but he does not have any paper. But he has money at least like you or more? Exactly, but he has so many, he has some brothers that are very very rich and he has um he has so many wives and so many children, honestly sir. Okay first of all, this is a common mistake unfortunately that parents tend to not fear Allah and blackmail their children, especially those who are most vulnerable and in need. And they extort them from for money and they keep on insisting and threatening that they'll make dua and they will be angry and Allah will be angry with them. First of all, Allah says in the Qur'an, Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear. Which means that as a son, I'm responsible to give my parents money, providing number one, that they are in need. So if my parents are well off or they have their essential things and necessities, they're not in need, yet they demand money, they demand I give them monthly salary, I'm not obliged to obey them. Even if they're angry because they have enough, why would I give them? Just because Simon says, no. Giving them is related to their need, not to their demand, especially when they are well off. Condition number two, that I have what is sufficient for me and my immediate family, and my immediate family, wife and children, and that would be in excess. But if my father wants and I give it to you so you could give it to my siblings? They're not my responsibility, they're yours. So I will not give you anything. Why would I give you money when you're spending it to my stepmothers? I'm not responsible for them. I have to care for my needs, for my future, for my business, for my children, so I don't give him anything. Finally, why would I be the only one giving you when you have other children you can ask from? And especially if he's asking from a girl and leaving the boys who are earning and capable of working, that is unacceptable and you have to do not send him anything when it's harming you personally, even if he becomes mad at you."
