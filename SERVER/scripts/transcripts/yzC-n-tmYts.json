  "title": "Wearing the Niqab so tight where you can hardly see the eyes a bit extreme? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sajida from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. I learned that you're supposed to show as little of your eyes as possible when wearing niqab. I don't know what you're saying Sajida. Please speak a little bit clearly and slowly. I'm an old man. Okay, sorry. I learned that you're supposed to show as little of your eyes as possible when wearing niqab. So, I'm trying to do that, but my mom told me that I'm defeating the purpose of niqab because I had few Muslims, including a niqabi, who looked at me weirdly because you could only see a little bit of my eyes. Like the alims I know, girls that wear gloves, they don't wear their niqab like that. My dad told me when he went to Urba, he saw people wearing niqab like normally. And I want to wear the niqab the way the sahabi's did it, but I'm getting doubts that I'm being extreme at doing it wrong. So, do you have any advice on this? Jazakallah Khairun. Jazakallah. Sajida, be steadfast. Whenever you're abiding by the truth, by the Quran, by the sunnah, you'll have enemies. You will have critics. What you're doing is A-OK. 100% perfect. Those who look down at you among the quote unquote niqabis or among the quote unquote hijabis, they're envious. Because you're doing it so well, they're looking down at you and trying to put you down or pull you down. Put you down is a little bit too extreme. They're trying to make you feel inferior. The hijab that many women wear today, doing this, showing their eyebrows, showing their cheekbones, some of them showing to the tip of their nose. This is not niqab. Who are they joking about? They need braces to fix their teeth. That's why they're covering it. They have pimples in their cheek. That's why they're covering it. They're not wearing the hijab for the sake of Allah. Most likely. I'm not judging them. Who cares? I judge whomever I want. Sue me. So unfortunately, they're not abiding by the hijab. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, illustrated how the hijab should be done by only exposing one eye. And the niqab is to be worn so that you could see, not so that people could see you. So wearing it this tight. OK, people could see my eyes, but they can't see anything else. There's no fitna in that. When you do this and they see the eyebrows. People would say, Sheikh, it's bushy. You need to pluck your eyebrows. Well, I don't want to be among those who's cursed. This by itself is a form of adornment, of beautification. When they show this area from the temple. Again, this is not permissible to show. What are you doing? So don't listen to your mom in this regards. Don't listen to your father. Don't listen to these alima and the likes, because they're envious of you. You're on the right track, my daughter. Keep being steadfast and inshallah, they will follow you with the grace of Allah. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And by the will of Allah, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, by the will of Allah."
