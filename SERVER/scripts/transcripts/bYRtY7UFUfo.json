  "title": "Joining the imam after missing a rakat or more",
  "transcript": "if I joined the Imam and I missed Erica or more the format of prayer would be different so if the Imam is in the third raka or let's assume I join him in his second raka and I this is my first raka he sits after his second rocker which is my first so how can I do it should I stand up whenever you join the Imam you must and you're obliged to follow him in every single move he makes with the exception of the salaam because when he offers salaam he concludes your his prayer you are obliged to continue and complete yours so if I joined the Imam in his fourth raka this is my first he sits for the Shahada final I sit he gives salaam I stand up for my second and then I sit in the second the third I stand up the fourth I sit for the final to shout and this is it so I hope this answers your question"
