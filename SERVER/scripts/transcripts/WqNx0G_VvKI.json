  "title": "Water drops that remain in private part from Istinja - najis? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "finally zainab says I heard you say anything that comes out of the private party's nudges except the continuous discharge but when a woman does his Ninja that is washing the private part after answering the call of nature a few drops of water remain inside if these drops of water touch her underwear is it nudges first of all such a scenario is Extreme nobody allows water to enter their private parts whether male or female this is not logical because what we are supposed to do is to wash the external area not to go inside and hence what you're asking about is not normal so this is point one point two we usually advise people to follow a process that would eliminate such Whispers And doubts from creeping into their minds and that is after you urinate and there is nothing coming out and you see no dripping nothing at all is coming out by itself you simply watch the external area and sprinkle water in the inside of your underwear so it's a bit damp don't dry it off then you can stand and move on if you feel something came out you tell yourself that this is from what I've sprinkled on my underwear and it's not the drops coming from inside your private part or anything else the sprinkling process is authentic Sunnah and the way of the Prophet Allah so he did it and we should follow suit and this would eliminate totally any kind of future Whispers with the grace of Allah"
