  "title": "Security deposit to landlord VS  Paying large deposit & rent for less money, Riba? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "so when sometimes when you rent a apartment they ask for this thing called a deposit and it's like some money which you put in the deposit and then sometimes like after your contract is over um they give the money back though we still pay the rent so i'm not sure whether this considered riba or not this deposit is it something logical or a huge amount of money uh i don't know it depends like they say it's a security deposit or something okay i will answer inshallah mira from georgia she says they ask us for a deposit and i specifically asked her is the deposit normal so if i'm paying rent a 12 000 a year 1 000 a month for my apartment before getting in before moving in they asked me for 500 or 1000 or 2 000 as a deposit which will be returned to me after i even leave the the apartment after they check whether i had left some damages or not this is halal there's no river in that this is a deposit for security what's happening in other countries like india and pakistan instead of paying twelve thousand dollars a year they come and give fifty thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars as a deposit whoa that's a huge amount of money and then they offer me to rent for five dollars a month which is peanuts so this is actual riba because the hundred thousand dollars deposit is an actual loan and the interest over that loan is me staying in their apartment for literally free and when i check out three four years later they give me the hundred thousand back which is my loan to them this is prohibited and allah knows best you"
