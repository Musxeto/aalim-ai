  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Saudi Arabia my question is \nregarding zakaat okay so we okay being 15 Muslim   people invested our money in uh building a Muslim \nSchool in India right its a Muslim school so our   money is primarily invested in buying the school \nland and the new building for an indefinite period   and the school management will we will will get a \nwill give us the equal profit based on the profit. how or why in case the lasting period \nfor this amount is five years however   if in in 5 years after 5 years we change \nour mind they will return back the money   based on the current market value \nso my question is is zakat needs   to be payed for this principle sum for \nwhat we invested in this school sheikh did you invest in this school expecting \nthat it will have revenue or it's a gift   that you are giving to the \ncommunity for the Muslims   no it's expecting we will get a revenue okay if \nthis is the case now from day one if you invested   100 000 rupees the hundred thousand rupees is \nbeing invested in the school so the total of the   15 people whatever they contributed and chipped \nin this is a company that can be evaluated and   estimated from day one so from day one what is \nthe capital you multiply a hundred thousand by   15 it's 1.5 million whatever let's uh presume \nit's 2 million rupees 20 million rupees whatever   since day one of first of Muharram or first \nof Safar this company has started a year later   we come and see where is the investment now so a \nyear later when the zakaat is due we evaluate they   say well we don't have a school yet it's still \nbeing under process process we're building it we   bought the land we did this we did that how much \ndo you value and evaluate the property at hand   a year later they say no now it's maybe 50 000 \nrupees why because this is what the cost or they   might say oh no now it is 5 million because \nthe value of the land went up so you give   zakat on your share according your percentage \nin the capital you give 2.5 percent accordingly   a year later we have a property and we have \nbuildings now the building itself is not for sale   the building accommodates the students and \nthe administration and the playground Etc   we have buses to transport uh the students in \nand out we have furniture all of these things   are not zakatable so my money that I invested in \nit there's no zakat on it because this is property   not for sale this is being granted this is a \nservice provider what do we give zakat on on the   revenue you're not selling anything so whatever \nwe collect from the students and we collect a lump   sum of this much money and at the end of the year \nwe distribute dividends and profit this is what   you give zakat over not your capital because \nthe capital is not something you're selling   and it's not crops coming from the ground and \nit's not livestocks and it's not gold and silver   it is invested in rental or service \nproviding Etc so the zakat would be on your   um profit and Allah knows best if you were to \nsell that's a different issue all together and   it has to go through the cycle of threshold \nand the passing of one full lunar year foreign"
