  "title": "Can we pray 2 Friday prayers in the same masjid?",
  "transcript": "[Music] says is it permissible to pray juma twice in one masjid this is a frequently asked question especially for people in europe and in uk i've seen so many people not only ask this but do this and jumoa is a weekly sermon that cannot be repeated unlike the five daily prayers if you missed the congregation you can make a second congregation but in jumuah the masjid itself the essence of friday speech and prayer is that it's to be done only once okay what about if the message is small even if the masjid is small the people must pray outside and if it is not possible for them to pray outside they should gather in a park or in a school and perform another juma for themselves not to perform a second juma and this is the fatwa of the major scholars of saudi arabia and the permanent committee of ifta and other supreme councils"
