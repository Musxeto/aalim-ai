  "transcript": "last time I asked you one question regarding one boy married without the consent of the parents as parents claimed that the girl was moving around with the boy their son was probably nearly 45 years and coming to the house in the absence of all the family members nobody was there you know so they claimed that we don't want such a girl to marry to our son so even if you should hear a bluff he should have been taunted they asked him several times that the if there is any girl he said no no I don't have I don't not of me he lied he lied he lied and then he got married and then informal but then they got the proof that he took the pictures and all that in the laptop of their elder son and all these things you know what to do what shall I say about it okay Abu Yussef says about an old question of his that a boy married a girl and his pen against his parents will and his parents are complaining that he had an affair with her this is history now the boy is married you as parents are asked the simple question is the girl and your son happy in their marriage is the girl righteous and practicing Muslim abiding by the hijab trying her level best to practice Islam regardless of her past who among us does not have a past except me of course everybody has a past Subhan Allah but Allah graced us through concealing our past our shortcomings our previous sins so when you start digging up things and most likely these parents are not telling the truth how did they come to know that their son was having affair with her oh he brought her to the house when we were not present he did this he did that Allah who Adam whether this is true or not but this is beside the point are you willing to break a valley marriage of a Muslim woman just because of speculations or because a grudge you are unable to get over that no this is not permissible and you should be more considerate"
