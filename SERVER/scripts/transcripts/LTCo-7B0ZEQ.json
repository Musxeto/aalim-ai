  "transcript": "One last thing, Sheikh, before we finish. Promise? Promise. I promise now, this time, because this is very important. Okay. Some people accuse that when Muslim exit from his religion as a murtadin, it must be killed. Can you please clarify this, Sheikh? Show me one country in the world that implements this law of apostasy. Apostasy. So let's assume there are three or four countries in Indonesia. Is this law applicable? No. Okay. How many people exit Islam? Let's say a few million. But this is not true? Yeah. Not even hundreds of thousands? Yes. Anyone who knows Islam and would leave Islam, though there is no capital punishment for it, there is no imprisonment, because it is something natural. Those who accept Islam never leave it. And those who claim to be ex-Muslims and they are very vocal or loud, these are like dogs that bark. Only bark and no bite. Okay. The law is there. Anyone who accepts Islam wholeheartedly and then rejects it and commits an act of apostasy, in Islamic Sharia law, he is given an ultimatum to repent and to retract his actions and what he said. In certain period. Yeah. If he refuses, then the Muslim judge rules with other two judges that they spoke to him, that they gave him a chance, and he refused. And they take this verdict to the Muslim ruler, and the Muslim ruler offers the ruling whether to be executed or not. I see."
