  "transcript": "Faisal from Ethiopia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam to Allah. How are you? I'm fine Alhamdulillah. What about yourself? My question is, my daughter asked me that when a person passed away, he knows whether he entered heaven or not. So why do people fear on the day of Judgment Day because they already know that they entered heaven? I don't understand a single word of what you're saying Faisal. Your daughter asked you about something and then it's all gibberish. Please make it clear to me. When a person passed away or dead, he knows whether he entered heaven or not. No, no, no, no, no. When a person dies, he doesn't know whether he's going to hell or to heaven. Unless he is a Kafir. Kafirs know for sure and certainty that they will end up in hell for eternity. But they're still hopeful. They're still wishful that okay, all this torment, all this punishment in the grave is going to end and maybe we have a chance. But they know that this is where they're headed because they did not anticipate this. Believers are hopeful, but they don't know whether they will be thrown in hell for a number of years to cleanse them from their sins or not. But they're hopeful that Alhamdulillah, we've seen goodness. We've answered the three questions. You know, each and every one of us will be asked three questions in the grave. If they answer it correctly, then this is inshallah their chance of being in paradise. Does this answer your question? Okay, I think we've lost Faisal, but I hope we managed to answer his question. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
