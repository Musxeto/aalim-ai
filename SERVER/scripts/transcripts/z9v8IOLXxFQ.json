  "transcript": "a from India I have a question what is the meaning of arrogance K that I am better I'm certainly better or I might be better I hear many scholars say that when you meet someone old say to yourself that he has done more good than you so he's better than you okay that's true arrogance or k as defined by the prophet is meaning rejecting the truth and meaning looking down at people as humans we have this tendency that whenever we see others we compare ourselves to them putting ourselves in a superior place and in a better place so okay he's shorter than me he's more fat he's um he has less money he's car is of an older model he's this he's that he speaks funny compared to me this is arrogance and this is why the salaf say when you see someone who's older than you always look down upon yourself instead of looking down upon him and say Subhan Allah he's older than me he has so many many Good Deeds more than I have have and when you see someone who's younger than you look down upon yourself and say Subhan Allah he's way younger than me he made less sins than the sins that I had made and this way you keep yourself humble some of the companions like Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him when he was the ruler of the city he used to carry his own goods from the market and say make way for the Amir make way for the Amir which is unheard of usually the Amir the ruler has someone to carry his things for him but when he announces this while carrying his own stuff is to Humble himself by the people looking at what kind of an Amir is this who's doing his own errands by himself this is part of humbling yourself and Allah Knows Best"
