  "transcript": "Suham from U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So like um you know the trust on the eye after waking up? Yes. Yeah so like in wudu if I like wash my face like it like expands like 1.5 percent bigger or like two times bigger. So like is my wudu valid or do I have to like rub it off? The wudu is valid according to the most authentic opinion due to the fact that this is negligible and normal people would usually wash it off but if you did not notice it and you simply washed your face this is valid inshallah."
