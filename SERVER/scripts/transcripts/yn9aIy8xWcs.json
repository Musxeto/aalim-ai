  "transcript": "Ziyad from Bangladesh Wa'alaikumussalam Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam So while praying in congregation and Imam goes to the Ruku and I go to the Ruku after sometimes, like a few moments that the Imam got to the Ruku but when he says Sallallahu Alaihe Wasallam I might not have said the Tasbeeh, Subhana Rabbia Al Azeem, one time Ziyad, Ziyad, Ziyad Ziyad, Ziyad, Ziyad How long you've been Muslim? How long you've been praying? No, no, no Praying normally How long, Yani? 19 years Ok, you do the math 19 times 360 days times 5 prayers a day minimum, and we get like 20-30 thousand prayers Now my question to you, what's your name? Ziyad How long did it take you to say your name? One second Correct? Yes How many times do you repeat your name a month? 100 times No, no, no, not even 5 times You don't get people coming to you coming to you every now, what's your name? What's your name? No, maybe 5 times 10 times a month Yet, you had not made a mistake and you said your name in a fraction of a second Now you give me the logic here Is it possible that 30 thousand prayers the same Adhkar and you still make problems Brother, Shaytan is messing up with your head You know the Adhkar Subhanarabbia Al-Azeem Subhanarabbia more than your name But you are the one who is opening the door for Shaytan and inviting him Please come in, and mess up with my head Leave this nonsense once, and go to Ruku' to answer your question, if you were in the Ruku' at the same time as the Imam was in the Ruku' even if you did not say Subhanarabbia Al-Azeem just being in the Ruku' position is sufficient Once he says you are able to say Subhanarabbia Al-Azeem and you rise up, your prayer is valid"
