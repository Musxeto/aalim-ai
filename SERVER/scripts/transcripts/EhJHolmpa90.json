  "transcript": "bassett says can we give clothes groceries etc as zakat instead of cash this is happening in so many countries and places and communities i have money of zakat and instead of going to the poor and giving them money in their hand shaytaan comes to me and says no no no if you give them cash they're going to spend it in over things that are not necessary so i demand to choose for them and this is wrong and this is not permissible in verse 60 the eight categories of the recipients of zakat what's the difference said scholars of arabic language says ah there is a big difference li means that you have to give it to them in their hands and they do with it whatever they want while fee means that if you pay it on their behalf that would do so the four first four category the quran is these you can give it to them in cash or you must give it to them in cash they do with it whatever they want the other four categories in freeing slaves or captive those are in debt and those who fight in the cause of allah and those who are um stranded while traveling and they are broken they lost their documents they don't have money those four last categories i can give on their behalf so if i know someone who's in debt and someone wants a hundred thousand dollars from him if i give him that hundred thousand dollars in hand he may not pay off the debt and end up in jail so if i go directly to the debtor or if i go to the landlord who's about to kick him out because he's not paying the rent and i pay it off for him that does the job he doesn't have the right to say the zakat should have been given to me in cash no no the poor and the needy in the beginning i have to give it to them in cash therefore what people do by buying groceries and clothes and things and they go and give it to the poor as the cat is not permissible when does it become permissible if i as a poor come to you and say listen i don't have food in the house so if you have zakat my friend can you please buy me 40 kilos of rice and 2 gallons of cooking oil and some pasta and some sugar and some salt and some olive oil and some this and that so that i can store it in my home he's authorizing me the poor is offering rising me to buy on his behalf in this case this is permissible and allah knows best you"
