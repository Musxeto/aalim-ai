  "transcript": "risa says what is the ruling for someone at the starting of Ramadan she was seriously sick and she happened to die in the middle of Ramadan how are you going to compensate that on behalf of the dead person first of all if a person falls sick and misses days of Ramadan and did not recover or get a chance to make up any of these days he continued to be 6 for 6 months for a year and then he died there is no expiration for that we don't have to feed anything we don't have to make up for these mistakes second situation is if a person falls sick and misses days of Ramadan but the scholars the doctors say that such an illness cannot be recovered or cured and this person will remain sick unable to fast until the day he dies whether it's a year five or ten years from now in this case we have to feed one poor person for every day mist so if the man dies after Ramadan by 3-4 months and he did not fast and he did not feel we will feed on his behalf third situation is if a person falls sick skips days of Ramadan and lives three or four months afterwards able to make up but he knows that he has the time limit till the following Ramadan so he's postponing making it up because he has the right to do so and all of a sudden he dies this situation is where his ears his relatives his wife his children his brothers those who are relegated to him may make up for those missed days whether one of them carries them all or 10 of them each carries a day or a day or two days etc there is no problem in that insha'Allah I hope this answers your question"
