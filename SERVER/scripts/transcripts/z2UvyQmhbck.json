  "title": "Can we recite Surah Mulk or Yaseen at the Graveyard & can women visit Graveyards? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "habiba from saudi um my sister who recently husband died and her friend as well that lost her husband as well both of them visit the graveyard while they are there her friend says that we have to recycle the assist and who i woke and my sister said if she doesn't know whether this is right for her to do that because she says he'll be blessing them grace okay first of all may allah azzawajal have mercy on both of their husbands second of all it is an issue of dispute whether women are entitled or permitted to visit cemeteries and graveyards and the opinion that i follow and this is the opinion of sheikh bin bazen and the major scholars of uh saudi arabia is that it is prohibited because the prophet alaihis aslam cursed those who frequently visit the graveyards and it's an issue of dispute but this is what i am inclined to so they must not go and visit the graveyards thirdly and finally when people go and visit a graveyard it is totally prohibited for them to recite the quran whether it is or baccarat or fatiha which is the most commonly recited whenever a disease is mentioned so uncle so-and-so died no let's recite the fatih alhamdulillah and they spit here and there what are you doing he said no this is part of the culture whenever a deceased person is dead we recite fatiha and whenever someone is getting married we recite fatiha as if getting married and dying is the same thing it might be but anyhow this is not our topic so this is an innovation what to do when visiting a grave you make dua assalamu alaikum and but not to recite the quran and allah knows best you"
