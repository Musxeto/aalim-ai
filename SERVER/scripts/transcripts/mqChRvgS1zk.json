  "transcript": "uh nafis from bangladesh i wanted to make a follow-up question regarding to regarding the one who realized that his garment may be showing the contour of his aura or the garment is a little too thin but ignores it and continues to pray the whole day in the state his garment most likely or actually didn't show that much contour rather sometimes depending on his position only a small bump was seen sorry for the language are his prayers still did you hear the question so you're not asking about a garment that is see-through rather a garment that the physique of the individual and you're referring to a man here specifically when he prostrates for example may show the size or the shape of his aura am i correct in my assumption yes a little bit what do you mean a little bit i mean it shows a little bit what is the little bit that is missing no uh sorry i mean like uh only a small bump that's what that's what i mean just a small one so yes okay if this is the case if this is the case most men when they wear trousers and these trousers may not hide some of the curves of their bodies now does this mean that their aura has been revealed and that they cannot pray in such trousers the answer is no the prayer is valid what about a woman maybe a woman is wearing abbaya but some of her curves may also appear and this is something that is inevitable we can't just put a barrel on top of her and say so that we don't see any of your curves this is something that's natural and such would not be impacting the validity of the prayer what would be impacting the validity of a prayer for a woman for example to wear real tight clothes that show her curves and bone structure in salat and would reveal and would be tempting and seductive that would invalidate her salat as for men due to the necessity and the difficulty and that they're not obliged to wear the hijab like women do it's a bit more lenient and allah azza knows best you"
