  "transcript": "of the previous scholars. So ever since I was a kid I heard that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala is Noor. So whenever I try to pray or do anything there is this image of Noor that comes to my mind that I know that that is not Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala but it just steps to my mind and even if I'm trying to pray it's just there. So am I sinful for that? What am I supposed to do in this situation? Muhammad is it getting you closer to Allah when you think like that? No Sheikh. Then this is shaitan. So what do you expect shaitan to do? He will infuse this feeling, he will exaggerate it, he will inflate it, until it destroys your whole Islam. And you will find that skipping Islam is the easiest thing to do. And this is what shaitan wants. So ignore it, block it, and move on with your life."
