  "title": "Asked a Restaurant in a nonmuslim country to lower the music, & they did, - can I eat there? assim",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from Sweden okay so this question here so this restaurant goes right and they play music and I follow you advice that I should demand them to turn them off right to not turn off the music now I know that you said in another video that I searched for that it is a difference between hearing and listening to music but still I saw them turn her off and I live in a careful country at alhamdulillah they turn it off like three four times but this last time uh they didn't want to turn off by asking can you please lower it and reduce it and they did and then I went back a second time and a third time and told them please lower it even more so at this point they lowered the music so much that I cannot hear anything because people are talking in the restaurant and it's so low so I'm not being affected by it so is it okay for me inshallah in my heart as well because I don't want to hear that so but it was so low that I did not hear it and the people were talking so I cannot hear anything so is the queen shall not to be an ether yes this is permissible inshallah and I pray to Allah azzawajal that he increases in your Iman and that he makes you steadfast on Islam what you're doing is something that is great just to be willing to live like a Muslim in a cafe country and ask them diplomatically with good morals and a nice way to do something that goes against your religion and it goes against your own preference there's nothing wrong in that there's nothing Haram in that the problem is when we have Muslims in Muslim countries refraining from doing such things they're intimidated they're hesitant they're ashamed how do we go to the authorities of the restaurant or of the hotel and ask them to lower the music no no this is not civil what how would they perceive us and look at us subhanallah these people don't fear Allah they're doing what they're doing because they're following their devils and satans their whims and desires and they're not ashamed of it and you are ashamed of expressing what is halal and what is Haram the least you could do is not go there but you don't have the guts to be proud of your religion and stand up for yourself if someone started smoking wouldn't you go and say okay it's an unsmoking area or would you be ashamed from talking why is it that when it comes to the religion of Allah we are always the backbenchers we're always at the back stage afraid and feeling that we're the opposition and we are going and swimming against the tide this is not the right way of doing it so I pray to Allah that he keeps you steadfast on Islam"
