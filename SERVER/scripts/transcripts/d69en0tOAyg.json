  "transcript": "Ibrahima from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu May Allah preserve you Sheikh And you as well Sheikh, my question is related to marriage Actually, it's been more than a year that I'm looking for a wife I tried to put some filters out to at least try to get the best results But until now, unfortunately, at least here in the Salafi community It's really complicated because I put just some few filters Like no music, no TV, like no free mixing, full hijab And the last one is like not posting yourself and stuff like that But Sheikh, it's been more than a year, I couldn't find until now a possible matchup Because even now when I went to even the biggest shuyukhs here They would just tell me, okay make dua It's very difficult to find a woman like this Even me, I don't have some kind of woman like that It's really complicated I don't know what kind of advice you can give me in that situation Akhi, this is totally not true I do a lot of counseling sessions And I meet a lot of practicing sisters from Africa Who are looking for real practicing men Who do not want free mixing, who do not want music Who do not want them to expose themselves And who do not want their wives to work Rather they want to be the providers, the men, the guardians They want a stay home wife, a lot Unfortunately I don't involve myself in matchmaking Otherwise I would have been more than happy to guide you to But I don't keep records of this But I have seen a lot So maybe you're not looking in the right place And you need to maybe check with the proper Islamic matrimonial sites That have good conditions of not free mixing, not asking Not contacting directly the potential candidate And you will inshallah be successful in finding what you want And Allah knows best"
