  "transcript": "cd from germany i'm chef what's already in going to a restaurant in a christian country like mcdonald's burger king kfc and a steakhouse and so that also serves pork like bacon and we don't know if other fruits like chicken beef that also has utensils of the pork then is it harm to eat there for germany says if a restaurant serves halal and haram food so like most restaurants they sell halal food and they also sell pork and we don't know if the utensils are contaminated mixed um they use the same fryers etc what to do not to eat you must not eat in such places if you for example i'm not endorsing this chain but i remember when i was in johannesburg in south africa i dined in a restaurant called the butcher and it's a steakhouse beautiful meat they told me that the owner is a christian but he insists on slaughtering all the cows for his meat because it's more tender and tasty and they don't serve pork so i used to go there breakfast lunch and dinner the whole stay this is okay there's no problem with that but when they have pork it's too risky avoid that inshallah"
