  "transcript": "my question is if I want to know to know two opinions from two trustworthy Scholars for example one from and one from Sheikh binbad can I follow the easier opinion this issue ahmatullah we have discussed discussed so many times and we said that a Layman should not cherry pick what you're asking about is cherry picking says no Sheikh bimbas says yes it's more lenient for me to take the yes decision I followed on a different issue says no and check me says yes okay I'm gonna choose ebene this is cherry picking a Layman someone who doesn't have knowledge and has no means of researching and finding the truth or what's closest to the truth is not permitted to cherry pick rather you have to follow one scholar throughout your life so you stick with in everything he says even if this is not the easiest opinion for you and Allah Knows Best"
