  "transcript": "Bilal from Australia so I know for a couple that were in a wrong relationship Once Upon a Time and they committed hard on acts right but they never actually committed the full Act of Xena which could cause the lady to become pregnant so after some time away from each other they knew I want to get married would they have to repent first for the marriage to be valid the scholars say that a marriage contract between two who were fornicating and did not repent is invalid and fornication is major and minor the one that invalidates a marriage contract without repentance is the major one which requires penetration so if these couple did everything but did not go to third base and they acknowledge that they're sinful they can get married because they did not do the major thing yes they're sinful and they're punishable and they're accountable but if they get married their marriage contract is not affected by their sin and their marriage contract is valid insha Allah foreign"
