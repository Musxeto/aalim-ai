  "title": "The widespread belief that it is makrooh to get married in Muharram and Ramadan",
  "transcript": "a boma roof says that there are sects and cults that do not marry in Ramadan and in the month of Muharram these are innovators these people are ignorant because nothing is Haram except what Allah has made Haram and thinking bad about Muharram just simply because Al Hussein may Allah be pleased with him was assassinated in it doesn't mean anything and as Muslims we have no negative feelings towards the month of Muharram on the contrary the 10th of Muharram is a day that we as Muslims celebrate because Musa who is better than Al Hassan and in Hussein without any doubt he's one of the five strong-willed messengers of Allah anyone thinking that it hasn't her st. or any of the Companions are better than Musa he's a kafir there's no doubt in that so Musa himself may Allah have may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him was saved alongside with his people from Pharoah and Allah made Pharaoh and his soldiers drown in the sea so we celebrate this day by fasting it as the Prophet had fasted yet Salah solemn and recommended us to do so so what these people are doing is totally baseless and an innovation"
