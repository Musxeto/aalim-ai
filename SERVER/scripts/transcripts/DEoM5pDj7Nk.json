  "transcript": "from canada says what's the ruling on playing chess chess is an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars say that it is totally prohibited and they narrate the hadith that ali may always please with him passed by people praying chess and he said what are these idols that you are worshiping this is being quoted from the quran for those who were worshiping idols and not playing a game so a lot of scholars said that this is haram on the basis that it wastes time and that it is not befitting of a muslim to engage in such games and there is a probability that one would miss the salat and the probability of gambling and with all due respect i believe that all of these justifications are not accurate everything nowadays can waste your time so what's your ruling on screening your whatsapp or facebook or twitter what's the ruling on taking a ride for six for two three hours with the with the guys with the boys hanging out at cafes drinking coffee etc it's halal but how do i define whether it's wasting time or not if i'm not playing around and being distracted from my obligations i'm doing my prayer on time i'm doing my obligations towards my parents my wife my children my work my studies and i have free time and i'd like to waste it and re entertain myself and halal means what's wrong in that my prayer is done in the masjid no problem there's no gambling there's no swearing so some scholars said that it is haram other scholars said that it is totally permissible because it makes you think it makes you strategize and it is something beneficial for your brain providing that the conditions are fulfilled your prayer is done on time there's no gambling there's no swearing there's no cheating you're not uh being distracted from your obligations and the night when you play chess i think it's on the format of a horse and this is a statue it has to be covered because this is totally haram to have this is a statue a 3d statue of a horse so you break the head of the night or put a helmet on it whatever it's a night after all do something and i think there's nothing wrong in doing it for half an hour an hour a day for those who are focused on doing their obligations and need time out to entertain themselves"
