  "title": "Can we buy software from 3rd party websites that offer it cheaper? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, there are some websites which sell software products for such a cheap price compared to the original price of the product and they can easily be found on Google. For example, buying Windows directly from Microsoft would cost around $150 and those cheap websites sometimes sell the same product for a much lower price. There is also another possibility that maybe they are cheating or stealing but I have no firm evidence regarding this. It's just my assumptions on how those cheap websites work. So Sheikh, my question is, is it fine to buy products from them as long as we don't have clear evidence that they are stealing or doing something illegal? there is no problem in buying it and using it. But once you know that it was hacked or stolen, you cannot use that and Allah knows best."
