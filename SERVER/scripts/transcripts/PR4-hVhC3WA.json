  "transcript": "Fitnah. The word has been mentioned in the Quran and in the Sunnah and the scholars have talked about it for so many times throughout time. What is Fitnah? And the Prophet says Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, ìTawwadhu Billahi Minal Fitan Ma Zahara Minha Wa Ma Batanî Seek refuge in Allah from Fitnah, from trials and tribulations that is both visible and hidden. So what is Fitnah? Fitnah is trial, testing, tribulation. The word is often used to describe tests in which something disliked is eliminated, we try to get out of it. Later, it was also often used in the sense of, and this is used in the Quran and Sunnah, sin, kufr, shirk. Fitnah means all these words. Fighting, burning, when you torture someone through burning, this is Fitnah. As in Surah Al-Buruj, Fitnah here means they burnt them in trenches. And removing and diverting, all of this is Fitnah. So Fitnah has a very broad meaning. Shirk and kufr is Fitnah. And the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam asked us to seek refuge in Allah from Fitnah in general."
