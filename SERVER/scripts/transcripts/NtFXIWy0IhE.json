  "transcript": "so what about other amphibious animals such as frogs for example well frogs is not an issue of being a sea creature or an amphibious uh creature there is a specific ruling for that because the prophet alaihis salat islam prohibited they're killing and whatever the prophet alaihis hassan prohibits killing then it becomes haram to eat and consume a man came to the prophet that is salaam and he was a doctor so he said the prophet of allah we use frog meat in our medication so the prophet denied him and prohibited him from killing frogs and in another narration the prophet alaihis salatu said that i don't know what you call the sound of frogs but the sound of the frogs is this be it's praising allah it's glorifying allah azzawajal so the prophet prohibited killing it adding salah to west salem"
