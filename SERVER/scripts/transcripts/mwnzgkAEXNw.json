  "transcript": "Adrien from Serbia Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam If someone had urine on their hand and the urine dried up, will the impurity spread? For example, if he touches his phone or door handle, will the impurity spread or it would only spread if his hand gets wet? Adrien, Adrien, tell me, tell me, who would do this? If you don't know, how would I know? These questions come often. And those who are asking such a question, either have OCD. So they, due to the OCD, think that their hands are soiled with urine. When we ask them a straightforward question, do you have urine on your hand, they say, I don't know, I might have, I may, I think, I feel. All of these are doubts, throw them in the dustbin and move on. So people with OCD, we say to them, if you're not certain, then your hand is pure. But if you're doubtful, you tell me, who in his right mind would go out of the toilet with urine on his hand and go around touching things, whether the urine is dry or wet? And who in his right mind would have urine on his hand and say, what are you doing? I'm drying my urine. Why? So that it would become dry and I can touch things with it. Duh. Why not wash it? If I wash it, how would I ask the Sheikh? I need to have a scenario so that I would ask the Sheikh. So with all due respect, this question needs to have a real background. But if the najasa is dry and it cannot be transferred unless it comes in contact with a wet surface, and Allah knows best."
