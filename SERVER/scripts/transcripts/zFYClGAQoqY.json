  "transcript": "first of all regarding the hijab the sister is asking about the different types of hijab a woman should wear because we have the hijab then we have the digital Bab which is mentioned in the Quran then some say that him are as worn in Egypt and elsewhere which is just the head cover but it extends sometimes to the way sometimes Sudanese one head cover or is it the jilbab that goes from top to the feet or is it the abaya or do we have to wear a gown underneath or this or that don't get into technicalities what is the essence of hijab it is both physically and mentally what do you mean by mentally this is the first time I hear something that is related to mental job well I see nowadays in Nigeria elsewhere where women cover up from head to toe which is good but she's so loud she's so vocal you can hear her laughter from the end of the aisle she cracks jokes and she mixes with men though she's covered this is not hijab hijab is not only a dress code but in addition it is the way that a woman treats and deals with the opposite gender and this is why allah azza wajal address the mothers are the believers and the addresses for the all women of muslims that if you speak then do not soft in your voice sure my voice is soft by nature there is a difference between speaking in a feminine voice that lures men and you know what I mean or by straightforward what's the ruling on this what's the ruling on this is accepted but when you say uh what's ruling on this Shea and the ship is melting like butter what are you doing this is softening the voices it is not Haddad we see this in the souk in the market when a woman wants to buy something and she addresses the salesman in a soft voice to make a discount or please or do this this is Haram you should be straightforward so this is what is meant by hijab being physical and mental physical hijab is simple customs vary from country to country so I would not ask women to wear the black abaya of Saudi women because this may not fit in Europe or in America or in Nigeria Allah knows but there are characteristics of the hijab that a woman should adhere to it shouldn't be tight and I've seen a lot of women here in Nigeria wearing the sort of in Arabic call it ball - it's it's like a raincoat but it it's tight at the waist so it's exposing her shoulders her chest and the size of her waist this is closer to a dress rather than a jilbab or a coat or jacket whatever you can call it it has to be loose ample that does not expose her bone structure and curves because this is what draws men's attention it must not be see-through so yes it can be loose but some women wear something that you can see what's underneath of that this is not permissible it must not imitate men and it must not be the dress code of disbelieving women and it should not be a source of attraction by itself so imagine a woman comes out in a black chill bap very good very nice but it has for Sachi or Armani logo this big on her back whatever she goes people will look at her maybe she's wearing a loose and not transparent Abhaya but it is pink or is like really red no this is not applicable or acceptable it has it must not be fitna by itself and so on so don't limit yourself to what our sisters in Egypt are wearing which is Hammad which is very good because they were the the raincoat or the black ball to what we call it but they're in we're on top of it the Hammar which covers all of their head their shoulders and it goes down to their knees or to their waist which is very much' Allah good but you don't have to limit yourself in this you should look into the characteristics of the Islamic a implemented according to your culture providing it's not eye catching providing it your normal and it fits that insha'Allah"
