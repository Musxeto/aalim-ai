  "title": "Is praying only 1 rakat Witr every alternate day Bid'ah? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Noor from Malaysia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I tried to pray one Raka'at Witr after Isha, but I prayed every alternate days. Is this permissible or this has become an innovation because I said it every alternate days? Noor, what is the what's the ruling on praying Witr, one Raka'at? What is the ruling? It's not obligatory. It's not obligatory. So if you make it once in a lifetime, this is permissible. You're losing a lot of reward for not praying Witr every night. If you make it once a week, if you make it one in every two days or three days, it's the same thing. There is no bid'ah or innovation in it until you believe that this is Sunnah. Until you believe this is better for my reward than doing it every day, for example, then it becomes a bid'ah. But as long as you don't have any conviction, rather you're praying it according to your schedule or to your ability or maybe according to your laziness. There is no problem in that. Allah knows best."
