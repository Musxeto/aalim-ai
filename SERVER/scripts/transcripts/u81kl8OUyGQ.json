  "transcript": "I received an interview for a job, but again the job, it's not likely I'm going to pick up the job because it's likely not going to pay as much as I currently earn. However, I actually intend going for the interview in another city where they're going to pay for my flight and my lodging. So my question is, I actually intend going to that city even before the interview came up, but my question is, can I just go, you know, for the purpose of using a bad, I mean a stone to kill two birds, even though I know in my mind it may not likely to pay as much as I earn now. Is that okay? I don't understand your question. Are you telling me that the company offering you a position, they're giving you lodging and air freight to come and have the interview? Yes, yes. And you don't want, and you're not interested in the job? It's not likely that they're going to pay as much as I earn now. So I'm saying, can I go to the interview since I actually wanted to visit that city too for something personal? No problem. Can I just go there? No, no problem. As long as they're offering, maybe you'll try to negotiate a better pay and they may agree and may not agree. No problem in utilizing what they're offering, Inshallah."
