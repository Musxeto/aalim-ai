  "title": "Is Understanding the Quran only the Scholarsâ€™ Job? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "many Muslims consider that it's only an Alim or a scholar who can interpret the Quran and recite the Quran to them is this a correct um understanding Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 54 no less than four times it says in the same Surah Surah Kamar CH 54 verse number 17 verse number 22 verse number 32 as well as we have made the Quran easy for you to remember and understand then which of you shall not receive admonish so here the Quran says that it is easy for you to understand and some people say it's only meant for the scholar so there's a contradiction will you believe in them or will you believe in Allah subhana wa tala and Allah says in the Quran in Surah hij chapter number 15 verse number one Al if Lam these are the ayats of the Revelation which make things clear that means it makes things clear it's easy for a person to understand but at the same time Allah also says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 16 verse number 43 as well Asia chapter number 21 verse number 7 if you don't know ask the the person who possesses the message ask the person who's knowledgeable ask an Alim so if you're reading the Quran and while reading the Quran if you find something difficult to understand and ask a person who's a scholar ask an Alim if the Quran speaks about science and we find a difficult understanding who will you go to will you go to a cobbler will you go to a baba will go to a scientist if the Quran speaks about medicine you will go to a doctor to try and understand what does the Quran say similarly if you want to know about Quran meaning of certain words of the Quran then you go to an Alim who has gone to maybe for seven years or 14 years he is an expert in that field so the Quran says if you don't know if you end doubt ask the person who possessed the message so it is meant for the whole of humanity for the common man as well as for the scholars but while reading if you find any difficulty you can ask the person who's knowledgeable and that reminds me of an example that a few decades earlier in the late 70s and early 80s there were a group of Arabs who followed on the guidance of the verse of the Quran that if you don't Pur the message ask the person who has the knowledge and they collected all the material in the Quran and the say Hadith dealing with the subject of embryology and they presented it to professor kmore at that time in the late 70s and early 80s Prof Kitmore was one of the highest authorities in the field of emology in the world he was the head of the Department of anatomy in the University of Toronto in Canada and when he was shown the words of the Quran along with the English translation and he was asked that what are his comments so he said that most of the things that Quran speaks about embryology are 100% in Conformity with what we have come to know recently in modern embriology but there are a few verses which I cannot say that they are right neither can I say that they are wrong because I myself do not know them and two such verses were the first two vers of the Quran to be revealed Surah orter 96 verse number one and two which says read recite and Proclaim in the name of thy Lord who created who created the human beings from something which clings a Le like substance the word alaka means something which clings it also means a leash like substance so Prophet theur said I do not know whether the early stages of an Embryo Embryo means the early stage of the human being that is there in the womb of the mother embryology is the study of the human development he said he doesn't know whether the early stages of an embryo look like a leech or not so he went in his laboratory and under a very powerful microscope he observed the shape of an embryo and compared it with the photograph of a leech and he was astonished at the Striking resemblance and later on after reading the various vers of the Quran and the Hadith he said after about 50 more than 50 questions were asked to him more than 80 question asked to him and he said that if these questions were asked to me 30 years ago he said that in early ' 80s I would not be able to answer more than 50% of them because embryology is a branch of medicine which has advanced recently and he said that he has no objection in agreeing that this book is the word of Allah subhana wa taala is the word of almighty God and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the messenger of this almighty God and this book then later on whatever additional information he got he wrote a new book the developing human which even I had to refer when I was in the Medical College in the first year in the subject Anatomy he wrote the Third Edition for which he got an award for the best medical book written by a single author in that year and I to give you one more example that any machine that you buy along with it comes the instruction manual more complicated the machine more is the requirement of an instruction manual if you buy a machine which is more complicated like a computer the more difficult it is to understand the more requirement of instruction manual if you allow me to call the human beings a machine you have to agree it is the most complicated machine in the whole world don't you think this machine requires the instruction manual so according to me the Glorious Quran is the last and final instruction manual for the human beings the dos and don'ts for the human being is written in the Glorious Quran and that reminds me once there was a naab of Hyderabad naab is a person who like a landlord very rich person and when first time automobile was introduced in India people did not know to drive the car so along with the car the company even provided the driver so this Rich landlord naab of Hyderabad he buys a new car so the company along with the car provides him with a driver so one day in the morning he tells the driver that I want to take my wife beam Saba for shopping please keep the car ready the driver says n the car is not in working condition the naab gets angry and he says I want the car immediately in working condition condition because I want to take my wife for shopping so driver says to put the car in working condition I require 10 kg of Honey 20 L of milk 30 kgs of pure ghee and 50 k of rice that also basmati rice so the naab S gives him 10 K of Honey 20 L of milk 30 KS of pure ghe and 50 KES of basmati rice the driver takes it and gives it to his wife and within a few minutes the car is in working condition my question is that today suppose your driver says he requires 10 CES of Honey 20 L of milk 30 cages of pure G 50 KES of basmati rice what will you do if he says he requires these things to put the kind work in condition what will you do you K him out of the job because today even though we may not know to repair the car we know that the car doesn't work on honey milk rice or ghee it works on gas it works on petrol so therefore though we may not know how to repair the car we know the basic mechanism of the car if everyone knows the basic meaning of the Quran then no one will take you for a ride so you should know the basic meaning of the Quran and if the car gets spoiled once in a year or once in six months then you can go to a mechanic so why read in the Quran if you find something difficult to understand at that time surely you can can go to a person who knowledgeable and he will explain to you what is there in the Quran and just the last example how people they say that why is reading the Quran it's not required and it should be only by the alims and not by lay man they give an argument that if you have a learner driving license called AA license over here a learner's license and if you bang up the if you have an accident the police will give you a less fine but if you have permanent license a complete license and then if you do an accident then the police will find you double therefore it's better not to know the Quran not to understand the Quran and if you do sins then God will punish you less if you know the Quran and if you understand the Quran and then if you do a sin then Allah will punish you double I said I agree with you for the sake of argument that if a person has a temporary license a learner's license if he has a kacha license and if he does an accident he'll get half the punishment maybe he'll be fined $1,000 but if person has a permanent license a complete license and if he does an accident he'll be fine double maybe $2,000 but the point to be noted is that if a person who has a learner's license and has not learned driving correctly the Chan is that in one year he'll have an accident would be maybe 50 times but a person who learns how to drive and has a permanent license chances that he'll have an accident in the full is maybe once so if a person who has a proper license and learns driving he may end up paying a fine of $2,000 but the other person who has a learner's license who bangs up the car May 50 times ends up paying $50,000 at the end of the year so yet it's preferable that you should have a permanent license similarly you read the Quran with understanding and you implement on the message of Allah subhana wa ta'ala and the chances that you will commit sins and mistakes will be less if you read understanding rather than saying that it's only meant for the alims it's preferable that all the human beings they read the Quran with understanding and Implement on the message of Allah subhana wa taala last and final Revelation which was revealed the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon"
