  "title": "Making Salat in a Masjid built with Riba Mortgage? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. So my question is, there is like a nearby mosque that's being built, but it's like based on mortgage. So I was wondering if it's like Haram to pray there or like on the ruling on that? When a masjid is built by Haram money, whether it's money from mortgage or money from loans in riba or from an income of Haram, the sin is on the person who's financing it through such Haram means. But the masjid as a masjid, it is permissible for us to use and to pray in it because it remains the house of Allah Azza Wa Jal. Whether Allah will accept the deeds of the person who built it because he used Haram means or not, this is in Allah's hands and Allah knows best. Thank you."
