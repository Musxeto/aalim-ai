  "title": "Can children give Zakat to their parents who have no source of income? | Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "uh can a daughter pay zakah to the parents as they are very old and have no sources of income and in our calculation eligible for zika okay the scholars say that zakat cannot be given to your origins nor your branches this is a rough translation from arabic to english what origins were branches are we in a a tree it's like a tree so if i am the tree where i'm descended from so my parents my mother my father my grandfather my grandmother i cannot give them zakat and the branches those who descended from me my children my grandchildren i cannot give them zakat why well the rule is that it is my responsibility as a parent whether a father or a mother to provide for my children and for my parents this is my responsibility so if i have money and i have zakat i cannot give them from the zakat because i would hitting two birds with one stone rather i'm supposed to give from my own hard earned money to them as it's part of my duty to provide for them and allah knows best with the exception that some scholars said that only when my parents or my children have debts on them that i can pay off their debts because paying off my parents debts or my children debts does not come upon it does not come uh uh within the obligatory providing for them i'm not obliged to pay their debts so it's not my responsibility therefore i can give them from the zakat if the deaths are halal etc like i've mentioned a while ago"
