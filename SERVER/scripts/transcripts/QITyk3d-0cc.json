  "transcript": "so the first question is a lot of people have had to lie to their parents in order to come to the event today for different reasons uh maybe because it's a religious event or maybe because different reasons the sister is asking what is the ruling on this in terms of uh making this lie in order to come to an islamic event is not of the characteristic of a believer and it is prohibited to lie in islam except in three situations number one lying of the man to his wife and the wife to her husband and we have to put a disclaimer this is not for the men to lie when they're going to hang out with their friends and they say to their wives we're going for a business meeting or i'm on call or i have to do this or that no this is not permissible lying lying between the spouses is in what increases the love so if she comes out to her husband in a new dress that it is three sizes smaller than her actual size instead of him laughing and saying this is your grandchild's dress you say masha allah how beautiful this stress is on you i don't know who makes the other more beautiful you or the dress and this will give you peace for another six months likewise if your husband comes out from the shower with his towel on inshallah and he flexes his muscles in front of the mirror and says how do i look instead of laughing for half an hour and ending up in divorce you say masha allah you look like arnold schwarzenegger what is this what is this masha allah so this lying is halal number one number two lying in war so war is about deceit the enemies of islam you're about to meet them and one of them is listening at your communications and you clearly say that we're headed north to meet the enemies they will find out and ambush you no you say well we're heading south or we are not fighting anymore this is not lying this is halal by the prophets saying because this is war he's interested in killing you so defending yourself with this is permissible and number four i was just checking your eyesight number three is when you try to reconcile between two two are fighting hating one another's guts and you go to one of them and say masha allah the brother abdullah he is fighting with you but he said yesterday when i visited him so many good about things about you and he said that if this is shaytan if i only i can get to meet him inshallah everything would go and then you go to abdullah and say the same thing and you managed to reconcile this is not lying because it is for a better good now when we come to this lecture you ask i have to lie to my parents for brothers you don't have to lie you can go against your parents instruction for seeking knowledge because they cannot restrict men from going out the nature of men is to work to study so if you get a scholarship in medina university and they said no i don't want you to go are you obliged to obey no if there are people to take care of them and they don't need you you can go without their permission am i not dis obeying them you are in jihad you're seeking knowledge you're a man you are allowed to do this when it comes to the sisters it's different you're obliged to obey your father and not leave the home without his permission your mother is secondary because your mother is emotional so if someone proposes to you your father says he's a good man from a good family rich and i approve it and your mother says by allah if you marry him i will not speak to you until the day of judgment go ahead and marry him she's emotional she does not have authority on you in such things this is why your guardian is your father he is who counts in yes or no so if your father tells you don't go you have to obey him you have to stay back but shaykh i want to learn alhamdulillah we have internet we have dvds we have cassette recorders we have mp3 the knowledge will come to you but is it the knowledge you want or you want to just leave the home and be out this is something you have to ask yourself and allah knows best besides you can always use double talk so you don't you don't have to say a straightforward lie yeah and if someone brother john usually asks this a lot he says uh i was joking maybe uh he wants money from me and he says do you have a hundred pounds i said well hey i don't have money in my pocket and i'm meaning that no a hundred pound bill if there is any no see i haven't lied i don't have a hundred pound bill in my pocket this is not a lie this is called in arabic seeming lies because he understands it in a way different to what i intended it and this might be inshallah a way out on alano's best you"
