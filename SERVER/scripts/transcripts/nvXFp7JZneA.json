  "title": "How to repent in Ramadan if I committed Major Sins in the past and will my sins be forgiven",
  "transcript": "Question from the audience Razdul from India. Sheikh, my question is if someone has committed a major sin in the past, then how should he repent during the month of Ramadan? And will his sins be forgiven? Whatever sins you've committed, you have to repent immediately and not wait until Ramadan. But hypothetically, you've started to repent today in Ramadan, it's like any other day. You have to quit the sin, intend not to do it again, have remorse in your heart, ask Allah for forgiveness, and do as many good deeds as you want. If you fulfill all of these, In Sha Allah, you will be forgiving. You're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it In Sha Allah, within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
