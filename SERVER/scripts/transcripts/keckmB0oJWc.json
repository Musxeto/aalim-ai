  "transcript": "Fahad from Kenya. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Ya Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Ahsanallahu Alaykum. Jambu Jambu Kareebu Alaykum. Yes. Ahsanta Ya Sheikh. My question basically is concerning the refill of LPG cylinders. Refilling the? LPG cylinders, the cooking gas. Ah okay, okay, the butane gas, okay. Yeah, my cylinder is actually belonging to a different company, but due to the high pricing of selling the refill, I go to refill from a company B, which officially it's not allowed, but I own the cylinder, I bought it with my own money. No problem. You're paying for the gas. Nobody controls whether you fill it from this or that. They sold you the cylinder. Yes, they want to have a monopoly that you always come back to them, but I don't want to. I want to go to some other vendor who would sell me gas cheaper, and I'm happy with that. There is no problem in that, inshallah. Providing there is no breaking of the law. Nobody is going to catch you red-handed with doing such a crime."
