  "title": "Is usher (zakat 1/10th) applicable on fish production? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "This question is from Brother Raja Amir. Is ushr applicable on fish production, aquaculture, from running stream water? If yes, then is it allowed to exclude the expenses? I have no idea what you said. So he's talking about the, like zakat, we have ushr, the tax that we pay onâ€¦ Ushr? Ushr. Ushr. Okay. The ushr, one-tenth. One-tenth. The ushr is one-tenth. Yes. Okay. Of what? He's asking if that is applicable on fish production. Fish production? No. Ushr is only applicable to irrigated land that you don't have to irrigate. It's irrigated through rainfall, if you have a farming land, and it's irrigated through rainfall, or there is a stream coming, or there's water from underground that you don't have to put or buy tanks of water and drive them all the way. No, it's something available there. This is what you give zakat for, one-tenth of the production of your harvest. If the product is a zakatable, such as corn, such as wheat, such as barley, such as dates, such as raisins, et cetera, but if it's watermelon, if it is oranges, if it is vegetables, cucumbers, tomatoes, these are not zakatable. Fish products that you make, a fish factory or fish industry, this is not zakatable unless you're selling it. And if you're selling it, then it's 2.5% like all products that we sell in our grocery shops, in our clothing shops, in our trades. Jazakallah khair, Sheikh. Jazakallah khair."
