  "title": "Can we celebrate the Prophet’s ‎ﷺ birthday (12 Rabbi ul Awal  Milad /Mawlid)? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "was born in this hijri month of and people start celebrating from the beginning of this month saying that this is the month in which prophet was born so we celebrate his coming is this permissible this is a good question and you can cascade this question to similar questions that follow the same pattern and this pattern is are we allowed to introduce something in the religion of islam because the prophet alaihissalatu wasallam told us that he left us on clarity and certainty where day and night are so clear to everyone to see and likewise things in religion are similarly clear and no one would go astray except someone who's doomed the prophet says he also told us that whoever innovates in our affairs in our religion what is not part of it it is rejected so the month of rabbi al-awwal the third month of the hijri calendar does it have any importance to the muslims well we know ramadan is important we know the sacred four months are important we know the three months of hajj are important we know that um things that allah or the prophet hassam had said to us that they are important we consider them to be important but is it up to us to select for example the month of rajab and say that this is the month that the night journey the miraculous night journey took place so we praise it or the month of shaban because it has the middle of shaban night in it or this or that do we have this privilege to do so well we have to go back to the basics and the base basics state that innovating in islam is not permissible the basics for any muslim like you and me who are logical we're not scholars we're not intellectual people we are laymen we know that we have the quran we have the sunnah so we go through the biography of the prophet we find that scholars differed whether he was born in the month of the 12th of rabbi or the ninth or before that or not but all scholars agree that the prophet sallam died on the twelfth of he died he passed away on this month so are you celebrating his birth or his death watch out secondly what is more important his birth where he lived for 40 days like any other human being or the day he was revealed to and became a prophet a messenger of allah definitely this is the day to be praised if we were to praise it thirdly did the prophet allah ever in his life tell us anything about the issue of rabbi al-awl being important being good being this or being that has he ever highlighted the date of birth which is twelfth of rabbi al-awwals as claimed by a lot of scholars and it's an issue of dispute has he ever said to us that this is something that you guys have to praise and look up to and celebrate now we know that when he came to medina he found the people of medina celebrating and feasting and when he asked them he told him allah has substituted you with two days better the day of reid al-hajj and the day of edelfertor that's it two days to celebrate throughout the whole year never ever he mentioned anything about his birthday or the birthday of isab no mariam or the birthday of ibrahim al-khalil peace be upon them all his companions who loved him more than we love him without any doubt had never ever mentioned it or celebrate it so is it possible that we know more than them that we love him more than them or is it possible that shaytan is messing up with our deen because we are ignorant and we are so deviated from the straight path that we're not concerned we're not even wanting to refer back to the quran and sunnah for answers this is a question you have to answer and you have to do your due diligence whether you're following the prophet sallam for real or you're following following your whims and desires and what your corrupt peers and saints and so-called mawlana are telling you to do without any evidence neither from the quran nor from the sunnah and may allah make the muslims follow the sunna and abide by it you"
