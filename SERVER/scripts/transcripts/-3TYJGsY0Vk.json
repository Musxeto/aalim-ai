  "title": "Dawah: Persist or leave them alone? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from the US. So I had a question regarding, again I had a question regarding similar to dawah. I feel like sometimes in Ramadan or when I'm talking to friends, I try to give them dawah and they respond with, oh I don't, I don't, I feel like I know enough, I don't want you to tell me this, should I persist in giving them or should I just leave them alone after I tell them what to do? Ahmed when people are accepting what you're giving them, this is when you continue to give. When someone tells you to please stop and refrain, you should not pressure them or shove it down their throats. Rather move on and look for someone else who would take your dawah and accept your call. It is not wise to force people to listen when they don't want to listen. You don't have authority over them and usually this would backfire. So instead of them getting closer to Allah, starting to practice, they hate what you're preaching them and they hate the people that look like you, thinking that everyone who looks like you would be like you trying to shove it down their throat. So no, you have to be wise in giving them or spoon feeding them according to their acceptance. If they are reciprocating and listening, give them a bit more. The moment you feel that they had enough or they're saturated, stop and give it some time and then a little bit, give them some small dosages until it pays off inshaAllah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
