  "transcript": "pakistan uh i have a question regarding uh animation uh i watched your video previously which you said that uh animating anything uh is haram uh but my question is regarding uh educational videos on youtube so uh we have to animate like uh if you're describing an animal we have to animate that animal or if we are describing anything regarding human uh human biology we have to animate the human body or we have to animate a human teacher to teach the children in the video just like the advertisements i saw before your show started like 10 minutes ago okay so is that ram or uh if you can clarify and what the specific uh conditions is it's halal to animate uh something from pakistan says what is the ruling on animation see animation and correct me if i'm wrong is drawing and drawing is permissible unless it involves life and by life we mean the spirit the soul so drawing a human being drawing animals drawing what people would look at and say that this has life in it this is haram so what about using it for educational purposes scholars differed some remained on saying it is haram specifically for those who do the actual actual drawing the prophet said al-samin many authentic hadiths that the most severely punished on the day of judgment are those who draw live pictures of humans or animals or fish or birds etc and they will be tormented and they give on the day of judgment by these characters that they had created so doing this is sinful other group of scholars said that if it's permissible for children to play with dolls this means that creating such cartoons for children to watch and learn and to be entert entertained by is permissible and this is their opinion now i'm inclined to the first opinion which says that's totally haram however if you draw a human being without facial features and this drawing is 2d not 3d a 3d is a statue even if it does not have facial features it's a statue of a human being and this is totally haram but if you draw something on a paper and it has no um facial features this is not considered to be drawing because such a drawing is not a character is not a human being so if i were to write something like this so this is a face this is a body this is arms and and legs and i'm not picasso so sue me this is okay because this is not an image of a human being this is lines so if you do this no problem if you write or draw a pen that has a head and arms and legs and it moves and it talks but no facial features there's no problem doing that if you are doing it for educational purposes and you for example have to draw the anatomy of the human body there is no problem in that someone studying biology he has to draw the intestines for example or the stomach or the respiratory system there's no problem in that and i hope this answers your question you"
