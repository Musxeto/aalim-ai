  "transcript": "A man from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sometimes I wish that a sister calls and her name is a woman instead of a man. Anyhow, what can I do for you man? May Allah bless you Sheikh. I learned so much from you. Yes and may Allah protect you. And you as well. My question is that in universities where I live people, usually the disbelievers mock us and mock our religion. So I get very angry and very agitated and I start to you know get into a fight with them. But I also see many Muslim brothers making fun of their own religion and mocking the things taught in our religion. So what should I do in such cases? Akhi, I always tell people this. When you are walking in the streets of Delhi or Mumbai or Chennai and a dog barks you, will you ever fall on your hands and knees and bark back? Of course not. He's a dog. So when such ignorant imbeciles mock your religion, shrug your shoulders and move out. Move away. Don't listen to them. Don't even give them any attention. Don't fight with flies that come and bug you because they're flies. You don't go down to their level. The Muslims who retaliate and start to curse their religion and make fun of their gods, they're doing a big, big sin and something that is wrong. Allah stated clearly in the Quran, do not insult the idols that they worship if this would lead them to insult Allah. Though insulting their idols is a good deed. Why? Because they're false. They worship private parts. They have temples of private parts and they worship them. They worship monkeys. They worship rats. They worship cows. They worship dung. They worship anything. They have like 65,000 gods. This is their intellect. This is how they think. How they think. Good for them. Don't insult their gods if they're going to insult our Sharia and our own religion and Allah Azza wa Jal. This is what is mentioned in the Quran. So let them say whatever they say. Shrug your shoulders and move away from them and don't even pay attention to any dog that barks at you and Allah knows best. you"
