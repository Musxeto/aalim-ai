  "transcript": "Mohsin from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, can you recommend good Tadabbur books or cassettes or playlists or anything like this in the direction of Tadabbur? Because I feel like there is a lack of English Tafseer or Tadabbur of the Quran Maybe you can start an own series InshaAllah, if Allah opens this door for you And Barak Allahu Fikum, may Allah accept from you and increase you in knowledge and piety Ameen, Jazak Allah Khair and Jazak Allah Khair for thinking well of me I don't have any knowledge in this field and I have not done any of my own reading in the field of Tadabbur Tadabbur is something that Allah gives to you the more you read the Quran And this Alhamdulillah we do And the more you research in Tafseer and the more you read in Tafseer books And Alhamdulillah this is also done but we are not doing enough No matter what you do, you will never do enough with the book of Allah The Quran is a treasure that has no limits It's a notion that has no shores So no matter what you do, you will never be satisfied or fulfilled thinking that I've done a little So to me I don't know The best way of Tadabbur is to continuously read the Quran on daily basis at least one Juz' And to have a portion of Tafseer from different books so that you can comprehend And Allah will open doors of Tadabbur for you Insha'Allah Azza wa Jal"
