  "title": "If a person continues to recite Subhana Rabbi ala when rising from sujood, is that rakat valid?",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangledesh. If a person for example continues \nto recite the dhikr [ ] even when   he starts to get up meaning he doesn't \nstop then gets up but he still recites it,   when he \nstarts to rise up, is that Rakah valid? So if he performed the prescribed Zhikr \nwhere it is supposed to be whether in Ruku   or in Sujood, when he rises up from Ruku \nor Sujood he continues to say the Zhikr.   Is there anything prescribed to be said when \nrising from sujud to standing up position,   the answer is other than Allahu Akbar, no \nthere's nothing we say during the rising up, so if he continues to say [ ] would he be \ndoing something wrong? The answer is yes,   this was not prescribed, and you should not have \ndone this, is he going to impact the validity   of his Rakah, the answer is no, the pillars \nare fulfilled, the mandatory actions and Zhikr   were said in place, so there's nothing wrong in \nwhat he has done except that he did not follow   the Sunnah by adding such Zhikr where it should \nnot have been said and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
