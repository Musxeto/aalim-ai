  "title": "No way to leave during the Congregational Dua, how to avoid the bidah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "ABD from Pakistan how are youum I'm fine alhamdulillah so she have a question about congregational Dua when most of the times when I get the chance to leave the circle where this is happening I do leave it but many of times it happens especially M and Isa that whenever the Salah is concluded the Imam immediately starts the Cong congregational Dua and when I look behind I see that there is no way to believe because people are praying behind me so in such a case should I when the Sal is concluded should I only look once behind me or should I keep looking to see a way out because many times I'm the only one who leaves in this case when the Dua is being made it is not mandatary for you to leave if there is hardship or that would cause you problems or there is no way so yes you can stay but you don't join them in their Dua by saying aan and you can also stand up and uh change your position if you're you're able to do this and pray Sunnah and you can just sit there and do your AAR until they finish and Allah Knows Best"
