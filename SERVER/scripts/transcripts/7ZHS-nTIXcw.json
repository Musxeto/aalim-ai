  "title": "Masjid gave a Ramadan timetable but Fajr is 20 min later than Umm Al Qura timings, which to follow?",
  "transcript": "cashif from the US the local Masid next to me they gave us um a piece of paper for the prayer times for the whole month of Ramadan and I asked the Imam and he said that uh they're going to call the Adan the same time as um the time on the paper but the time on the paper is about for the fudger time is about 20 to 30 minutes minutes from the time earlier or later it's uh later okay and then but another mid that's about 8 minute drive from my house that um Masid is about one minute away from um time so I'm confused onto which to follow follow timing for your fasting and if you want to be safe and pray in the 20 minutes later Masjid the prayer that's fine but for the fasting stick with timing and Allah Knows Best"
