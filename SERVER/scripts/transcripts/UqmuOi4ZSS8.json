  "transcript": "Faheem from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh for example I joined the Imam from the second rakah however he made a mistake in the first rakah which I am not aware of so after the last At-Taihaat when he is offering prostration of forgetfulness by offering salam only to the right should I follow him by offering salam to the right and then to prostrations of forgetfulness or should I do it with him without offering salam to the right? As long as he did not conclude the prayer by offering two salams you should follow the whole process Inshallah."
