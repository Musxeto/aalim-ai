  "transcript": "so my question is if I am sick with a contagious illness then am I excused from going for for congregational prayer Okay so this is an issue that we have to look at realistically and logically if I'm sick with a contagious illness I was sick for a whole week from the flu and a sore throat and this is why I did not come last week for ask zad for two days alhamdulillah did I stop going to the Masjid no why because I had a normal cold I didn't have any fever and you don't stop going to the Masjid because of cold oh but we have covid-19 around 21 and 22 and 22 3 maybe and it goes on forever am I going to stop going to the message because of that no this is not a pandemic this is a normal cold get over it everybody has it if you have something similar to that this does not stop you from going to the Masjid if you want to be if you want to be a bit precautious and careful but don't stop going to the Masjid rather wear a face mask and carry sanitizers with you so every time you blow your nose you just put some and clean your hands so that you can shake hands with others without contaminating them but this is not a reason to stop going to the Masjid yes if you have something a bit more dangerous a pandemic like the covet then in this case it is a legitimate reason to stop going to the Masjid and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
