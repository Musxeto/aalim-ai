  "title": "Is it ok to work at a riba based bank or insurance company if you're not directly dealing with riba?",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Before I ask my question, I just want to say that the lecture, MashaAllah, is very beautiful, one of the most beautiful ones. The what? Shukran. Your lecture, the one you just gave, is very beautiful. May Allah Azza Wa Jal benefit me before any of you guys, because I'm the one who's getting older and my heart is pumping still. And I pray to Allah that we benefit from it, rather than just take the knowledge and brush it off. Ameen. Jazak Allah Khair. My question is Sheikh, you know, somebody is working like an insurance company or a bank, and it's Riba based, but their department is not related to Riba. Maybe the person's a teller, and he's just accepting the deposits or he's giving out the withdrawal like for the customer. Is this section okay to work in, even though the whole company is like Riba based? Okay. The scholars said there is a difference between a company or an institution that is solely made and structured on haram, and another company that has partially haram in it, but the line of work is halal. So for the first one, an insurance company, the whole business of insurance is haram. Banking, conventional interest based banking, their main objective is Riba, interest usury. Yeah, they may have transfers here and there, but it's peanuts. It's like 0.5% of their actual work, which is in treasuries and bonds and Riba big time. So working for such a company that is main source of income is haram, and structured on haram, working for them even as a janitor or as a driver or a security personnel is haram. Because this is assisting them on their evil and Allah says, and collaborate upon righteousness and piety and do not collaborate upon transgression and sin. As for the other company or institution or whatever, that line of work is halal. They're producing commodity. They're producing goods. They're consulting firms that does not do haram, mainly speaking, but they may deposit their money in a bank and take interest. They may finance some of the products in haram. You working for IT or working for the assembly line or as an engineer or in the likes, you have nothing to do with the haram income or department. Your job is halal. Another example is a teacher in a high school, in a public school. He teaches math. He teaches physics. His job is halal. The school is halal, though we know that the government deals with Riba and with other haram income. So would I say, no, you can't work there? No, because the main structure of the government and the country and the schooling system is halal. There might be some haram incomes here or there, but this does not impact your job. And I hope this answers your question."
