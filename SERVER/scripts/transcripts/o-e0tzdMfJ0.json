  "transcript": "Rakib from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I have a very serious issue. I'll try to sum up everything shortly. During my school days I didn't have much knowledge about life and Islam and I was very easygoing and I was an excellent student. Later on when COVID came I started exploring everything about life and Islam and Allah guided me and I started getting very ambitious like these are my worldly and religious goals and I want to achieve them but at the same time I didn't put the right efforts and execute all the things well. But for the last two years I'm trying my heart and soul to achieve the goals I set for myself and I'm putting in efforts but I'm kind of stuck in a loop where I work some days and I feel like I'm improving and then after that I fall into sinning again and being lazy not feeling like working, anxiety, depression and all the stuff. Initially I thought that maybe everything is my fault and I'm not putting the right efforts but recently I feel like I cannot always feel like I'm not putting the right efforts because I'm trying the same thing for the last two years. I feel like it could be something like evil eye, envy etc because I noticed that a lot of people around me are envious of me and they are like oh how are you so good in studies, how do you learn things so quick, how are you practicing, how are you so ambitious about life and etc etc. It's not anything like that I was working amazingly well before and suddenly everything changed so the question advised me on this truth. Okay first of all if you are as you've stated then this is an evil eye. An evil eye is cured with the grace of Allah by doing Ruqya as I mentioned in the previous question and you can find the format of the Ruqya on my website and also on my YouTube channel with the grace of Allah. Apply this on 10-20 bottles of water, drink 10 bottles of water every day throughout the day till the night and Inshallah in four to five days you will feel an improvement if not totally cured. If not then you come back to me and I'll tell you what the problem is Inshallah."
