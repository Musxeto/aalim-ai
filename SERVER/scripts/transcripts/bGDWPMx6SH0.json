  "transcript": "Yusuf from Egypt Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi So Sheikh, before I say my question I just wanted to say that in one of your videos you made a mistake when talking about Prophet Ibrahim A.S. You said Allah sacrificed him when Allah substituted him so I just wanted to clarify that and my question is, is holding the Quran with the left hand an act of apostasy? Okay. So as for the mistake, I don't remember what I said Akhi. I don't remember any of my lectures. The moment I prepare a lecture and I present it, a couple of days later it's gone in thin air. I don't have a long term memory. I have short term memory. My hard disk has been formatted and gone. I only rely on my RAM. So did I say this? I don't know. I have to see it. Maybe you misheard it. Maybe I missaid it. It happens. Secondly, as for holding the Quran with your left hand, Allah gave us two hands and He told us not to hold our private parts or clean ourselves after defecating or urinating with our right hand. So now we know what to avoid. And He told us not to eat and drink and give and take with our left hand. So now I know. Other than that, it's fine when I prostrate. Should I place one hand on the ground which is my right and my left hand behind my back? Or should I put them both? No, you should put them both. So in standing up, should I put my left hand on my chest or would this be apostasy? No, you have to do this because it's part of praying. Likewise, if I hold my Quran with my right or with my left, there is no preference, none whatsoever. Oh but Sheikh, we know that the left hand is used for indecent things. Yeah, but this is not the default. So if I'm eating a cheeseburger and it's big, double or triple layer, should I do this or can I hold it with both hands? I can hold it with both hands. If I'm drinking from a big vessel that I can't carry with one, I can hold them with both hands. There is no problem in holding the Quran with your left hand, let alone it being apostasy. It's not even sinful to hold it with your left hand and Allah knows best."
