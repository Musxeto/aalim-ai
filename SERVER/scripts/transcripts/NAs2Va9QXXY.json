  "transcript": "a friend of mine borrowed money from me so I transferred to him 1,400 Ringgits Malaysian Ringgit and he received 257 euros when he wanted to send back the 257 euros the exchange rate came down to 1100 Ringgits so this is a loss of three hundreds on his side so what is the right way of doing it it depends on the initial transaction your friends your friend is in France tells you send me some money I need to borrow from you if you told him I'll lend you 1400 Ringgits then he has to return it exactly as 1400 Ringgits if he told you or if you told him okay then I'll send you 210 and 57 euros then he has to return the euros but he cannot play with the currency as you wish so the initial agreement there's no contract he tells you I need money how much do you need if he tells you I need two hundred and fifty seven euros then you have to receive two hundred and fifty seven years a value of today's exchange rate if he says I need fourteen hundred Ringgits then he has to return to you what you receive in your bank account as fourteen hundred ingots and Allah knows best"
