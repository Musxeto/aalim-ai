  "transcript": "Suleiha from India. Sheikh, my mom wants to buy gold ring and wear it in index finger and in that ring its name is written as Allah's name. So, is it permissible? First of all, women, according to the most authentic opinion, are exempted from the prohibition of wearing rings in these two fingers. According to the hadith narrated by Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, and the hadith is in Sahih Hilma Muslim, in the chapter dealing with adornments and clothes. The Prophet prohibited us from wearing rings in the index finger and in the middle finger. So the scholars said that this is specifically for men. Others say yes, it's for all, both men and women. But the most authentic opinion is that women are not excluded from adorning themselves in whatever finger they wish. So it is restricted to men. Wearing a ring with the name of Allah is permissible. The Prophet's seal, alayhi salatu wa salam, which was a ring, had the writings engraved on it, Muhammad Rasul Allah. So the name of Allah was there, the name of Muhammad was there. And some of the Salaf used to write or engrave reminders on their rings. This is permissible, but we have to be careful not to enter the toilet with such an engravement or such a ring. Like the Prophet, whenever he went, alayhi salatu wa salam, to answer the call of nature, he used to take off his ring. So we should do the same. Is it recommended? I personally believe that one should not do that, because usually when you wear a ring with only Allah's name engraved on it, what is the purpose? Most likely, you would think that this is a form of protection and to bring good to you. And this by itself is a minor shirk that can mount to major shirk. So you should refrain from that if you have such an intention, and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
