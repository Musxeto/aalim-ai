  "transcript": "Abu Abdullah from Belgium Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So, for my studies, I want to buy a new laptop and I found this laptop in multiple physical stores, so actual physical stores in my city and the price in the stores is approximately everywhere 1200 Euros, so 1200 Euros and I'm able to pay this price but online, on webshops and websites, I found the same laptop but cheaper for 100 Euros, so it's 100 Euros cheaper and it has an extra benefit and it's a keyboard, so if I go to the store in my country, physical stores, it has a different keyboard and my preference is for the keyboards online, so the laptop online, it would be better and cheaper for me even though both, it's not a major problem, the price and keyboard, it's not a major problem, it's just a minor problem So, overall, online laptops, they are cheaper and better than the physical but the difference is that if I go to one of the stores in my city that sells laptops I just go in, I pay the price and I take the laptop and I leave but if I want to order the laptop on almost every website, I cannot order the laptop except after accepting or checking a button that says that I accept their terms of services and privacy notice and conditions of use and sales and terms of conditions and stuff like this and if you would read these regulations, you would find that one of the things you accept before ordering is that if there's a problem or dispute between me and the store, that I agree to submit to the rules of the certain country or state so I agree to judge according to something else than the Sharia of Allah So, and if you read further in these regulations, I think you would find a lot of other things that are not according to the Sharia So, my question is, do I have to go to the store and pay a bit more and get a bit worse laptop or can I just order online? Order online, Akhi, and don't pay any attention to the terms and conditions because these are only made for legal reasons so that you would not sue them Order it and pay it in cash and just take your laptop and move on and there's no problem in that Inshallahu Azzawajal"
