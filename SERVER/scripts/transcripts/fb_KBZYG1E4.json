  "transcript": "[Music] AC alhamdulillah when we talk about purification generally speaking the best purifier on Earth is water therefore Scholars always spent a lot of time explaining to their students and to the masses the importance of water and they classified water water into either two or three classifications some schools of thought say that water is divided into three types which is totally pure you can wash impurities with it and you can uplift major and minor ritual impurities with it then which is pure but cannot uplift major and minor ritual impurity but it's pure by itself and thirdly NIS which is impure and this classification if you go back to the Quran and the to the Sunnah you will find that it is incorrect as the Quran and the Sunnah only refer us to pure and NIS there is no third category in the Quran or in the Sunnah so what is pure water pure water is the water that Allah has created and is not mixed up with with an impurity that may change its color taste or smell and they give an example of sea water river water water coming from Springs found in Wells all of these are considered to be pure water and without any dispute such water removes filth washes off filth and uplifts major and minor ritual impurity the evidence is verses of the Quran such as and we send down from the sky pure water and when Travelers by sea ask the prophet Alat wasam about a problem they face while traveling while sailing and that is they have scarce Sweet Water or pure water and they can only use this to drink and if they use it to perform Abu they'll fall into thirst and they'll run out out of water so the prophet said to him to them regarding seawater its water is pure and its dead meat that is the fish uh is halal so this indicates that any type of pure water is permissible for us to use to uplift major and minor ritual impurities and to remove and wash off impurities and nasat now why did scholars say that there is a third category which is theah they said this because they made a mistake you see when water as it is is found this is pure what if it's mixed as in the case of sea waterer and it's salty we can't drink it it remains water and it's called water so it is and at the same time what if normal water is mixed with pure substances that does not change its characteristics to the extent that it takes it out from the category of water give me an example in some countries you have steel or not even steal uh ductile pipes or uh uh iron cast iron pipes in their houses so when they use water sometimes it comes a bit yellowish due to corrosion and rust so this is not the water we know because the color is changed maybe the taste is a bit changed but it's still water because it didn't change Dr plastically so the name remains to be water so we can use this as well what confused them is when we have a glass or a bucket of water and I drop three or four bags of tea and then I take them off so what is this substance in front of me everybody would say this is tea ah so can I can I use this to uplift minor or RIT major ritual impurity they said um duh no because we can only do this with water and this is not water this is why they called this to be water that is which is not true this is not water the name has been changed into T it's a different substance altogether even if soft drinks are 95% water they're not water anymore it's called soft drinks so there is no category as it's either or and this is why you have to understand your straight from the Quran and also from the Sunnah question some schools of thought say that if I perform woodo or I perform a total bath from a bucket and some of the water that I've used fall into the bucket I cannot use the bucket anymore because the water in it has been used again when we go back to the Quran and to the Sunnah we find no reference to what they are saying at all and it is baseless what do you mean by baseless I mean that the water I used there's nothing in the Quran or in the Sunnah says I cannot use it anymore so used water in W or in is totally pure unless one of the three characteristics has changed via or through an impurity if the smell if the color if the taste has not changed by a an impurity urine or feis and the likes in this case it is still pure and I'll give you example many of us the elders that is may find it difficult to raise their feet to the Basin and wash them in woodo so they have a bucket of water and they simply dip their foot in it and take it out then they dip the other foot in it and take it out is their woodoo valid according to the Quran and the Sunnah it is valid According to some schools of thought they said no this is used water it can't be used but as we've stated earlier and we always State bring us your evidences to prove that this water cannot be used and if you fail to do do this then we cannot follow what you are saying and Allah Asel Knows [Music] Best [Music] Z"
