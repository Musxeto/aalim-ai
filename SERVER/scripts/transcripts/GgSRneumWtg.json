  "transcript": "Farooq from Pakistan so I have read from my medical research paper that was static or be ejaculatory food which is released before the man image so does this mean that every time we have red team so we met semen we must watch it or in the closed that it got that it got on because it might be mixed with Maddie it might be mixed with methi this might between two brackets is it certainty or doubtful puddle uh I I don't it's doubtful I guess as long as it is doubtful we do not care what medical researchers say we apply the Quran the Sunnah now you tell me didn't mother Allah be pleased with her tell us in an authentic Hadith that Whenever there were traces of semen on the garments of the Prophet Allah if it's dry she would remove it with her nail and if it is wet she would wash it off the answer is yes so if it's sanajasa removing it with her nail would not have purified it and she did not have this assumption which you have that oh it might have been mixed with mevi or pre-com or prosthetic fluid because medical researchers say so and so and so this is an Islamic related issue we don't go to medical researchers or to science we implement the Quran the Sunnah and the Quran and the Sunnah tell us that semen is pure and it doesn't tell us whether we have to take it to a laboratory to analyze it to see the percentage of many mixed with it there's nothing like that in Islam so one should not exaggerate and go overboard with such whiswas and with such ideas and Allah Knows Best"
