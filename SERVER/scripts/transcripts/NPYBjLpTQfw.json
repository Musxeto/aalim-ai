  "transcript": "Surya from Qatar Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu What happens is after coming Maghreb, I pray Dhuhr Khaza, Asr Khaza and then I pray Maghreb. Is it accepted? Is it valid? Will my prayers be accepted by Allah? Okay, your Dhuhr and Asr are not accepted. They are invalid, whether you pray them or not. Your Maghreb is accepted and you have committed a major sin by skipping your Dhuhr and Asr. Allah Azza Wa Jal says, Prayers were prescribed at specific times. Can we pray Maghreb prayer while the sun is still up? The answer is no. Why? Because a prayer has a beginning time and an end time. We have to pray in between. If we pray before the time, the prayer is invalid. And if we pray after the time, the prayer is invalid. So you cannot delay or postpone your Dhuhr prayer or Asr prayer until you reach home. You have to pray them at school. You have to take five or ten minutes, whether they like it or not, between classes. Do whatever you need. Go to the toilet, go to the bathroom, you have a break and pray your Dhuhr and Asr on time. Otherwise, you will be committing a major sin. And even if you make them up as Qaza, it will not be accepted. Some scholars go even further to claim that if you miss Dhuhr intentionally until the time expires, you have left the fold of Islam. May Allah protect us all. May Allah protect us all."
