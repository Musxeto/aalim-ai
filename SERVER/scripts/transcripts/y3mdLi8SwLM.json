  "title": "Switched from Hanafi to Following Sunnah when I need a fatwa, do I need to follow a specific madhab",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu First of all I want to say she gives a privilege to be here, it's an honor. I wanted to ask, like, I'm originally from Pakistan but I grew up in Saudi Arabia. And so my parents used to follow Hanafi. So we are Sunni Hanafi. But when I grew up I found out that there are lots of pithas that we do. We do Quran khani, we do, you know, 40 days after death we do another Quran khani, and when we buy a new house we do Quran khani and things like that. So I slowly stepped away from Hanafi. So now I follow, Alhamdulillah, I found your videos which I find really beneficial. And I try to follow Sunnah, Ahadith, Quran from what Tabatabi did. But lots of people tell me that this is wrong. You must follow a sect. What you're doing is not right. So I want to ask, is it mandatory to follow a sect? The Prophet ï·º is the one who we are ordered to follow. Allah says in the Quran, On the Day of Judgment Allah will call them and say, What did you respond to the messengers? So Allah will not ask you on the Day of Judgment, What did you respond to Imam Ahmed Ibn Hanbal or Imam Muhammad Ibn Idrees Al Shafi'i or to Imam Malik Ibn Anas or to Imam Abu Hanifa. or with this authentic Hadith that was reported to you. This is what Allah will ask you upon. However, we most likely are not qualified to know what is a Quran verse or what is a Hadith. The vast majority of Muslims, especially non-Arabs, if you say to them, tell me which Surah, and raise your hands if you know, you might get a prize. You might. I don't know. The organizers, MashaAllah, they have a lot of money. They invited me in so they can afford it. So raise your hand if you know which Surah this is. Innamal a'malu binniyat Okay, MashaAllah, which chapter? It's a Hadith. It's not an Ayah. The majority, I thought it was in Ikhlas. No, it's not. So this is a problem. Lots of the Muslims don't know the difference between a verse of the Quran and a Hadith. Then they say, oh, should we follow an imam? Of course you should follow an imam. You don't have what it takes. What is this queue? Is there full? Come on, guys. You're really making me scared. All of these are for questions. It's got to be a long night. Because we're laymen. I'm a layman in mechanics. So when my car breaks, I'm not going to open the hood and say, hmm, let me think. No, I'm not going to think. I'm going to call AAA. I'm going to call a mechanic. I'm going to call a friend that knows how to deal with it. The same thing in Islam. You don't have what it takes to come and think, I'm going to follow this. No, the Hanafi school is wrong. What do you know what's right and what's wrong? You don't have the knowledge to discredit an opinion from Hanafi school or Shafi'i school or whatever school. Just because you read an article here or there doesn't make you a student of knowledge. Yes, you can do that. Otherwise, you have to follow, not a sect, not a madhab. You have to follow an imam. He doesn't have weird opinions that go against the mainstream of Islam. And you should follow him in whatever he tells you. Most likely, this individual would be a follower of one of the four main schools of thought. So you follow Ibn Baz, you're in good hands. You follow Ibn Uthaymeen, you're in excellent hands with the grace of Allah. And the more these are prone to fall into temptation and fitna, the better they are. They're dead. They're definitely not going to go for something that suits the highest bidder. The living ones, you never know. I'm a family man. If you push me too far, I just might. So you never know. No, follow those who you can trust and you can believe in. And on the Day of Judgment, you're safe. And Allah knows best."
