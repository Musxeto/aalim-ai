  "transcript": "So the first question says, when reading the Qur'an, can we make du'a directly without praising Allah and giving salutations to the Prophet ï·º? The answer is yes. When you pass by a verse where there is mentioning of Allah's mercy and forgiveness, or the description of Jannah, of Paradise, and you want to ask Allah to grant you such a thing, you simply ask Allah to grant you His mercy, His forgiveness, or to admit you to Jannah. There is no need to praise Allah or to offer salutation upon the Prophet ï·º. And the evidence is that the Prophet ï·º, when he used to pray night prayer and recite the Qur'an, whenever he passed by a verse that contained Allah's mercy, he would ask Allah for His mercy. And whenever he passed by a verse that talked about Allah's wrath, he would seek refuge in Allah from his wrath and torment. So it was not mentioned that he used to praise Allah or offer salutation upon the Prophet ï·º, which means that you can go ahead and directly ask for it."
