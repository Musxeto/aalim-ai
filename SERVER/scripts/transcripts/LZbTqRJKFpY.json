  "transcript": "NAA from the UK um when we make intention for wood for example to pray for ass and time comes and we don't intend to make W can we pray um with the same W even if we did not attend it the prophet was reported in an authentic Hadith that he performed f and with one single W and when he was asked or the companions were asked why did he do such a thing they replied so that he would not burden his um so that he would give them the permission to perform multiple prayers with the same wo with without any problem in that nowhere do we have in Islam that a particular woodo must be performed with the intention of which prayers one is going to pray so if I perform W I don't have to intend that I want to pray maybe with that W all what I have to intend is to uplift the minor ritual impurity which is done through Wu once I perform wo I am not in the state of minor ritual impurity I'm in the state of VO which qualifies me to pray as many prayers as I wish to perform um ta to read or touch the Quran to do whatever I need to do while in the state of woodoo with this single Evolution or woodoo I performed regardless of what I intended at the time as long as I intended to uplift my minor ritual impurity"
