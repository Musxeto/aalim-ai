  "title": "How should an Islamic wedding party be? (extravagance ) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother Mohammed says a hamdulillah a lot of mighty has given me enough wealth that I can afford a kind of lavish or grand wedding but I want to keep my Nika as simple as possible because the Nika that is the marriage of the Prophet was very simple sallallahu alayhi wasallam will I be a miser for not doing a grand wedding or I should go with the Sunnah also suggest me on how should be a Muslims nikka when it comes to extravagance when it's it comes to excessiveness in expenditure there is no one size that fits all it depends on the income of the individual it depends on the environment the circumstances the community the time and place so there are a number of factors that govern such issues generally speaking Allah social says eat drink but do not go into excessive expenditure well a to city folk don't waste money in a sense don't be extravagant so Allah is telling us to eat and drink but to be moderate Allah also described the believers that when they spent their expenditure is not extravagant nor its misery rather it is in between to have a big wedding this is dependent on a number of factors whether you income allows it or not whether you are calling righteous people or only people of influence and wealth you remember so many times you repeated this hadith the Prophet said that assume the worst said that the worst food is the food of walima walima is for the usually given for the marriage contract the worst food is the food of walima because those who reject it are invited to it the wealthy the people of power and fame usually they reject coming to such feasts and meals and those who would accept an answer it are not invited and these are the poor these are the people who do not have as much influence as the prior ones so this depends on also your income if a person is going to borrow if a person is going to take a chunk of what not of what's not his or not be able to provide the obligatory expenditure to his family in order to pay for such a wedding this is extravagance however one cannot say he you have to be at the rock bottom when you make such weddings in the sense that you have to pay the utmost minimum the least minimum possible in terms of the wedding hall in terms of the food in terms of means of hospitality this is not logical Allah says in the Quran say who made what allah azza wajal what allah has given us who made it haram while allah made it lawful and good man hey brahma zenit allah allah tahajud by the him in a plate or risk who is it who Allah what Allah has given us from the adornment of this life comes and says no this is Haram no this is as long as it's halal its earned by halal is spent in halal and there's no extravagance there's no problem in that however what we see nowadays is clear extravagance hotels that people pay a hundred thousand Saudi Riyals or hundred and fifty thousand etc maybe it's something within the ranges of thirty thousand dollars for one night and for food which would eventually in two-three hours turn into what you know and be flushed down the toilet and you pay this much no this is extravagance we don't say erect a tent and call people to come and eat dates and water no but be moderate don't do something that may break the heart of the poor don't do something that may get you an evil eye wow look at this where did they get this money from do something that is moderate nice presentable and utilize the money for the welfare of the newlywed couple so that they would begin a better life what is the suggestion to a Muslim nikka it should be as stated earlier it should be simple the way of the Prophet that is awesome the way of the Companions it was simple a good meal a place to gather in and maybe it's different times correct but still you have to have this moderation in mind insha'Allah"
