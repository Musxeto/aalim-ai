  "title": "Don't read Hadith Books or Quran without a Scholar??? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam Sheikh my question was, can an ordinary Muslim read the Hadith and follow it? But some Muslims say that it's necessary to learn the Hadith in the guidance of some knowledgeable person. JazakAllah This is a prevailing idea or concept where you come from brother Muhammad, unfortunately. So many people come to me and say, Sheikh our scholars say don't read the Quran. Sheikh I bought Sahih Al Bukhari and my scholars say don't read it unless you're supervised. And this is totally bogus. Allah Azza Wa Jal did not put interpreters between this knowledge and us. We're not obliged to go and seek people's blessing and barakah to read the Quran or to the books of Hadith or the books of Fiqh. Definitely we won't be able to understand it all due to our lack of knowledge. But this does not mean that we should not read it. Allah revealed the Quran for us to ponder upon it and contemplate and understand it. And these people prevent and stop people from doing so. No, go ahead brother, read the Quran, read the Tafsir, read the books of Hadith and the books of Fiqh and the books of Aqeedah. And whenever you don't understand something, you have to refer it back to the scholars. This might be 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent at times. But the vast majority of it is crystal clear and understandable inshallah."
