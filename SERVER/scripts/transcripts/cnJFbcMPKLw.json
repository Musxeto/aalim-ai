  "transcript": "Alim from Ireland Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaikumussalam I live in Ireland and I shop on the Amazon website because it's not available in Ireland so and I know when I order a product it goes to a currency exchange and I don't know when the receiver or the company gets the money that I buy from their product so it's still halal for me to actually order from that website I find no problem in buying from such websites because they tell you that this product costs $15 and they if you approve of it would take it from your credit card or from your any payment of method of payment that you agreed upon and do the exchange rate on the spot and get it over with so there's no problem in that and Allah knows best."
