  "transcript": "Yusuf from Tunisia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu My question is I live with my parents and in my room there is a portrait of me that is my portrait. I realized it was haram so I took it down. The problem is my parents' reaction wasn't good. So my mom yelled at me and she spit on me. She slapped herself. And most of the time when I refuse to do something haram, she does something that is kufr. So my question is, so what I did was I put a portrait back to reduce the evil. Is what I did correct and how to deal with such parents? First of all, it is not logical what you're saying. The way that your mother behaved means that she has mental issues or you have driven her to the verge of insanity with your behavior. Now I'm taking your word for what you're saying but if I were to speak to her, she would have probably said that this guy is too extreme, that he's driving us crazy, that he has fanatic views and we're afraid that he will join ISIS and blow up places. I don't know. So you have to first of all look into how you're talking and dealing with them. I trust that if you were to be diplomatic and kind and obedient and you know how to approach them, they wouldn't behave in such a fashion. Nevertheless, putting the portrait back again, if it was to reduce the backfire and to prevent more evil from happening, I hope that this is permissible. But whenever you want to pray, try to cover it without them seeing you and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
