  "transcript": "Aman from India. Aman. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, when we sit in I'tikaf, we have to stay awake whole 10 nights. So, unfortunately, to rest we have to sleep in the daytime. So now my question is, can you give me a direction how to balance sleep and I'tikaf? Because I always sleep after Fajr till Dhuhr, which I want to utilize in this time. Jazakum Allah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. First of all, I'tikaf, which is seclusion, is a highly recommended sunnah in the last 10 nights of Ramadan. The Prophet ﷺ observed it the most of his life in Medina and skipped it only once. So, this is the sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ. And it is a sunnah indeed to revive the nights of these last 10 nights more than the daytime. And we are humans, we have to have rest time. So, if the nighttime is more valuable than the daytime, it would be illogical to spend your nighttime sleeping and trying to do something beneficial in the daytime because the value is different. And the norm is that you sleep during the daytime from Fajr till Dhuhr. That is pretty normal as mentioned in Surah Al-Muzzammil that during the daytime you have a lot of hours of sleep if you wish. So, Allah is telling us that if you want to utilize the nighttime, which is the best thing to do when worshipping Allah, why? Because it's quiet. It is the time when the vast majority of people are asleep. And it is best for you not to show off, unlike in the daytime when everybody is looking at you. But at nighttime, everybody is asleep. When you worship Allah, you're more sincere as people are not aware of what you're doing. So, it is best for you during the last 10 nights of Ramadan to sleep during the daytime without skipping Salat, the fourth Salat, and Allah knows best. Al-Fatiha."
