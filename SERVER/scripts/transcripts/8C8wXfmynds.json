  "transcript": "Za'eem from India how are you \nShiekh I'm fine alhamdulillah   okay my question was regarding a Fatwa from \nShiekh Salih al Osaimi and Shiekh Salih Al-Fawzaan regarding Aqeedah and Manhaj so he says \nthat Aqeedah is a belief and Manhaj is   a bigger thing that is that Aqeedah and our \nBehavior work everything comes under it but   I didn't get it correctly so I want to I want \nit from you to explain it please do it for me Aqeedah deals with your belief your conviction \nso it deals with the belief in Allah the day   of judgment the Angels The Messengers The \nScriptures and the Divine decree whether good   or bad these are a Arkam Al Iman it deals with \neverything that is from the worlds of the Unseen   things that are we must believe in part of \nour conviction this is Aqeedah so anything   that deals with Allah his beautiful \nnames and attributes his lordship of   lordship the head of worship and the rest \ndeals with Aqeedah Manhaj is a new word   that was not found previously or used by the \nsalaf but it came up to end indicate that   whatever we do are etiquette or moral conduct \nour Behavior the way we deal with things is part   of our Manhaj or methodology and this may vary \nfrom one country to the other from one nation   to the other from one culture to the other so \nit is not as important as though it might have   a wider spectrum and without it following \nthe Quran and the Sunnah it has no value   so whoever says and and by the way this is a huge \nproblem nowadays everywhere you go you find sects   especially among those salafis who are \nfollowing the footsteps of the Prophet Allah   and his companions and the Tabi'een and Tabi' Al \nTabi'een yet shaytan has infiltrated some of them   so he caused them to cause a \nbig fitna dividing the Muslims   targeting certain Scholars \nstudents of knowledge or dua't   belittling them and I've seen few video clips \nrecently especially with what's happening in Qatar   about some of the Dai'ees and I I see people \njust sitting on their couch discrediting this   dai'ees discrediting this scholar this \nstudent of knowledge he's deviant he's and what about you oh no I'm I'm \nthe best of the best I'm the cream   and this is wrong so these deviant people \nthough they may seem to be following the   correct Aqeedah they take this Manhaj this is \nhow you usually say it he's on the wrong Manhaj   and they come right straight \nright from a comic book   this is not Islam this is not how we're supposed \nto deal in da'wah way yes if I if if a big student   of knowledge or Da'ia makes an error or two \nit doesn't mean I have to cross him off and   see this guy is a lunatic or he is an atheist or \nhe's a Kafir and then bring quotes from different   Scholars and make a video clip and publish it \nthis is not the way of calling people to Islam   this is the right way to divide the Muslims and \nthis is what they're doing and Allah Knows Best"
