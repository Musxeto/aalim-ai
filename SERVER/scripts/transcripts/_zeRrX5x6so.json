  "transcript": "this is mm tamim I'm from Bangladesh how can we increase our memory power and work so fast how can we memorize so fast and remember it for long is there any secret please pray for me to Allah that he gives more patience and increase my power may Allah subhana give you more SA and increase the power increase the memory now coming to your question that how can we increase our memory power how can you memorize so fast and how do you memorize for so long normally there are various techniques that you find in courses for memory and if you Google and there are many courses of how you can increase the memory there are courses like mapping and different techniques of memory but I personally feel that the best way to me Miz is the help of Allah subhana tala and there are three points which I always mentioned in my dawa training program or for success in any matters number one is the help of Allah Allah says in Surah Imran chapter 3 verse number 160 if Allah helps you then none can overcome you if Allah forsakes you who is there then who can help you so let the Believers put the Trust In Allah subhana tala so number one help of Allah trust in Allah believe in him have faith in him his help is number one for your success without his help you cannot get success you make get temporary success but not ultimate success in this world and number two Allah says in the Quran in Sur ankabut chapter number 29 verse number 69 that if you strive in his path Allah will open up his Pathways for you so if you strive and if you struggle if you do had in the way of Allah subhana tala Allah will open your Pathways so number two is after having faith in Allah you should strive and struggle you should do hard work and number three is Allah says in Surah n chapter 16:43 and Surah chapter number 21 vers number 7 if you don't know ask the person who's knowledgeable the last is the technique so number one for memory of any success is ask for Allah's help see that your Nia is very pure see that you're doing it for sake of Allah and only to gain the pleasure of Allah number two strive and struggle and number three is the technique as far as the memory is concerned there are different types of memory there is something like a temporary memory something like an immediate memory and something which is memory of the past something which is a permanent memory so normally when you memorize whether you're memorizing the Quran or whether you're memorizing a lecture or whether memorizing any matter hard work is important and depending upon Allah's help some people may read it once they may have a photogenic memory and it goes in their memory for long you know for example Imam bukari mashallah Allah had given him a photogenic memory his memory was phenomenal he didn't have to work hard like us that was Allah's help so if if you have that level of help of Allah then that is Ultimate but naturally the man was high and is and the help of Allah also was high but generally everyone should seek Allah's help number one number two strive and struggle what you have to do when you memorize of course you have to repeat that multiple times and once you repeat it few times five times six times be one sentence two sentence or three sentence whether it be few of of the Quran or maybe one verse if you keep on repeating it goes into your memory but it goes into your temporary memory so for it to be for a longer time what you have to do once you repeat it a few times now again repeat it after maybe maybe half an hour then repeat again after 2 hours then again after 5 hours the more you repeat and memorize it keeps on going deeper and deeper in your memory so if you're preparing for lecture tomorrow maybe you memorize it then again repeat it after half an hour then repeat that thing after two hours after five hours you you repeat it few times and then maybe you're able to give the lecture but after you deliver the lecture if you ask to deliver the same lecture after one year you won't be able to do it leave us one year after one month you can't do it even after one week you may not be able to do it because it was only in your temporary memory so what you have to do after you have delivered the lecture you have to keep on repeating it or if you giving a lecture again after a month again you you memorize it so if you want it to be part of your permanent memory then you have to DOA you have to do revision and that's what is done by the people who the Quran if you memorize the Quran you know if you memorize the full Quran you called Quran that means you memorize the full Quran by heart but if you really analyze most of the that are there in the world there are millions of ofas but all of them cannot repeat the Quran in one go or they may memorize the Quran they memorize a few verses then maybe a few suras then maybe a j maybe two J the by they keep on memorizing the full Quran 30 ju then they may forget the first J or the second or third ju unless they do Mah so the different techniques of memorizing if you keep on memorizing going ahead and don't revise your past memory you will forget it so what they do when you memorize a few pages when you keep on going ahead you even keep on revising what you had memorized yesterday or what you memorized a week back or what you memorized a month back of course the more you keep on memorizing if the volume keeps on increasing the juy memorize keep on increasing to memorize everything is difficult so then you have to divide yourself in memorizing new vers of the Quran as well as in doing revision a time will come that the time for revision is more than the time you required to memorize the new verses so if you do a proper system and once you finish the Quran normally when a human being completes memorizing the Quran he cannot repeat the Quran from first page to the last page no that's a misconception of course he has to DOA so if he spends time maybe two years in memorizing the Quran some people take three years some people finish in one year the faster you memorize the faster you forget there are courses where we are in a school we will memorize the Quran in two months it's possible but if you finish in two months and you stop after one month you cannot repeat the Quran so even if you finish the Quran in 2 months if you spend about 10 or 12 hours a day a crash course your mura will take multiple months or years so it's the same thing you memorize in two months and you division for few years or you memorize in few years and take additional few years for revision so the main secret of memory is that you keep on repeating till the time it goes in your permanent memory now most of the Muslims majority they know Sur faat because Sur FAA has become a part of the memory because Muslims are supposed to pray five times a day and if you pray five times a day you have to read minimum 17 ra with with 20 ra so 20 times if you're repeating in the day if you wake up that Muslim in the middle of his night who's been praying regularly not a Muslim who doesn't pray if a person who prays regularly or even if he prays even once a day if he's praying for many years if you wake him up from the middle of his sleep and you ask him to recite Sur faat he can do it easily because that has gone into his permanent memory even in permanent memory there are levels deep down permanent memory you know or not deep down same way if you ask him to recite maybe SAS even that may be part of his permanent memory matter I've repeat surlas many times but if he doesn't recite a Surah maybe once a month he may not be able to repeat in the middle of his sleep but with concentration he can repeat it because it's part of his permanent memory but requires concentration there may be certain things he memorized just recently unless he doesn't do Mah he cannot repeat it so that's the reason there are different types of memory and I know that I have given several talks in my life I know there are these few talks maybe these five or six talks you ask me to get up from my sleep and give a talk I can give a talk without revision even if there are 50 verses of the Quran 100 vers of the Quran because those talks are part of my permanent memory deep down there are other talks I have to revise maybe for 15 minutes some talks I may have to revise for one hour some maybe two hours those talks which I give RAR I have to revise for 3 hours or 4 hours so every talk of mine is not part of my permanent memory part of the talk maybe but not everything and the more goes in your permanent memory it helps you in the question answer session in the question answer session you may not have notes you cannot have notes in front of you question answer session live so when you're giving a talk you can memorize your talk and deliver the talk but question answer session is something you aren't aware okay here because we having question answer on the WhatsApp Etc you know it's being filtered by my staff and so some of the question questions which I've received before from my staff of course that I seen so I can prepare if I want and some of the questions I take live from the Facebook from the YouTube those questions which I take live are new questions but normally when we are handling an open question in public we are not aware of a single question we can assume what may come and we can prepare for ourself but we don't know so that time if you have many lectures which are part of your permanent memory that helps you in the question session therefore tell all my students when you give a talk don't carry notes if you don't carry notes you keep on repeating it becomes part of your memory because in a question and session you cannot carry notes and search for the answer it has to be from your memory so if you have 50 100 talks as a part of a permanent memory some deep down some superficial but if it's part of permanent memory then that helps you in the question session so as far as the formula for memory number one is help of Allah you pray to Allah ask Allah to give you good memory pray to Allah that you remember you can pray in your Salah number two is hard work you strive you struggle number three is technique see to it that you keep on doinga you keep on revising help of Allah hard work revising till it becomes part of memory and if it becomes part of your permanent memory deep down it will be for long and inshah can even be forever hope they answer the question"
