  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I was reading the Tafseer and I was reading about the sacrifices of the Sahabi and how much they did for Islam and for the Prophet ﷺ So I was feeling emotional and I wanted to make Dua for them but I don't know what Dua I should make for the Sahabi For the Prophet ﷺ I can say Salam on him or ask for Maqam-e-Mehmood but for the Sahabi I don't know what Dua I should make If I ask for their forgiveness or should I ask for them for Jannah but they are already in Jannah because they are the companions of the Prophet ﷺ So that I wanted to ask about JazakAllah Khair What is Jazak? First of all, we know that those whom the Prophet ﷺ named to be in Jannah are in Jannah So Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, Abdur Rahman Ibn Awf, Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas, Abu Ubaidah Amir Ibn Jarrah, Zubair Ibn Al Awwam, Talha Ibn Ubaidillah And the son of Abdullah Ibn Zaid, I forgot his name, the narrator of the Hadith, SubhanAllah, I skipped his name He is the brother-in-law of Umar Ibn Khattab, these ten are in Jannah, Bilal is in Jannah because there is a Hadith stating that They are in Jannah, now the companions in total are in Jannah but not every individual of them we can confirm that he is in Jannah But in totality, so what Dua should we do? We can say Allahumma Ghafir Lahum, O Allah forgive them O Allah be pleased with them, as mentioned in the Quran And any such Dua, Allah raised their ranking in Paradise, would do, so there is no problem in making Dua for them Or, better more, make Dua for yourself, O Allah make me on the Day of Judgment in the same rank of the companions To be with them, to be able to meet them and mix with them, because I love them for your sake And for what they had done to our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in supporting him This would be a better option, and Allah knows best"
