  "transcript": "way of behavior and among the greatest of all favors and blessings of Allah upon us that calamities do not continue, they must end. Imagine how many calamities have passed by you in your life and you remember oh in that year this happened, I lost my job, I lost my wealth, one of the business partners cheated me and took off my money, I was afflicted by this, I was incarcerated, now Alhamdulillah everything is fine. Calamities do not continue, they must come to an end and this is why Allah says in the Quran, So verily with hardship there is relief, verily with hardship there is relief, two reliefs with one hardship, so definitely you will win if you are patient."
