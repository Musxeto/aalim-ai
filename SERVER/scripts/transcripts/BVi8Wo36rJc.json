  "title": "ðŸ†• Is a daughter a GUEST after marriage and does not have the same rights? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The first question is from a sister. She says, does a daughter become guest at her parental home after marriage? My parents call me a guest whenever I go to my parental home. Islamically, does the daughter hold same right which she had to be to go and be like the same which she had before marriage in her parental home? The question is, what's the difference? Whether they call you a guest or not? And what are the rights they are depriving you of? Basically, there's nothing. Most likely, they honor you more. They would not allow you to participate in house chores as before and would ask your other siblings to do the job as you are there only temporarily for few hours or few days, maybe a week or two, and then you go back to your husband's house. So, they honor you more. Not that they are depriving you of your rights, unless you are insisting on sleeping in your same old bedroom on your bed that you've abandoned for four or five years because you're married with your husband. That is not logical. It's not logical to ask your sister to evacuate the room for your sake. You're just here for a week or two and you want to change everything as it used to be? No, this is not fair. Other than that, whatever they're telling you that you're a guest, meaning that you're honored and you're not expected to work and clean and cook as you used to before, and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. So, don't be too sensitive and spoil things accordingly."
