  "transcript": "ala from France yes I have a problem like um on the situation whereby my younger sisters are married or the Muslim sisters in their parents house there are some Muslim sisters that are still in their parents house and so I don't have anything I I don't I'm not married and I am not in my parents house so Satan keeps justifying my situation by violating their honor criticizing them and VI m b mouthing their half for me to feel better than them so and I noticed that people don't really like like it like even so even the Muslim sisters are a little bit distan away from me and it is normal because I keep getting this whpr of violating their honors or their parents honors or keep criticizing them that they are sinful they are with parents that deals with sueras there with parents that deals with reers or are sinful just for me to be to feel better in my own skin and this is this is a little bit this this is this is a sign of arrogance just to be fine with your own skin does not justify you labeling people slandering them looking down at them and trying to justify your own weakness or shortcomings and uh uh flaws by criticizing them this is not permissible the prophet said he who has an aunts weight of arrogance in his heart will not enter paradise and this is why the salaf the way they look at themselves is always resenting themselves compared to others but they don't show it to the others so if I see someone who's young I would envy him and say mashallah he's young he did not make all the sins that I have done and when I see someone who's older than me I say mashallah he's older than me he has much more Good Deeds than me this is the way we balance things but I don't go around telling people listen I have sins and I don't have good deeds no this is for me how to look at myself to go and look down at people and resent them they deal in riba they live with their parents they do this they do that so that I would be fine with myself this is totally Haram"
