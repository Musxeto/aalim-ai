  "title": "Cheating in Online Exam? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The next question that we are including is from a youth, from a young boy. Basically he's saying is that these days in our school everything is online and during the tests, kids, other kids, they cheat and they get better marks. Does this make cheating in these tests halal for me? True wrongs don't make a right and when all the people on earth decide to worship idols, Muslims stay steadfast and only worship Allah Azza Wa Jal. So if they all cheat, this is the mistake of the school, this is a mistake of the administration that does not take heed in ensuring that none of this takes place and hence you are not allowed to be with them if they sin. You have to exclude yourself from such a behavior. A Muslim does not cheat and a Muslim does not lie."
