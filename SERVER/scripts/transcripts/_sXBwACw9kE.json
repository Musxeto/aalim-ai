  "title": "Mandatory to fast whole 10 Days of Dhul Hijja? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abu Rayyan from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikum Sheikh, my question is, is it mandated to fast the whole 10 days of Dhul Hijjah, the whole first 10 days? Jazak Allah Khairan Of course, when we say it is sunnah to fast the first 10 days of Dhul Hijjah, due to the hadith where the Prophet ﷺ said, there are no days of the year better in good deeds more than these 10 days. And the Prophet ﷺ, as in the hadith, the other hadith, he used to fast these 10 days. Of course, this is called in Arabic, At-Taghleeb. Which means that we refer to the vast majority, not to the actual 10 days, because everybody knows that the 10th day is the day of Eid. And it is prohibited. And even if you fast it, it won't be accepted. It's invalid. So everyone knows that this 10th day is not included in fasting, but it's included in every other good deeds. So is it mandated? Is it mandatory? Is it obligatory? The answer is no, of course not. The only obligation is to fast the days of Ramadan. But it is highly recommended, beyond imagination, to do good deeds in these 10 days, including fasting. With the exception of the day of Eid, of course, and Allah knows best."
