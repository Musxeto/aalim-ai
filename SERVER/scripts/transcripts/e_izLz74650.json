  "transcript": "what are the various advantages and disadvantages of various means uh on a path to giving da to non Muslims each of these means has the advantage or disadvantage for example as far as the retention is concerned today scientific research tells us that when a person reads something a common human being retains 10% of what he has read when a person hears something he retains a approximately 20% of what he has heard when he sees something that's a visual he retains on average 30% of what he has seen and if he hears and sees together that is a video audio visual together video tape or a CD you know video CD on average a human being retains 50% so in terms of retention the maximum power is the video audio video together then is only visual then comes hearing and the last is only reading as far as the advantage and disadvantage is concerned the print media though retention is 10% it is portable you can carry in the train carry in the bus carry in your car can carry it anywhere it's easy for transportation but at a time only one person reads it or sometime someone is peeping maybe one or two that's it three but the reach per thing is limited one at a time two at a time maximum but it's portable you can kite anyway and it is important will always remain important the next is the audio media in which the portability is less as compared to the print media as compared to the book or the pamphlet but yet you have Walkman that can be taken you can hear it in the cassette in the car and the Walkman but at a time either one can hear individually or group of people can hear it 5 10 if it's a gathering a few hundred can hear on the radio broadcast station Millions can hear as far as the video media is concerned again it's less portable as compared to audio you know there are dis man that have come out there are know small television screens in the car in the buses in the planes in terms of portability it is less but in terms of fridge it is much higher you know it can reach cable TV satellite trangle millions and lastly the internet internet again individual person has to go on that site that to you require an internet connection you require a computer it has its own limitation but many people can access your site it's easy for anyone to open a website you don't require any money it's very cheap open IT person can have website so you can spread information very easily it has advantage and disadvantage any person who wants to slander or speak false thing easily can do it otherwise print media to print a book requires money to produce audio cassette or a video cassette takes money here anyone without any Finance he can write anything any nonsense so it has disadvantage Advantage the person who wants to spread Islam also you can spread it so you have to make the right choice between the two so these are the various advantage and the advantage of the meeting"
