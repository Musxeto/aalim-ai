  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Before sleeping, I cut my hands together and blow into them and recite the last three khuls, then wipe it all over my body for three sets, just as the Prophet ï·º used to do during the night. What I wanted to ask you was, how many times are we supposed to say the in the Basmala? For example, after cupping my hands together and blowing into them, is it correct to say in the first set, I got your question. I got your question, Muhammad. First of all, saying is a sunnah. If you skip it, there is no problem. It has no impact. If you want to say it, you only say it once in the nine times you recite these surahs. So set of three, set of three, set of three. You only say it in the very beginning, that's it. Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim is highly recommended to be recited nine times, once before each surah. But if you again skip it, this has no impact and your action is valid, your recitation is valid, but it's best to recite al-Basmala nine times. So, only once. This is recommended. If you skip it, there's no problem. And Allah azza wa jal knows best."
