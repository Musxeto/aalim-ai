  "title": "Whoever abandons Salah is a kafir so how to enter Islam again, take Shahada or start praying again?",
  "transcript": "my question is I've heard you in a discussion with dr. Bilal Philips say that if a person intentionally abandons this Allah then they will not they will no longer be a Muslim so I'm wondering if a person intends to become a Muslim again do they have to say the Shahada or do they have to just start praying salat again Romar from Australia says that you said that whoever abandons salat intentionally is kafir and he's referring to the debate which is known in on YouTube as the grid the great debate which was conducted in the Green Lane Masjid in Birmingham about seven seven six seven years ago and I was fortunate to sit with dr. Amin ability' lips to debate on this issue in the Masjid and it was a beautiful scientific argument where he presented his case that a person who abandoned Salah cannot exit Islam and I presented the other opinion and if you would noticed if you watched the whole series Oh mark you will find that I didn't say that a person who abandoned Salah is a kafir it was the Prophet Allah saw Sarah so the verses of the Quran and the hadith of the Prophet erase Auto saram clearly states that the pledge between us and them is salat whoever abandons it is a kafir in sorry honeymoon I'm a Muslim banal Marie was Shirky I will go free Turkish a lot between man and disbelief or shirk is abandoning salat and in the Shonan the Prophet said from enterica hoffa could cover whoever abandons it he's a kafir and I explained in that debate it you can see it's on YouTube is for free alhamdulillah you can see that I have stated that this is the ruling in Islam which is theoretical meaning that whoever does this is a kafir likewise when I say whoever prostrates to an idol is a mushrik you don't have any disagreement with that is it not true and you would say no III believe in that so if I would say to you I he I know where you're going with your question and this is not a true story which took place between mmm chef in mmm it when in ma'am I met said that whoever burned and saw as a kafir so in my chef he asked him so okay if this kafir wants to accept Islam what should he do say la ilaha mohammed rasoolallah he said yes so he already says Leila hamdullah so how did you take him out this is not authentic this is not a true story but I know where you're coming from let me ask you this if someone says that I don't believe that drinking hammer dunking wine in toxicants is prohibited I believe it's Helen what would you say so no this is qu for whoever says this is a kafir since the okay now this guy wants to accept Islam what should he do you say say let alone hamdullah Touche the guy already says Lila I'm the Rasul Allah but the thin and fine lining here the silver lining is that when he said I don't believe in toxicants Haram he nullified la ilaha illallah because part of la ilaha ilallah belief is that you follow what allah commanded you to to falsify a verse in the quran then you're not a Muslim anymore likewise who abandons a lot totally theoretically he is a kafir now practically it's a different issue altogether because we cannot give takfeer to an individual so Ali doesn't pray we know that whoever does not praise a kafir we cannot combine this equation to say whoever does not pray as a kafir Ali doesn't pray the conclusion and the result is Adi is a kafir no we have to ensure that the conditions are fulfilled in Ali that is not ignorant that he is not forced to do this that he doesn't have any interpretation among the other things and that there are no obstacles preventing us from assuming or giving him takfeer so Adi doesn't pray or he's a kafir no there's an obstacle okay what is the obstacle that he is mentally challenged he's insane oh I didn't know that though now you know there are many other reasons so in a nutshell I think yeah Annie I've answered your question practically speaking we can't give takfeer to people who do not pray until we ensure and we are certain that they have fulfilled the conditions that they are not willing to pray and this is what Sheikh al-islam is seven taymiyah may Allah be pleased may Allah have mercy on his soul set at the end at the end of this discussion he said that if a man was caught by the authorities and he was told to pray he said I don't want to pray I believe that prayer is one of the pillars of Islam but I don't want to pray and they keep on selling him while he's in jail we're gonna chop your head off pray should know I'm not gonna pray I believe in Allah I believe in them professor but I'm not gonna pray then he sees the executioner coming with his big blade and he's tied and is getting ready to chop his head off and they give him the final warning okey come and praise and no I'm not gonna pray in tamiya says this guy once executed he should be thrown in the desert he's not a Muslim no one is so defiant and adamant on not praying no one else is gonna die because of that except that a person is not a Muslim Allah knows best"
