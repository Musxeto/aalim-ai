  "title": "Can I love a NonMuslim but hate their Kufr? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sheikh my question is regarding Al-Wala and Al-Bara. So we know that we must love Muslims for their faith and hate them for their sins. The same way can we love disbelievers who are not family or relatives or wives for their goodness and kindness while hating them for their disbelief? No problem in that at all. Otherwise how would I marry a Christian wife that would be the mother of my children? I love her for worldly matters. I love her for her good looks and for her good cooking and taking care of me and of my children. But I hate her kufr and disbelief. This is no problem in that none whatsoever."
