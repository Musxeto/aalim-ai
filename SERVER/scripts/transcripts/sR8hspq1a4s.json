  "transcript": "is the ex-husband obliged to do that the answer is no [Music] israel from belgium so my question is uh a woman is divorced for the third time and she has uh 10 months baby from him and uh she is given the custody and she doesn't have income because she's divorced now she has to go back to her parents so the question is um does the ex-husband oblige to buy her the flight ticket and also like can you explain what is the rights of the divorced woman with the child so the custody the custody is with the with the woman or with the husband with the woman okay i would answer inshallah from belgium she says um a woman was divorced for the last and third time so who's obliged to buy her a ticket to go back home is the ex-husband obliged to do that the answer is no this is the islamic ruling because once a woman is divorced for the third time there is no allowance there is no provision from the ex-husband there is no shelter to be provided for her and this is well established in the sunnah so the riddha period for the one who's divorced the first time or the second time is three monthly cycles and within these three monthly cycles she must be provided by her husband who just divorced her with a house to live in with food medicine etc all what she needs to sustain a normal noble life if she was divorced for the third time immediately this bond is broken and it's over so he's not obliged to give her anything nor to buy her the ticket and allah azza knows best but if she wants to live somewhere else if she wants to go to her country and she has the right of custody this is a an issue of dispute among scholars the vast majority say that a divorced woman a separated woman mother who has the right of custody cannot take the child out of the country where the husband is because this is where they were married this is the uh place where he lives so they should stay there some scholars say that this is not a fixed ruling it depends on the husband it depends on the woman it depends on the welfare of the child maybe they live in belgium and it's not a muslim country and she's going back to a muslim country where the child would be raised as a muslim and practice islam freely unlike some other countries so this is judge case by case scenario and not a one size that fits all"
