  "title": "Scratched head more than 3 times with the same hand, is my prayer valid? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "zeyneb says I was praying Feder and I scratched my head more than three times with one hand I learned that if I if a person scratches themselves more than three times with one hand in one posture it invalidates the prayer do I have to repeat the prayer first of all this is an issue of dispute and I know that different schools of thought may say such a rule but as Muslims we relate to the Quran and to the Sunnah because Allah Azza WA JAL sent these the Quran and the Sunnah for us as means of guidance and Allah told us that whenever we have a dispute among ourselves that we relay it to the Quran and to the Sunnah so if you reach out and look at the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam you will find that what it was mentioned of movement three times with one hand in the same posture nullifies your prayer is totally bogus it's totally unrelated to Islam the only hadith that may relate to it is the man who did not pray well a man came and had a little sigh he prayed two Rakas then came to the prophet and said assalam o alikum and the Prophet replied party from Salam go back and pray for you have not prayed so the the guy goes again prays to rock hasn't come back gives Salam the prophet replies to the Salam and say go back you have not prayed and the man does it for the third time and the same response is from the Prophet as a Sam the man says I give up teach me or prophet of Allah for I do not know how to pray other than what you had seen me do so the Prophet teaches have scholars say that this man mistake was that he was not easygoing in prayer he did not have tranquility a friend sent me an a wats app message today showing me how people pray in some places like in Turkey in Indonesia and the imam is reciting the fatiha and you can only as an Arab understand baleen that's it and he is like from 0 to 100 less than 2.1 seconds even faster than a tesla what is this this prayer is invalid and the prayer of those behind it is invalid because he's just doing this he's not at all having any tranquility in salat this is the same to the man's prayer in front of the Prophet Isis Salam now having said that it is essential that when you do Recor you stay calm in record position you don't do this you have to do subhanAllah be a Lim and you send me Allah Allah Muhammad and you stay calm so it's a fraction a second or two maybe but if you do this this is not prayer it is invalid what about the movement of three times this is baseless there is nothing in the Quran the Sunnah that backs it up on the contrary he was reported so many times that the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to move more than that so in the sahi he once came out and prayed with omama mint i will ask his grand daughter and he carried her while praying and whenever he went for bowing or prostrating he would place her on the ground when he ever stood up he picked her up and carried her how many movements were there it's a lot so what the people are telling you is not wrong now is it allowed to scratch your head it depends if I am in my prayer and I get this bitching in my shoulder or in my hand if I don't do it it's going to annoy me until the end of the salaat which means that I will not concentrate in my salat at all in this case it becomes recommended if not mandatory to just scratch it and move on so that it would not distract you from salat imagine that the Prophet erase a lot some told us not to pray when we have the urge to answer the call of nature why I can pray I'm not gonna do it on myself yes but the Prophet the Prophet I said I wanted you to pray with full concentration and tranquility it is prohibited for you to eat to pray while the food is being served and you're hungry no postpone and delay the prayer eat first so likewise if you have this feeling of Danny you have to scratch yourself it's itchy then there's no problem having said that there are people who get this itchiness of salat in normal cases they have no problem just once they commence and begin their prayer they start playing with the beers playing with their key holders fixing their garments like this throughout the salat now this is an obsession this is wrong even if we say that for necessities you may move but this is not a necessity some of the brothers will line the for records or what he does with his right hand is this while he's praying in ruku he's doing this only in sujood maybe because it doesn't fit he puts his hands on the ground the minute he sits up or rises up he does this again and again he's not aware of it definitely he is not even in the Masjid with us he's somewhere else but Japan has overwhelmed him to the extent that he's doing this may Allah protect us all"
