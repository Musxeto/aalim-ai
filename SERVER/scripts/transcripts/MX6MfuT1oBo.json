  "transcript": "real from bangladesh uh can we force our friends to go to the masjid with us i've asked real but i could not get a proper answer how do i force my friends to go to the masjid force means that i have to have a gun to point at them a sword a stick if i'm their boss i would threaten them to fire them if they don't go to pray to the masjid but if they're my peers they're my friends they're my buddies i cannot force them i can invite them i can encourage them sometimes i can leverage on them by saying that guys if you don't pray with me i'm not gonna hang out with you anymore i can't hang out with people who don't pray this is a form of arm twisting but it's not forcing so can we do some something like that yes but can i force them at gunpoint or force them with physical forced answers no i have no uh right to do any of this um ariane from india how can someone be a half of a half is a description to someone who memorizes the quran how can i memorize the quran there is no one size that fits all it differs from one person to the other some people i know would read one page of the quran repeat it two or three times and they've memorized it other people need to write the page of the quran two three times and they memorize it some people would need to recite it recitation 50 times and then memorize it so you must look at what is more convenient for your memorization you have to take a friend or more to revise to one another because doing it on your own usually is not successful you tend to lose steam after few weeks if not few days but when you have someone committed to you and with you you will go a long way insha'allah and you have to memorize a portion and revise a bigger portion every day because the more days passed the more you've memorized and there's no use of memorizing it without revising it because it disappears very quickly and you need to accommodate what you have memorized in order not to forget it and allah knows best"
