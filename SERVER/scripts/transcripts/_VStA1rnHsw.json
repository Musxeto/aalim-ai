  "title": "My husband lives abroad, must I live with my inlaws in his absence? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "fatima says my husband lives in saudi arabia and i live in india with my in-laws i do not want to stay here in the absence of my husband but i live here just because my husband said so what's the ruling regarding this can I go and stay at my parents house without my husband's permission Fatima this is a complicated scenario because originally unlike what the people in the subcontinent want or like to hear a woman a wife in Islam deserves a separate accommodation this is her right in all books of law and this legitimate accommodation is identified by a room a kitchenette in a bathroom that's it it doesn't have to be a mansion it doesn't have be to be a spacious apartment though it's that would be a plus but this is her right in Islam the vast majority of the people in the subcontinent marry to bring a new servant to their mother and sisters she's on who cooks in cleans and why would she do such a thing she was living honorably within her parents house why would she move what is the cost if she's marrying mr. Olympia maybe if she's marrying someone who's as rich as Warren Buffett maybe he's neither handsome nor rich nor a knowledgeable share so what's the compensation for giving up her rights nothing but to be a servant a maid and to be abused on top of that not appreciated by everyone in the house this is Haram this is unfair so it is your right faatima to get such an accommodation but if you give up your right because you love your husband and you stay with him in your in-laws house providing that there is no free mixing in such a joint family it is totally prohibited even if your husband wants it that you live in a house where your brother brothers-in-law roam freely and sometimes I get complaints lots at times of brothers-in-law barging in the bedroom of their sister-in-law without knocking without asking because this is their house they don't respect their privacy this is a serious issue no man would accept this to happen to his wife he can be a goat he can be a sheep he cannot be a man so if this is the case you're not allowed to live in such environment this is haram environment to have such free mixing now if your husband is out of the country six months maybe a year working to earn money why are you staying in your in-laws house the one who you are supposed to serve who's your husband is not there and if there is none Muharram is coming in and out or living in the house definitely you must not be there you have all the right to go and live with your parents if your husband does not allow you to do that you do not have to obey Him you're not obliged to obey Him he's not there and he's not providing you with a legitimate Islamic environment to live in and hence you can leave and go to your parents house however you have to weigh the pros and cons and present it to him diplomatically but firmly that either you provide me with a separate accomodation where I can have my privacy with my children or then I will have to go and live with my parents until you come back"
