  "transcript": "Ahna from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam. If one has mandatory charity, can he donate in funds collected for people of Palestine or flood affected people, would it suffice? What do you mean by mandatory charity? Say he like owed somebody money but he cannot like pay it back to him directly, so it's mandatory for him to pay this 500. Yes, yes he definitely can allocate the money that he wants to cleanse his wealth from. He's not getting reward, he has to and he's obliged to return the money to X who he borrowed it from, not the Twitter, an individual. So if he's unable to find him or if he does, he's going to be put in jail because of that or for any other reason. This amount of money, the 500, he has to dispose of to cleanse his wealth because it's not lawfully his and giving it to the Muslims in Palestine would be one of the greatest things he would ever do. Though he's not going to be rewarded but they need our help. We have to stand by them because this is an issue of life or death, this is an identity, this is religion, this is Jannah or hell. So yes, or to the affected people of floods, Muslims who've been devastated with floods or natural causes and Allah knows best."
