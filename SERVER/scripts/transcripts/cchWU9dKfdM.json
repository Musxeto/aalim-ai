  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh So Sheikh is it permissible to use the word,   Marhoom before the deceased person's name for \nexample, Marhoom Fulan, Barak Allahu Feek. The word Marhoom has two meanings, one that he \nis already forgiven and Allah has Mercy over him,   Wa Feekum so you're giving your \ntestimony, Like Al Maghfoor lah. They use this word the one who has been forgiven, \nAl Marhoom means the one Allah has mercy upon,   so to testify that this deceased has been forgiven   or Allah has his mercy upon him is wrong, \nand usually no one at all intends this,   the second meaning is that he is Marhoom \nthat Allah has mercy upon him, we wish, he is   Maghfoor lahu that Allah has forgiven his \nsins we wish, so we say this adjective or   description as a form of dua meaning may Allah \nhave mercy upon Him, may Allah forgive his sins,   not that we testify that he has been forgiven \nas this is something that nobody ever thinks of   and Allah knows best, so is it permissible to say \nit? The answer is yes no problem in saying that."
