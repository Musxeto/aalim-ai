  "transcript": "Hamza from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I've been like suffering like repeating my shahada so it's just these two things so my first thing is it's imitating the kuffar it's like kuffar and also basically I do like a lot of things when I'm playing soccer as a goalkeeper I kind of predict where the soccer ball is going to go I was wondering, could you give me like a general ruling on what counts as fortune telling and what like is it permissible to like act on things that you think will happen in the future? Hamza, first of all Islam is certainty so anyone asking you are you a Muslim? you would say definitely do you have any doubts? Nope I'm definitely a Muslim so this is certainty and the rule is permitted by doubt now whenever you get intrusive thoughts saying that this is shirk this is kuffar, you committed shirk or kuffar we say do you have proof? do you have certainty that you did so? if the answer is no then you just grab it and toss it in the trash can because doubtful things do not have an impact on certainty so thinking that I did this then I'm a kafir no, imitating the kuffar depends on what you're imitating in them if you imitate the kuffar in going to churches in going to temples in worshipping their idols in sharing their rituals in their beliefs, such imitation is kuffar, no doubt but if someone is imitating the kuffar in their customs in their traditions someone is celebrating Christmas this is for the Christians yeah I know but it's fun or celebrating the New Year's Eve again why are you doing it? well I could pick a girl or two it's fun, it's lots of booze and having fun and listening to music this is haram a major sin, but it's not kuffar there's no conviction related to it so I hope this answers your question and Allah knows best"
