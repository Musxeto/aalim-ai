  "title": "Should we have patience instead of making Dua for an illness? Hadith of black woman who had seizures",
  "transcript": "uh brother from bangladesh i read a hadith about a black woman who had epilepsy so she came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and told her that she suffers from epilepsy and during fits her body is exposed so she asks prophet salallahu to suffocate for her and he replied that if you wish you can endure it patiently and you'll be rewarded with jannah or if you wish i shall suffocate so i wanted to know that does this hadith indicate that someone who has similar disease like even incontinence for example so if it isn't cured okay ahead of question has been interrupted but it's understood if i have a chronic disease should i not ask allah azzawajal no of course you should ask allah who said that you shouldn't ask allah but the woman came to the prophet sallam asking him to make dua for her and he gave her the option of two things either he makes dua for her and allah will cure her there's no problem in that this is the worldly level which all of us want but if she were not to ask the prophet allah for dua rather she makes dua herself then that would be better for her reward and allah would grant her for every uh seizure she gets so the woman weighed the pros and cons and said to herself no i'd rather the prophet not make dua for me in order to gain the reward that allah azzawajal is preserving and keeping for me but o prophet of allah i have an extra request due to these epilepsy and and seizures when i fall on the ground i may be exposed so pray to allah that i don't be exposed not that allah would cure my epilepsy so the prophet prayed for her so there are two different things when we are in need of healing and the cure for our illnesses we are prescribed to make rookia we are prescribed to say that we are prescribed to ask allah azzawajal there's no problem in that going to someone else would be like the hadith of those 70 000 who would enter paradise without accountability or any torment providing they have full trust in allah they don't ask others for rukia they you know the the other things in the hadith and allah knows best you"
