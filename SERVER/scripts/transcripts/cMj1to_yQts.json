  "title": "Can't stop watching movies & listening to songs, if I sing kufr words w/out knowing meaning, sinful?",
  "transcript": "We have Tanveer from Bangladesh. Tanveer. Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum. Salamu Alaikum. Sheikh, I can't stop watching movies, songs, etc. And sometimes I also say something, kufr words, without knowing its meaning. Am I sinful? If you're asking about watching movies and songs, of course you're sinful. That is a no-brainer. As for the kufr words that you say without knowing their meaning, no, you're not kafir for saying them because it requires conviction and knowing the meaning. But you're sinful for parroting and saying things just because people say it. Watching movies and listening to songs is your test from Allah. You have the right to choose whatever you like, knowing that your choice would identify whether you will go to Jannah or to hellfire. So if you say, I can't stop watching movies and listening to songs, it's no problem. But you should know the end result would be going to hell, being accountable, and getting the punishment and torment that was made for such sins. If you manage to curb your desire and win and succeed, then the great reward awaits you in Jannah. May Allah make me and you among those who go to Jannah. you"
