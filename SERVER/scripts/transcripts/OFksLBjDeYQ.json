  "title": "Ruling on reciting Surah Yasin after Fajr & Surah Al Waqia for Poverty? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem-JAL",
  "transcript": "insha the uk he says what's the ruling on reading yaseen after fajr unfortunately a lot of the practices in the subcontinent are not according to the sunnah or based on either fabricated hadiths from or from weak hadiths and this is widely spread in the subcontinent and also in some countries of arabia surat yasin is a great chapter of the quran but has no authentic thing in its regard that requires us to recite nothing special about it that we should recite it some scholars say that it is recommended to recite it when someone is on his dying bed he's just about to die we recite it because there is a lot of mentioning of paradise and what allah has reserved for the righteous and the believers of blessings and favors in in there but there is not nothing authentic some people consider this to be a habit that every fajr we must recite yasin every day we must recite and they say that suratul whoever recites it would not be poor and this is totally not true and we know not thousands or hundreds we know millions of muslims who recite it every single day and they are beyond the lines of poverty so it is not realistic nor logical to believe and follow and say and do things unless it's authentic and this is why this is what our da'wah stands on quran authentic sunnah with the understanding of their favorite three generations of tabi's of the companions the tabernacle we are the best with this methodology because you can't go wrong no one can say that ah yeah what about ali did was wrong what the the tabi the tabein did and they all agreed upon yeah i think now is is is better than before this is all bogus i met a brother the other day and he was trying to convince me that the collection of hadith is not solid and that we have to focus on the quran and nothing but the quran and so i said to him what are you talking about the collection of the hadith had many flaws this and that it's obvious that this guy doesn't have proper knowledge structural knowledge so i i didn't want to go into details because that would have taken the whole afternoon and i asked him one simple question which was a true really cold shower i could see it in his eyes i said ahi with all due respect for the past 15 centuries from the time of the prophet sam till date show me one single scholar real scholar who said what you have said that don't rely on the quran the hadith only rely on the quran and the guy was in shock and awe he couldn't speak he had a pause then started to stutter i said if all these great scholars of islam over the past 1500 years managed to live with the fact that the quran is explained completed and commented upon by the sunnah of the prophet sam which is also preserved by allah azzawajal like the quran was preserved can't you be like them wouldn't that fit you as it fitted them and this is what we have to always consider that don't follow what is weak or fabricated don't follow dubious scholars who want fame and glory and who are not known to be real scholars follow those who follow the quran and the sunnah the authentic with the understanding of the self"
