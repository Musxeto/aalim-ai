  "transcript": "Ahmed from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh if someone fall, if someone did some sin and only one sin, should he remain regretting all his life for that sin or he should move on from that whether it is some big sin or any sin? Repentance is something that is with us till the day we die. Now there is a difference between repenting and feeling despair or becoming depressed because part of the repentance is to be fearful of Allah Azza Wa Jal while as well being hopeful in Allah's accepting our repentance. So it is something that you need to balance between the hope and the fear of Allah Azza Wa Jal. But to do a sin, repent, feel remorseful and then forget about it as if you did not do anything and feel that, oh I am totally pure and innocent and I have nothing to worry about. And when the sin is mentioned or you remember it or reflect upon it, you find it to be normal as if you did nothing. No, this is wrong and Allah knows best."
