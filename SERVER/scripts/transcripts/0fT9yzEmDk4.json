  "transcript": "we also say this beautiful Dua Allah in the morning we say Allah in the evening we switch we say Allah is the same in the morning we say in the evening we say translation in the morning we say o Allah by your leave we have reached the morning and by your leave we have reached the evening switch it in the evening so you say oh Allah by your leave we have reached the evening and by your leave we have reached the morning and then it goes on to be the same buy or leave we live and die this is unchanged in both morning and evening but the conclusion in the morning you say and unto you is our resurrection and in the evening you say and unto you is our return what does this cement in US it cements that this is our inevitable destination This is Our Fate we are born to die we are born to die nobody lives forever the Jinn the humans they all die so once you have this as a way of life once you live knowing that you're about to die do you think you will be able to steal to kill to lie to cheat to harm others to neglect your obligations not to worship Allah do you think you're going to skip prayers or fasting Ramadan or not giving zakat on time no way because you know that you're about to die and your death can be seconds away from now there are so many videos being circulated of Scholars and and guys giving an honoration a narration or a speech and while doing it they die people praying in the Masjid they die did any one of them expect that no neither do we but when you frequently say this Dua and acknowledging that hey I'm about to die I don't know when definitely this would reflect on your style of living and how you deal with life and death and Allah knows best Muhammad"
