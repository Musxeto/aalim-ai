  "transcript": "boom arrows again yes sir father I forgot to ask you something is it essential in Ramadan for Tiwari for the Imam to finish the whole Musab Quran in the tilapia news is it necessary okay any more questions because in subcontinent people you know they go to pray for 10 days they said they'll eat reduce and in 10 days Quran is over hello my Travis finish I don't want to pray again maybe I will go or not it's not message I said I told them no no it's not necessary to roof a freeze the Quran you have to pay the Ravi for 30 days it's better nothing good for all that's all I want I will answer his question is clear lots of the messages including the haramein in Mecca and Medina recite one juzu per night and this is something that is recommendable it was recommended by the Prophet Allah so son when he instructed Abdullah nominal ass may Allah peace with him and with his father to finish the Quran once a month and this is done by reciting one juzu per night so taraweeh of Ramadan is like any other month it is highly recommended to pray with one juzu but is it a must the answer is no is it a prerequisite the answer is no is it logical that we finish it in the first twenty seven nights until so-called lailatul Qatar and the other three nights of the favourite 10 nights of ramadan we do not pray at all because we finish the Quran this is illogical and this becomes an innovation this has no basis to it but it is recommended to finish it once every night that is one Jew so that you finish the whole Quran once a month at least people I know people who have finished their third just their third recitation of the Quran since Ramadhan began and some are in their fourth and maybe more so this is a field for trying to gain more and more reward having said that one has to be really careful as we've stated in our first segment when we talked about priorities is it the quality we want all the quantity is it pondering upon the Quran reading it enjoying it feeling its sweetness having it touch your heart directly or is it like the Ferrari Imams have American Idol I mean and what is this we shift from zero to 60 in two point one second it's a new tells Tesla what is this is not the Quran that Allah ordered us to recite so people focus on quantity rather than quality this is wrong if I were given the choice to finish the Quran or to hear one third of the Quran or even a quarter of the Quran throughout the whole month of Ramadan but in a nice slow recitation that I can relate to and comprehend definitely I would take the latter the quantity is not of that gate essential I can do that on my own time and Allah knows best"
