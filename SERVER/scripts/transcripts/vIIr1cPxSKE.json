  "transcript": "forgot about the man from the UK says what is the best way to learn and is it best to follow one single map or to do something else man the issue of learning is a very long process it's hard it consumes time it requires efforts and sincerity above all however the people when they learn they have different ways of learning some of them choose a particular school of thought and follow it while the others say no we do not follow schools of thought blindly we select to choose the Koran to follow the Quran and the Sunna with the understanding of the righteous predecessors of the set up of the three favorite centuries so which one is most authentic well actually those who claim to follow the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors have a problem and this problem is that they do not possess the necessary tools to understand the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors therefore the ideal way of learning folk would be and this is what the vast majority of scholars say it would be that you select a very concise motifs are of a particular school of thought so there are a number of short booklets on the FAQ as a whole of a particular map whether it is Abu Hanifa Malaysia free or Hamid Muhammad depending on the availability of scholars of that particular matter so if you are in Morocco for example it is difficult to study the school of thought of imam ahmed because the vast majority they are following them in a malik school of thought if you are in pakistan usually it is abu hanifa if you are elsewhere like in some parts of Egypt it is mm Shafi and so on so it is best for you to select one trustworthy share or alum or a highly decorated student of knowledge and you study with him this concise booklet of fit according to a particular method so you are actually getting a preliminary idea of the whole jurisprudence system the Sharia are the FIP through one school of thought and the rate of accuracy in that particular school of thought is 85 to 90 percent and this is almost the same in all schools of thought that they are 85 to 90 percent correct 10 to 15% the opinion they have adopted is weak and not the most authentic once you finish this you go to a more advanced book effect on the same topic so now you have a very very good idea about the Sharia about the fit as a whole from two authentic to reliable sources of a school of thought once you finish that now it is time for you to study the fact a third time according to the Quran and the Sunna now you have an idea so when the teacher tells you that the meth HAP says so and so and so but the evidence is they depended upon are all weak and not authentic and the Prophet said that a salatu salam so and so and so and this hadith is reported in Buhari or in Muslim or incidentally magic and it is graded as authentic so now you relate things and you base your learning on the Quran the Sunnah after you had done your due diligence after you had read the whole thing according to a particular school of thought this enriches your knowledge it lays the foundation for a systematic way of thinking and learning how to analyze things from studying fit and it is extremely important that this is done at the hands of a sheikh you cannot be a Rambo on your own until I have the tools I can bring the books I have share Google I have the Internet I can browse and I am a logical person I can find the right thing no this is wrong you have to have a share to refer to to ask to fix the way you think because in the beginning when you learn you tend to make a lot and I mean a lot of mistakes we all had gone through this in the early stages of learning when thoughts used to come to us and wow this doesn't make any sense why is gold Haram for men and not other precious stones that are far more expensive than gold and we started to give justifications and things that I remember once calling one of the elders one of the scholars that was like 35 years ago or so and I told him sure because gold is haram for many can we do chaos analogy and say that diamonds are also haram for men because they are more expensive and the guy blasted at me at the phone and he said who are you to make such an analogy analogy has men and has scholars to obtain the knowledge and to look into the evidences not for any time they can hurry to just come and pass by and read a book or two and become scholars and I since then I learned my lesson always refer to the elders to the scholars it share with them your experience tell them I thought that this issue could go either north or south and these are my reasons what do you say share in the scholar with his scholarly knowledge would tell you that no the first opinion is wrong because it was based on so and so and so and this is wrong the right approach would be so and so and so and then you can expand your knowledge through asking to you and scholars not through being your own Rambo"
