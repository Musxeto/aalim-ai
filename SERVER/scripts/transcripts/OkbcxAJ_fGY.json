  "transcript": "Brother Al Adil from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh, am I sinful for loving Ibrahim Al-Islam more than Prophet ﷺ? Like not loving, but I feel more connected to Ibrahim Al-Islam. Like when I hear his stories, I feel like emotional, but for Muhammad ﷺ I don't feel like that. I ask Allah. Akhi, there is something wrong in you. This is not logical. Because we love Prophet Muhammad ﷺ more than ourselves. The Prophet said in an authentic hadith, Wallahi la yu'min. He will not be a full-fledged believer who does not love me, that is a Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, more than his father, his mother, his wife, his children, and his own self. He will not become a believer. So what would happen if someone loves Prophet Ibrahim more than Prophet Muhammad ﷺ? There is something wrong in his mind. What did Prophet Ibrahim do to you compared to what the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ had done to us? We definitely, without any doubt, love Prophet Ibrahim. We mention him in every salutation when we say, Allahumma salli ala Muhammadin wa ala ala Muhammadin kama sallayta ala Ibrahim wa ala ala Ibrahima innaka hamidun majeed. So we definitely love Prophet Ibrahim. We know his sacrifice. We know that he was an ummah of his own. We know that he was thrown in the living fire and in the inferno and Allah saved him. We know that he was ordered to slaughter his own son who was like 13, 14 years of age and he complied and Allah saved him and sacrificed him and substituted him with a great ram. We know that he opposed his father, his tribe, the whole world and stood alone in front of them and destroyed the idols. We know all of this. But then what? Compared to what our Prophet Muhammad had done ﷺ and it would take me ages just to say the tip of the iceberg of what he had done to us. Definitely you have something wrong. There are fuses, short circuiting up in your head if you love anyone more than the Prophet ﷺ. Yes, we love Prophet Ibrahim, Prophet Nuh, Prophet Musa, Prophet Isa and all the Prophets of Allah and each one has a special place in our hearts but none and all of them combined would not become even close to our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. So would you be sinful? Yes you would, without any doubt. Would I be a Muslim? I'm not sure, you're not hating the Prophet ﷺ but in order for you, imagine, there are three questions for you to be asked on the Day of Judgment in your grave when the two angels come to you. Who is your Lord? What is your religion? And who is this man who was sent to you? If you don't have complete and undoubtful and unconditional love to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ you won't be able to answer these questions. And if you don't, you're going to be hit on your head with a hammer that would turn you into salt. May Allah protect the soul. So think again. Go and buy the book called How He Treated Them, where it describes the shama'il and the characteristics of the Prophet ﷺ. In like three, four months time or maybe less, insha'Allah on Huda TV, on this blessed channel, I will begin, insha'Allah, they will air the series that I'm recording about the Prophet ﷺ of the book compiled by Imam al-Tirmidhi and authenticated by Sheikh al-Albani, al-Shama'il al-Muhammadiyya. It will tell you who Muhammad ﷺ is and I hope this would help you open your eyes and see the sun in the middle of the day and acknowledge your Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to be the most beloved person on earth to your heart. May Allah make us under his flagship on the Day of Judgment. May Allah grant us a sip and a drink of his pool on the Day of Judgment and may Allah make us among those close sitting to him in Paradise. Ameen. Hadha wa Allah a'lam wa nisbatu al-ilmi ilayhi aslam wa sallallahu wa sallam wa barak ala nabiyyina Muhammad wa ala alihi wa sahbihi ajma'in. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah. Al-Fatiha."
