  "transcript": "when someone says anything about his death can the reply be may allah forbid it's a common phrase and it appears to me that this is not part of the permissible way of saying unless he intends it that god may allah forbids this now maybe it's inevitable so that is why when um appease once the prophet came and she said oh allah may allah make me enjoy my father abu sufyan my brother and my husband muhammad sallallahu alaihi she's praying to allah azza that allah prolongs their lives more and more and the prophet told her you have asked allah for how do you translate this there no it's nothing so you ask allah for ages that have been done with allah set the age for this one and for this one for this one so there's no point in saying may allah prolong your your age it's done so you don't ask allah for such things but if the intention is when you die god forbids not now but may allah postpone it as much as possible this inshallah you"
