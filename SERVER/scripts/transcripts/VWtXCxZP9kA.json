  "transcript": "Azad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, is it a must to obey my self-entitled elder sister? She always orders me to do things like making a cup of coffee or other things she can easily do on her own by sitting up from bed, so lazy not to even get up from her bed or the couch all day. She a lot of the times doesn't even pray her salah on time or even misses it out of laziness. I obey her a lot of times to avoid arguments but sometimes just say no politely due to being busy in something for exams and then she starts ranting, expressing like I'm being very mannerless. Jazakallah Khair. Wa Jazakum. First of all, this is not how families are run. The relationship between siblings should be based on respect, on mutual benefits, and if it's based on one-sided, Simon says, this is not normal. I'm not obliged to obey my elder brother or my elder sister because they're not my parents. Yes, my parents say go and prepare a cup of tea. I would do that without any questions asked. My brother says, do this. I say, say please. He does not have the right to order me around and boss me around for his own interest just because he's older than me. It has to be mutual respect. So the sister cooks, cleans, irons, does the home chores for me when she tells me I need you to drop me at this place or to bring this for me from the grocery shop. I would say with all pleasure. I would do that and I would love to do that. But if she's just bossing me around, no, I'm not obliged to obey her at all. Let her do whatever she wants to do."
