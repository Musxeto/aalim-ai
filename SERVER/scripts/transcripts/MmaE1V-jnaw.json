  "transcript": "so just now we discussed that a muslim man married a non-muslim woman and she practices still not practicing uh the muslim way so if after uh preaching to her and after trying to da'wah and teacher islam but it does not stick or the wife does not follow can he divorce his wife first of all divorce is a serious issue and we shouldn't this decision unless it is needed and a necessity however divorce is in the hand of the man and if he sees that his marriage is not fruitful not beneficial not going in the right direction the answer is yes he can divorce so would it be permissible to use as leverage when he says to his right listen i married you and now i'm practicing and if you are not willing to abide by the minimum minimal levels of islam such as wearing the hijab not free mixing not doing sins openly i don't see that i can stay married to you so the choice is yours if she chooses not to practice and she decides to leave this is her choice divorce is always an option but again the problem is not in divorcing her the problem is why did you choose her in the first place i have so many brothers coming to me and say ah i'd like to make a beaver chair why oh i love islam okay there is this sister she is born muslim practicing she uh knows the quran by heart she knows the sunnah yeshua but the revert used to dance ballet okay so she he knows how to play the violin and she also has six ban taekwondo you were looking for a bodyguard or what look for a muslim mother who would be good for your children and to you so many men are only interested in rivers i don't know what they see in the rivers they think that they're more interesting they're hotter than originally muslim women and this is a misconception this is actually stupid and unfortunately nowadays i'm getting so many sisters coming to me and saying cher i would like only to marry revert men excuse me what's wrong with originally muslim men someone who has a clean record this person with clean record it's clean records with allah but he comes with a lot of heavy baggage because as so many issues he may not be able to correct and rectify because it is a revert so this is an issue that muslims have to look into don't play russian roulette with marriages what is russian roulette he's bringing a revolver with six chambers putting only a bullet and then you roll it and then yeah you say bismillah it's empty now it's your turn you roll it and one of you is going to end up dead this is what happens when you take a woman who is not practicing who doesn't know your traditions and customs who doesn't know how to talk to your mother and respect your father who doesn't understand islam this is what's going to happen at the end alhamdulillah we have reached the end of our third session of the conference please keep on sharing any perls of wisdom that you have gained throughout the session on your social media with the hashtag tsp2021 be steadfast we do have some live polling session going on in our telegram group chat so if you are in it please do um participate in our polls our fourth and final session tomorrow uh which is on the 28th of march 2021 will begin at 2 30 pm malaysian time inshallah"
