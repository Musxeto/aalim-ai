  "transcript": "How do we achieve, how do we advise a parent who is heavily involved in doing Khuraj but distant in his relationship with his family? JazakAllah Khairan Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim. Alhamdulillah wa salatu wa salamu ala Rasulullahi wa alihi wa sahbihi wa tadbihi wa ta'ala. As you see, the age has stolen my voice, so I won't be singing anything today. I'll just try to make it as clear as possible. Alhamdulillah. Khuruj, what is meant by Khuruj? It has two meanings. Number one, of course, Khuruj is exit in Arabic. But in Islamic terminology, Khuruj means either to rebel against the Muslim ruler, like the Khawarij. This is the same words stemmed from Khuruj. Or it refers to what is known with the Tabligh-e-Jama'ah, when they go for three days, one week, forty days in their Dawah process. Which one is the questioner asking about? I would presume the second, because the questioner said that the father is neglecting his family. So, first of all, Jama'at-e-Tabligh is a group found in the Muslim world, and they have their roots from the subcontinent with the Deobandi sect. And you know what's related to them. The scholars had spoken about this sect and group. I know personally a great deal of their members. They're the most kindest people on earth. They're the most generous people on earth. They're the most down to earth. But with all this, it doesn't say whether this is good or bad. What says whether this is good or bad is the Qur'an and the Sunnah. And definitely they are involved in many bid'ahs, in many things that are not according to the Qur'an and to the Sunnah, and they have a lot of fabricated processes in their Dawah. So, I always advise people not to associate with them in the Khuruj, not to reject them or to spit in their faces, or, you innovators, we're not going to step on your neck. No. They're very kind. If they come to your home, accept them, give them food, give them drink, and give them Dawah. They are focused on a number of things that are innovations, but they are focused on many other things that are good. They invite people to Salat, they invite people to Sunnah, growing the beard, except for women, of course, and shortening your thawb, going to the masjid, encouraging this social life, which is good. But they have a lot of innovations. They depend on weak hadiths. They depend only on these things. You cannot speak about any other things, no politics, no jihad, no amr ma'ruf, no mumkah, everything that is, it divides the Muslims. We can't speak about this. So, what do we speak about? Miswak, prayer in masjid, and reading Riaz al-Saliheen, or Tabligh al-Nisar, or Hayat al-Sahaba for Al-Kandahlawi. This is their constitution. But they have good things, they have a lot of bad things. So, now, what is the advice to this father? Akhi, Allah has told you in the Qur'an, ya ayyuha allatheena manquo anfusakum wa ahlikum naran. Protect yourself and your family. This is your priority in life. But, unfortunately, it's an escape. If I do khuruj, I don't have to worry about my kids. I don't have to worry about my nagging wife. I hope she's not watching this. I love you. You're on my heart. So, I don't have to worry. I just go for one week or for 40 days. I enjoy life. I enjoy sitting in the masjid, doing qiyam layl, doing storytelling. I was in South Africa, and the car ran out of fuel, and we were in a tribe that eats men. I heard this from one of the tabligh that I was attending. Wallahi, I heard this person, and nobody told me. And the guy is coming from South Africa and saying, and we were stuck in the jungle. Akhi, what are you doing in the jungle? Give me a break here. Don't you think I come from Bollywood? And the guy said, and we were in a tribe that eats men, man-eaters. How do you know? Beware, man-eaters. Lion crossing. Well, what is this? And the guy said, we did not know what to do. We ran out of gas, and it was almost sunset, and we started doing dua. And all of a sudden, the car starts. MashaAllah, Tabarakallah. This solves the fuel crisis. Very good. And we reach our destination. So, who wants to go with us for one week, or for 40 days next trip? Everybody goes, I will go, I will go. If you're paying for the gas, I'm willing to do it. Your dua is accepted. So, it's a way of running away from your domestic problems, your children, your wife, your relatives. But this would not help you in your grave, or on the Day of Judgment. You have to take care of your own children. If you do that, yes, you can do whatever you wish after that. Go to the gym, go for da'wah, go for whatever, but focus on upbringing your children, because the Prophet said, كُلُّكُمْ رَاعٍ وَكُلُّ رَاعٍ مَسْقُولٌ عَبَرِيَّةٍ All of you are shepherds. And every shepherd is going to be questioned about whom Allah made him responsible for. So, this is what you're going to be questioned. Not the ummah. Allah's not going to question me about my ummah. Allah's going to question me about whom I left in my home. How I did with them. Did I leave enough money? Did I give them da'wah? Did I teach them my level best to become good Muslims and try to fix whatever was not appropriate or not? Allah knows best."
