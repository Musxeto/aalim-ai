  "title": "The Prophet ‎ﷺ  is happy when Muslims give for charity assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "So he started encouraging the Muslims on the pulpit to give and shelter themselves from hellfire even by half a date. And he recited the verses that would encourage this. Nobody moved. And everybody was sitting until one man came with a big bag of food and clothes that barely he could carry. And he placed it in front of the Prophet ﷺ as charity. The moment the companions saw this, they immediately ran to their homes and brought all what they can until they made a big pile of food and clothes and things that they would benefit from. Then the face of the Prophet ﷺ lit and he was pleased by their reaction to his call to help those in need. This is how we should react. This is when we should be happy, not for worldly things, not for seeing sins. When we hear of people coming to Islam, even if they were enemies of Islam, we're happy. When we see Muslims benefiting from charity, we're happy. When we see glad tidings for Islam and the Muslims, we become happy like the Prophet ﷺ. We have a short break. Stay tuned. Inshallah we'll be right back. For more information visit www.fema.org. For more information visit www.fema.org."
