  "transcript": "someone asked a question like when allah says in the quran that not to take the muslims as close friends so they have explained that in the explanation they have quoted one of uh that we shouldn't follow um gregorian calendar because this is like imitating the disbelievers and even in one of their uh answers uh within this topic they say that um we shouldn't learn their language except in case of necessity now this confuses me because when they say they say it in the context of imitating the disbelievers but chef as we know that the language doesn't include when it is you have when you say that imitating disbeliever means in their customs and their religions can you please like i'm really confused about that okay i will answer inshallah labee from bangladesh he says i have a problem some people use the ayah that do not take the jews and the christians as allies and he says that we have to stop using the gregorian calendar and we have to stop uh learning their language as this is part of imitating them that and he's confused well there's no need to be confused first of all what is not permissible to imitate them in as the prophet said um the long hadith may allah be pleased with the man with his father he said at the end women and whoever imitates a people he's among them he's from them so scholars clarified that imitating them is to imitate them in the customs and the religion and the traditions and how they look and what they wear so that anyone who sees you would think that you are one of them i have learned their language so if i take off my arab dress and put on my t-shirt and jeans would anybody seeing me or listening to me doubt that i'm a muslim of course not even if i speak english they would definitely acknowledge that i am a muslim by the way i look by the way i dress by the way i behave but when someone follows their customs if someone is with them in a church on a sunday people would say that this is a kafir he's a christian if someone is celebrating the diwali or putting a christmas tree a tree and light it up in his house they would say he's a christian so this is prohibited learning their language due to studying to give da'wah because this is your country and this is your native language your mother tongue there's no problem in that but when we are arabs two of us and we abandon arabic and we start a conversation in english whoa masha'allah intellectual sophisticated ah this is haram you're arabs why are you talking in english it's easier to communicate no it's not easier to communicate you have an inferiority complex you have a problem the problem is here be proud of your religion be proud of who you are so what about using gregorian calendar yes this is something that is a problem because the muslims must i reiterate the muslims must feel honored and proud with their heritage and their tradition so we should not use the gregorian calendar except as an auxiliary something uh inferior and second we always have to speak about the hijri calendar and it's shameful when you go and ask people in the west okay which year are we in in the history years of the i don't know which month i don't who cares it's not ramadan we care only when ramadan comes subhanallah this is something that all muslims should abide by like the disbelievers abide by their heritage by their language by their culture why is it always the muslims and the arabs are treated as second class because they look at themselves as second class and they are if they abandon their religion the third class but if they abide by their religion by the sunnah and they're proud of it then they can be not only first class they can be even flying the airplane"
