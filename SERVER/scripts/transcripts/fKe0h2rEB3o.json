  "transcript": "giving a vow another this is not recommended see when it's a form of exchange or Allah if you cure my child I will slaughter a cow and give it to the four if my son passes the exams I will fast three consecutive days if I get a new job I will perform Hajj this year so this is a vow this is another and pledging something that Allah has not obliged it upon me and this is what the Prophet said erase a lot of serum that you should not make a vow because making a vow is a means where a lot of all-mighty extracts and takes money from a miser from someone who stingy who otherwise would not have offered this therefore one should not take such a vow but if my son is sick or if I'm having problems or calamities or my family are undergoing something that is any bothering them and they go and pay so the car feed people give charity there's nothing wrong in that none whatsoever the Prophet had said that is thought to Salam charity in secret where no one knows about it it extinguishes the wrath of Allah those are the anger of Allah Azza WA JAL this is something that is highly recommended and there's no problem in that insha Allah so I'd advise you I was so fun to go through it and listen to that clip again maybe you misunderstood something or maybe I missed something so that we can ensure Allah talked about it"
