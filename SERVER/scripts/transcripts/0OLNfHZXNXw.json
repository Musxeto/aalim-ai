  "transcript": "[Music] can [Music] alhamd dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new program that deals with theth selected and collected where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam mentioned the heart and how important it is to our lives to our Islam to our Iman and to the whole world now a lot of people don't know this or may know about it but tend to neglect it Overlook it and this is why we find great emphasis on the importance of the heart mentioned overwhelmingly in the Quran and also in the Sunnah of the prophet in the authentic Hadith the prophet saysat Allah the almighty does not look at your images at your bodies and at your wealth rather Allah looks at your hearts and your Deeds your actions now if you contemplate you will understand without any doubt that this morsel this organ is the ruler it is the master of all other organs if it is in a sound and fine State then all the other organs of the body would be in a sound and fine State and the opposite is also correct if the heart is correct corrupt the whole body and the rest of the organs of the body would be corrupt and this might be a little bit confusing how is it corrupt we see that many many disbelievers have excellent physique and they have good bodies good health what we mean by being sound or corrupt it refers to the actions so when the heart is sound you will find that the body and the organs all act in a way that pleases Allah when the the heart is pure and in a good State and in a good condition filled with the love Allah of Allah nothing occupies it rather than what Allah the almighty loves it's filled with the fear of Allah the Hope in Allah the Trust In Allah the fear of falling into what Allah hates and abhor once the heart is in such a condition the whole body the organs of the human being would act and behave in a way that Allah loves so they would stay away from Haram they would hasten to do what Allah has commanded and one would stay away from doubtful and dubious things for the fear of falling into sin but if the heart is corrupt if it is seeking its own whims and desires even if you know that Allah abhor and hates and forbids these things when the heart is so corrupt and filled with such filth may Allah protect us you will find that the whole body is speeding and racing to do what angers Allah falling in sin after sin falling in dubious things and clear Haram Things become because this heart is following its whims and desires that is why it is said the heart is the king and the organs of the body are the disciples the citizens the soldiers the followers the subjects of these of this King they obey him no matter what he orders them to do even if the king orders them to throw themselves in fire they would gladly do so and they would never go against what the king tells them and this is why when the king is righteous is God-fearing is fair and just you will find that his subjects are are an identical copy of him doing all what he instructs them to do but when the king is corrupt when the king is bad then the soldiers the subjects the followers would only be a reflection of their leader and their Master at the sight of Allah asael nothing prevails and nothing would help except if a person has a sound heart listen to these beautiful verses where Allah says the day that is the day of judgment when there will not benefit anyone their wealth or their children it would not benefit you no matter how many children you have how big your bank account is on the day of judgment none of this would benefit you but only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart and what is a sound heart a sound heart is a heart that has no place for other than the pleasure of Allah it's a heart that has no room for sins has no room for shik or kufur has no room for dubious matters or whisperings of Shan it is a sound heart and this is why you find people who are poor might be terminally sick and Ill might be tested and tried with so many calamities you find them content when they H have a sound heart but those who do not fit this description those who might be millionaires billionaires healthy wealthy have everything in this life yet in their hearts you will find other than Allah's pleasure you will find the love of their children or spouse houses the love of their country over the love of Allah and Shar you will find that these things fight in his heart over the love of Allah when Allah's love departs because Allah is the most self-sufficient subhanahu wa'ta'ala he does not accept anyone to be associated with him or anything so the moment we have in our hearts something that we adore and love more than our love to Allah that would turn against us and what would be a form of Torment to us in this life and most of the Muslims are oblivious of this fact they don't know it they love things so much that they're blinded you see anything else unfortunately if you love your own child to the extent that you give preference to him than Allah Allah will torment you with your own child that you love when he's late you're depressed and sad when he's sick you're depressed and sad when he's disobedient and undutiful you're totally demolished and destroyed if you love a spouse if you love your job if you love your wealth if you love your car all of these are a huge crowd in your heart Allah's love would leave you alone and that would be your torment in this duny a sound heart is totally vacant from all of these things and it's filled with the love of of Allah most Muslims are oblivious of the fact that these little little sins that they're committing destroy their hearts but nobody cares about the fitness of the heart we care about how big our biceps are how can we how much can we um squat or deadlift this is what we care about the heart is at the bottom of a priority list yet once you open your eyes and discover that this is what you should be taken care of because this is the king then you will understand this Ayah Allah says about the Jews so for their breaking of the Covenant we cursed them and made their hearts hardened due to their sins due to breaking their Covenant with Allah Allah the almighty cursed them not only that he made their hearts hardened the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam elaborates and he says when the servant of Allah commits a sin there's a black dot on his heart and if he continues and if he actually when this black dot is printed on his heart If he repents if he refrains and asks a love for forgiveness his heart is polished and it becomes pure and clean and shiny but if he continues to do sins like we do then black spot over a black spot it would cover the whole heart and tarnish it totally this is that is mentioned in the Quran this is the tarnishing and the stain that covers the heart Allah says in the Quran no rather the stain has covered their hearts of that which they were earning it's your own Deeds sins that made you who you are now look at yourself in the mirror what do you see your actual body but what is in your heart it's fill with greed With Envy with hatred with in it's filled with grudges and hatred and all of this is not something that you as a Muslim should have we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back the life and health of our bodies are essential what is more important is the life and the health of our hearts and the Heart Is neglected by most Muslims physically and spiritually as for physically we love and adore junk food and we love to eat anything that has sugar in it and wheat and this kills us extra salt and this kills the heart but nobody cares we look at how we look that is what is important spiritually the prophet prohibited us from something that is permissible for the fear of the health of our hearts the prophet said do not overdo it by laughing a lot do not laugh a lot why the prophet says because a lot of laughing kills the heart it makes your heart dead you would not be able to find the sweetness of Salat or the reminders of Allah or to comp contemplate upon the greatness of Allah subhanahu this is all because of too much laughing all the time we pay money for standup comedians who make fun of everything it's crazy now if the prophet prohibited usat from something that is permissible laughter is fine and it's fun within limits if the prophet prohibited us from overdoing it so that the heart would not die what do you think of a person who does not pray F or in the Masid on daily basis what do you think had happened to the heart of a person who consumes RBA mortgage and this is one of the seven major sins in Islam and Allah cursed those who deal with it what happens to those who lie and cheat and bribe and consume Haram and they don't care about Allah's commands subhanahu wa taala who what do you think of someone who finds his Solace and comfort in watching movies listening to music all the time what is happening to his heart his heart is dead shrouded and we should pray janaza prayer on it because there's no hope in it may Allah protect us the most honorable thing in a person's body is his heart the heart is the one who knows Allah the one who strives to Allah the one who loves Allah the heart is the place of Iman gratitude conviction the heart is the one that Allah addresses that Allah sends the messengers to the heart is favored with the best of gifts and blessings of Allah such as conviction and understanding and comprehension the prophet saysat the hearts are between two of Allah's fingers Allah flips them as he wishes and also the prophet saidat in his Dua oh Turners of heart make my heart steadfast on your religion but what is the heart says the heart is a piece of clotted blood that is black and it is in the heart of the body and it is where the soul lives and where the comprehension is and in Arabic it's called because is to flip the and the Heart flips or because it's the essence of the thing the heart is the essence of the individual so it's in the middle of his body and the heart is where the comprehension is Allah says in the Quran so have they not travel through the Earth and have hearts by which to reason and ears by which to hear for indeed it is not eyes that are blinded but blinded are the hearts which are within the chests so the comprehension the reason Allah tells us is in the heart now this is problematic to some people because people have differed where is the origin of comprehension is it in the brain is it in the heart is it in the chest some people say it definitely it's in the brain because if you blow someone hard on his head he'll be unconscious and the comprehension would go and this means that the brain is the CPU and the engine and I T may Allah have mercy on his soul looked into it and said to say that the most authentic opinion is that the soul of an individual ual has a collaboration with the brain and with the heart and comprehension happens in between the two however like I says the comprehension is in the heart this organ that is in our chest it does the comprehension and the brain is the receiver so the intention the determination the verdict and the command all happens in the heart while the brain receives it sees it hears the senses report to the brain and it visualize things and it sends the summary they executive report to the heart the heart being the king and the ruler looks into it either approves it like any CEO would do or rejects it then sends it back to the brain where the brain executes the command that was taken so the collaboration is there but the brain is actually the secretary it is not the one that makes the decision it is not the one that is determined and has the intention to do things and this is what Islam has stated Imam Ahmed and Muhammed where they say that the collaboration is there nobody can deny it but the brain is like a secretary he just delivered what it perceived and the heart is the one that does the comprehension the understanding and takes the decisions for all of that now with this we will conclude inshallah"
