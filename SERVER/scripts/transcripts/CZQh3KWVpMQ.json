  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah if you remember last class we said that the witness of the Prophet Alam returned him to his mom when he was four years of age after encountering the Archangel jiel splitting his chest in an operation taking his heart washing it in Zam Zam water and returning it EXT rating whatever Shan would have utilized from that heart so now his heart is purified and shatan had no way to do anything evil with the prophet Alat wasam and this incident happened twice in the lifetime of the Prophet alham once when he was four years of age and the second time before the miraculous night Journey as we will come and discuss later on insh the prophet stayed with his mom for two years from 4 till 6 and when he was 6 years of age Amina wanted to visit her maternal uncles and aunts who lived in Medina so she took her son and traveled all the way to Medina and stayed there for about a month as we know at the time it was a known fact that whoever went to Medina would encounter a strange illness and a fever that would cause a great deal of hardship to people and sometimes it may be fatal to others which unfortunately was the case with the prophets Mother after her month's stay she feel a a bit sick so she went back with her son to Mecca the distance between Mecca and Medina is about 500 kilm give or take and by train it's about couple of hours and few minutes by car it's almost five to 6 hours by camel it may take a good 3 days trip so it was a hard trip and if one was sick and having fever that is even worse unfort unfortunately her health deteriorated on the way and in Al AB which is an area between Mecca and Medina she died and was buried there so this young child 6 years of age was taken back to his grandfather in Mecca and his grandfather had a strange attachment though he had many many children and grandchildren yet no one caught his attention his empathy his Mercy his love more than Muhammad so this child would do things no one else could dare to do he would sit on his [Music] grandfather's chair and his uncles would try to bring him down but his grandfather would say leave him this son of mine will have a huge and bright future because he could see it in his face and we can see this in our children sometimes that this child is going to be something and this sh is going to be a bum unfortunately this happens but with the prophet it was pretty obvious he loved him a lot and he favored his own grandson more than any of his own Sons This Love that he showered the prophet with unfortunately lasted only for two years just as the prophet was 80 years of age another catastrophe his grandfather dies but before he died he gave Prophet Muhammad Alam to his uncle Abu Talib and he told Abu Talib to take good care of his nephew so Abu Talib took him in and he protected him he sheltered him he cared for him of course the prophet am being brought up in his uncle's house was not rich and neither was his uncle who had many children so at some part of the time or some point of time the prophet had to work and he worked as he told us as a Shepherd for some families and he worked in trade sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam just to to make ends meet when the prophet Alam was a teenager like 13 14 years of age his uncle took him on a trade journey to Syria and this was the norm in Arabia trade came from Yemen to Mecca and from Syria to Mecca and it was a hub because people from all over the world came for pilgrimage to the Kaa so they would at the same time of their religious Journey trade and buy things and sell things in this season that takes place every year so in one of these Caravans Abu Talib took his nephew with him and went to Syria in the books of s this is affirmative and certain that the prophet went to Syria what comes next is debatable where there is no authentic Hadith of the monk bah encountering the prophet Alat wasam and The Story Goes that he he was met by the monk bah who was in his Monastery never ever to come down and meet such Caravans that Caravan he came down which was shocking to them and he started to look at each and every one of them until he stopped at the prophet Alam and he said that this is the leader of the worlds this is the messenger of the world of the of Allah to the worlds and Allah will send him as a mercy to the worlds all of this is not authentic and there's not an authentic Hadith and when they ask him how did you know he said that I have um seen that every tree and every um uh piece of rock or stone were prostrating and greeting him and they don't do this except for prophets how would you know this did you live to see prophets before him and this thing is being done to him so these stories we do not accept and take to be true and we just read them because the books of s included them now he recognized the prophet Sall wasallam by what we know know that the prophet had which is the Seal of the prophethood which was something between the shoulder blades of the Prophet at his back like the egg of a dove or a small apple and this is a sign of prophethood know that the prophet was known to have and it was his description in previous scriptures and B the monk ordered Abu Talib not to go all the way to Syria because if the Jews were to know and hear of him they would kill him so he ordered Abu Talib to send him back to Mecca and so did Abu Talib he sent the prophet wasallam back to Mecca with some of uh um his men the prophet Alam told us that he witnessed an alliance now this Alliance is known as the alliance of the uh um alul uh the various Alliance and this was formed in the month of and the month of the is one of the Sacred months we have four sacred months every single SLE year and this is when the clans of Banu hashimu ald Z they all gathered in the house of Abdullah and they had this Pledge of Allegiance among one another that they would not not find anyone in Mecca who was oppressed except that they would avenge him and anyone who was wronged they would make the wrongdoers pay for what they had done so this was a noble cause and the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam accepted that and he witnessed it Al albani may Allah have mercy on his soul authenticated the Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said I was present in the house of Abdullah when an alliance was formed instead of which I would not like to have red camels which is the most valuable thing in to the Arabs and if I were to be invited to such an alliance in the time of Islam I would respond so the prophet Sall wasallam praised this Alliance though it was formed at the time of kufur and not only that he said if I were to be invited to a similar Alliance in Islam I would accept such an invitation and this also shows us that nowadays International treaties that may happen between countries some of the youngsters some of the youth would say Oh They'll they'll shoot from the they start shoot from the hip as they say and they would oppose it and not only oppose it they would accuse people of kufur and shik for contributing in such an alliance you cannot contribute you cannot participate you cannot join such International agencies this is kufur this is sh no it's not as long as there's nothing against Islam our Prophet told us Sall wasallam if it was to serve Justice and Humanity without having anything to do to go against Islam that would be uh allowed without any problem and Allah Knows Best finally we have to notice that as the prophet Salli wasallam up upbringing was in Mecca the norm upon the youth in Mecca was to party all night long and to be wasted drinking wine at night and to worship idols listen to music and concert s Allah protected the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam from all of that so the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam did not ever engage in such uh issues he hated whenever someone swore by their Idols he would never touch any of the idols seeking blessings like everyone else he would never eat anything that was slaughtered for these Idols or anything that had other than the name of Allah mentioned to it and he tried one night or two nights to go to a concert and listen to music and he failed because Allah Asel made him fall asleep so he knew that this is from Allah and he never attempted it again and one narration while he was rebuilding the Kaa with the people of qur when part of it was demolished due to a flood water he was helping his uncle Abbas and others to carry big chunks of of rocks so his uncle said to him why don't you take your waist wrapper and put it on your shoulder to protect your shoulder from these heavy rocks but this meant that his would be exposed when he attempted to do this he fainted immediately and fell to the ground looking to the heavens saying to the people around him where is my waist wrapper where is my waist wrapper and it was put back on him again and never ever he was seen after thatat exposing his that was the norm at the time that people would expose their AAS in public especially if they had a legitimate reason such as protecting their bodies with their clothes but the prophet Sall wasallam was protected by Allah there are so many incidents for Allah's protection of his Prophet sallallah alhi wasallam to be the most pure the most honest the most truthful among all men that this is something that no one could have denied and no one does deny till date as he is the best man ever to had walked the Earth Sall alai wasam with this we come to the conclusion of our third episode or third class until we meet you in the following class I Leave You [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
