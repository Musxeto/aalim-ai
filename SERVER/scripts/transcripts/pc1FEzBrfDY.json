  "title": "Should he check his underwear & private part after he urinates? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sayyid from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh in your video you said if someone have whispers that he meets Mehdi he should only check when he go for call of nature. I want to know when he go for call of nature is it mandatory to take his underwear and his private part and should he take his private part until he urinate? Sayyid this doesn't make any sense. When you go and answer the call of nature you're not going to act like Stevie Wonder and look upstairs. You're going to look at your private stuff. You're definitely going to check yourself but you should not exceed and transgress by trying to open your private part or investigate more than what you're supposed to do. This is a natural thing especially when Shaytan obsesses you. If you keep on going every half an hour to check you're doomed. So the point is when you get the feeling that something came out and you go and check and nothing is there and you keep on getting this feeling this is what we say stop. As long as you did not have these intrusive thoughts that are related to sexual fantasy that were prolonged enough to emit madhi don't check. When you go to answer the call of nature up to three four hours while doing your thing by default everybody looks and if there's nothing alhamdulillah move on with your life and Allah knows best."
