  "title": "Lent someone money, should I consider inflation when they pay me back as currency value goes down?",
  "transcript": "you have seen from ethiopia uh the question is uh if i have taken some money from someone and the money inflated so am i supposed to take the money like considering the information or just you borrowed some money from someone you know i gave money to someone okay i want to take it back from him am i supposed to consider the inflation or just take the money i did it from ethiopia says if i lent someone money and now i want to get it back you know that usually with third world countries due to inflation the value would go down so what to do well you have to get exactly what you had lent so if you are in um let's say which country uh syria so the syrian era 10 years ago is way way different than the price of the syrian era today well if you had lent someone a million lara then all what you can receive today is a million lira with the prices of today so if a million leira 10 years ago was a thousand dollars now it's probably fifty dollars no problem all what you can receive is fifty dollars and we don't look at inflation the currency that you've received whether it went up or went down it's the same thing so if you had given them a thousand dollars 10 years ago which was a million later and now it is 50 million letters you can get the 50 million layers because this is the equivalent of a thousand dollars you cannot take more or less and i hope this answers your question you"
