  "transcript": "um sir i am 18 years old i i'm suffering from ocd for for several years and for us and for some months i am i constantly i sometimes get the fear of death i fear that what is going to happen when i die or uh what happens uh what happens at the time of death i if i fear death so how can i get rid of how can i think positively of this of death or how how can i think possibly of the of the thought okay i will answer inshallah muhammad from india he says he has a ocd he's 18 years of age and he fears death the fear of death is a natural thing we all fear death no one would say that no i am not afraid of death everybody is afraid of death but here is the trick your fear of death can be positive and can be negative if your fear of death is positive it means that it will drive you to excel in getting closer to allah in preparing for the day of judgment in filling your grave with light with good deeds that will accompany you until resurrection day so this fear of death makes you refrain from doing sins this fear of death pushes you to pray fajr on time in the masjid and to fast mondays and thursdays and to memorize the quran and to do good deeds this fear is positive and it is liked by allah azzawajal because it draws you closer to allah the negative fear is the crippling one is the fear that makes you despair of everything why don't you pray what's the use i'm gonna die and if i die if i'm gonna die then allah will put me in hell so why would i do any good deeds why would i refrain from haram and it becomes an obsession and here is where con satan takes over you controls you and deviates you from doing what allah loves by despairing from allah's mercy by continuously feeding death the fear that cripples you from doing good things you're doomed sorry to say this but there's no way to beat around the bush you are dude doomed you're totally uh gone and on the losing end so what to do sheikh well you have to put high gear you have to trust allah you have to make dua and you have to transfer your negative fear into positive fear by feeling optimistic by doing whatever you can so that once death comes you raise your hands and say i did my best there's nothing you can do i did my best and i'm willing to face allah azzawajal with my best but when your fear is crippling when death comes it's going to be a disaster may allah save us all"
