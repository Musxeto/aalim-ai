  "transcript": "uh so i wanted to know that um like uh in in our culture like uh as kids they usually give the like the newborn kids like gold and stuff so like at that age obviously we won't be having full control over the wealth so um and our parents like also like maybe they can like sell it and all so up like when we grow up if we find out that that goal like might be like over the nisab are we supposed to pay zakat for it it is the responsibility of the guardian if a child's wealth reaches the nisab to give zakat over it now if the guardian did not do that for one reason or the other once a child grows up they must give the zakat for the past times over that wealth however if the gold that was kept was not zakatable in the opinion of the guardian so the guardian thinks that because the gold was worn was used sometimes by the by the girls or by the their mother and there is no zakat in that as it is the madhab or the four schools of thought over the gold that is being worn and used if this is their conviction then there is no zakat in it but if it's an amount of cash money and the parents did not give zakat on that and that child reached the age of puberty took possession of that wealth and got to know that they did not pay the cat for it then it is his responsibility or her to give zakat on the previous years simply because the money is accountable and zakat is allah's right over this wealth so it cannot be let go of it you"
