  "transcript": "abu hafs from bangladesh sheikh my question is regarding libas ashokha i'd be grateful if you'd give us a detailed explanation of it i'd like to add a few things to help you understand why i'm asking this uh in bangladesh although silvarkamis is a customary clothing the customer has now shifted to wearing more western clothes on a daily basis in the urban areas the majority of the people wear shirts pants and other western clothes now i'm 19 especially when i go out for asura wearing silver comes at that time my peers and classmates walk around or play sports wearing western clothes and i feel as if they look at me in a weird way and if i wear a kufi with it and go to the soup for example there there are people who call me hence i fear if i'm unnecessarily standing out and wearing something that actually falls into libasa these are the reasons i'm asking for an explanation of okay from bangladesh he is feeling inferior now in most countries due to the impact of the media due to the impact of movies tv series netflix social media they are tempted to mimic and imitate the western style of life and we see this in the youth you go to the middle east to the lands of islam you go to egypt you go to jordan you go to lebanon you find the same pattern you go to pakistan you go to bangladesh you go to india it's the same pattern of brainwash the people think that by communicating in english speaking english instead of their native language let alone arabic that they're sophisticated that they are educated intellectual people and we see this in our children when they're young and they talk to one another in english oh my god omg lol and they think that being part of this stream that they are sophisticated unfortunately so brother abu hafs is complaining that when we in bangladesh where the sherwal kamis which is the normal customary dress of men in bangladesh due to the impact of westerns of uh culture over the youth most of them now are wearing jeans and t-shirts maybe suits so if i walk in the streets people look at me as if i am from the stone ages this is primitive why is he wearing this so imagine if i were to go to an interview job interview wearing this what would the interviewer say to me what is this why aren't you wearing a suit at least a tie so you get the feeling that even the society is turning against you so he says i'd like to know what is the definition of liberty or the garment of fame as it's roughly translated and it refers to something that makes you stand out in a crowd not the cases you're talking about them wearing t-shirts or shirts and trousers is not libaso you wearing the garments and the dress of your people is not libaso but if you wear for example a garment or a set of clothes that is not related to your country or to the muslims or something that is weird if you wear for example a garment that is totally red or if you wear something like the uh the buddhist wear these yellow or orange garments and you walk around wearing them this would be libascus because people would always point at you and your intention of wearing it is to show off so if i wear my normal traditional clothes clothes in malaysia for example they they're not accustomed to it but this is my identity nobody would say oh this is because the i am from where i am however if a brit where's this in london that would be basic because the guy is not originally an arab he's wearing the costumes of the arabs in a kafir country for what showing the deen this has nothing to to do with showing the deen on the contrary you might be repelling them from the deen when they see you dressed like that so your case is not with libassa alibaster is something that you do or wear in order to stand in a crowd where people would say yeah yeah this guy with the texan hat or with the sambarro or with the the weird trousers or with the skirt he's wearing a kilt for example like the scotch people and and and he's walking in the middle of the road no this is not permissible and it's haram and you will be punished for that in the day of judgment"
