  "transcript": "AmatuAllah from Bangladesh so my question \nis is it permissible for a woman to study in   a college which is co-educational but girls \ndo classes in morning shift and boys at day   shift there is a possibility that I may have \nto sit with a guy in exam though I'm not sure so if you attend a shift where it is segregated   in the in the morning for example for ladies and \nin the afternoon it's only segregated for boys   there's no nothing wrong in that this is \nnot a mixed environment having to be in   an examination Hall with other boys this is \na one shot in a million and it's like going   through the public transportations whether it's an \nairplane or a bus or a train there are other men   we don't say that no it's Haram for you to ride \nin the train this is not free mixing this is   something that we have to encounter whether \nwe are in a restaurant or in a public place   if you're abiding by your hijab and you're not \nfree mixing there's no problem in that insha Allah"
