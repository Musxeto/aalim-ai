  "transcript": "myself from Canada I know mixed scoutings are common stuff and alhamdulillah I don't attend them at all but my dad and my uncle they're telling me like like you know like every deed is just my intentions and like even if you were to go to like a nightclub and your heart is clean like you won't be held accountable for that I know this is not true but how do I like explain it to them about this stuff well this requires a small lecture or a talk if you look at the verses of the Quran you will always find those who believed and did Good Deeds so what they're referring to is belief this is what is dealing with intention but doing good deeds does not fall in this category which means that you've come short the last Ayah in Surat al-kaf you can go and check it out Allah says so whoever is Keen on meeting Allah the almighty meaning in on the day of judgment and hence as a consequence go to Jannah he must do righteous Deeds and not associate others with Allah so again good deeds and intention and Allah stated in Surah in the second Ayah Allah it is he who had created death and life to test you who among you is the best in his deeds a lot of the self such as and others stated that in order for a person's Deeds to be accepted there must be two conditions fulfilled one it should be sincere for the sake of Allah two it should comply with the Sunnah so for example if I come to the Masjid and you tell your father and Uncle this if I go to the toilet and inside the toilet while answering the call of nature I started reciting the Quran or better more for their type I started reading the durood Sharif the salutation upon the prophet Sam in a loud voice is this permissible what are you doing this disrespecting the Quran I said my heart is clean my heart is as pure as gold and all what I want is to get closer to Allah they would say no no no no no this is a bad deed he said touche so it is not enough to have good intention the prophet said it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to sit on a table where people are drinking wine I'm not drinking I'm not even touching it I'm not buying it I'm not even passing it but I'm just sitting with them it's a business lunch or business dinner and we have to sit with these disbelievers or sinful Muslims because it's a business it's totally Haram even if your intention is good because the Deeds are not complying and this is what mother Aisha narrated may Allah be pleased with her the prophet said whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it it is rejected and what your father and uncle are calling you to do is not part of the religion and hence it is rejected foreign"
