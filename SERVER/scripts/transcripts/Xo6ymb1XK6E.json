  "transcript": "the second question is uh I think it's from maram I have been avoiding praying in rows with columns in them I don't think it's from maram but let's assume it's from uh Muhammad uh so he was uh avoiding to pray in rows between columns or uh um pillars in the Masjid some of the brothers wanted to know if we are supposed to skip the entire row or only the part between the pillars also if people are already praying in the row should I join them or start a new row and if the Imam tells me to stop should I listen to him or continue what I'm doing there is no there is no Hadith that the prophet says don't do that all what there is are narrations from the companions such as anas Malik PR and others stating that we used to avoid praying between the RO the pillars in a role and in another narration we as children used to be beaten up if we were to pray in rows that were broken by pillars but there is isn't nothing attributed to the prophet Alat wasam nevertheless when the companions say and narrate that we used to do this at the time of the Prophet this has the ruling of the Prophet ordering them or at least seeing it and approving it so the ruling according to the majority of Scholars is that one must not pray between the pillars or when there are pillars dividing the RW and they should skip the entire row so that the whole row is complete unfortunately some masjids have many many pillars that divide the rows sometimes it means that we've skip like 50% of the rows which means that 50% of the space in the Masjid would be vacant due to these pillars and nevertheless we should do that unless the Masjid becomes packed and there are there is no space as for example in the case when we go to the Haram whether in Mecca or medina and we find these pillars dividing the rows in this in this case you are excused and you may pray or in the case that I come to to a Masjid and I find half of the row already started between pillars I should join them and not skip the row and pray on my own because that would be dividing the umah for no apparent reason and this if there is a sin it's upon those who started the row in the first place"
