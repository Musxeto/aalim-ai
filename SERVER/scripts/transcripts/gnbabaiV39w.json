  "title": "Is there a Hadith that recommends that women should pray in the darkest place of her house?",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing so i say recently i read a hadith which is narrated by tabarrani and it says the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the beloved prayer of a woman inside of allah is the one she performs in the darkest place in her house i would like to know whether this hadith is authentic and is it better for us to pray in dark places we've talked about the ruling on praying in darkness and we said that this is not a sunnah and it depends on the environment because the prophet isam has prayed in darkness total darkness and that was done so that he would not bother his wives while they were asleep but if there is a chance of endangering oneself due to insects or harmful things that may crawl in front of him without him seeing this then definitely turning on the lights would be a plus now is there a hadith recommending that a woman prays in a dark place the answer is no there is a hadith where the prophet allah was comparing things and highlighting to one of his female companions who was so eager to join him in prayer in the masjid of medina and we know that the masjid of medina is a sacred place a prayer in it is equivalent to a thousand prayers elsewhere other than the masjid of mecca al-haram so anyone with little math would say that okay praying in medina is a thousand times better i should try my level best to pray so this woman wanted to join the prophet sallah islam in prayers so he said to her i know that you love to pray in my masjid. let it be known that your prayer in your house is better than praying in my masjid so this is a clear indication that a woman should offer her prayers in her house then the prophet went on to go tighter and tighter to show how much it's best for a woman to conceal her prayers from the outsiders so he went from her house to the inner house to the inner chamber of her own bedrooms so the more it's concealed the better it is at the sight of allah it has nothing to do with darkness it has to do with staying away from men who are non-maharam watching her and of course this if it's in the middle of her house it does the job but the prophet is giving us an example of how best it is for a woman to be concealed from places where men could see her and allah knows best you"
