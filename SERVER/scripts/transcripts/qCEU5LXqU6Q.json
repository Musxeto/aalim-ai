  "title": "They interacted before marriage, now if they get married, will there be no barakah in their marriage",
  "transcript": "Zaeem from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam to Allah So Sheikh my question is if two individuals a boy and a girl graduated from a university that had free mixing or co-education and they used to interact with each other and later when during the time of marriage if the guy sends her proposal and if they get married so as they have sinned before by interacting with each other will there be no barakah in their marriage so should they step back? No there is nothing as such this sin of theirs is a sin by itself just because they had sinned by flirting or socializing or communicating with one another though it's not permissible as they're non-mahram they have not fallen into the major zina and hence in order to rectify the sin they have to ask Allah for forgiveness repent and get it legal by getting married it is not at all advisable to back off when they have feelings for one another and they are fit for one another and they know that they can make it work Islamically by getting married so I hope this answers your question"
