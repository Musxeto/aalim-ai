  "transcript": "[Music] finally karima kandeel says is it permissible for my brother of breastfeeding to shake hands with me you remember that we said there are conditions for breastfeeding so if the child breast was breastfed by a woman before he completed two years of age and he was breastfed five separate meals in this case he becomes a son to that woman and all of her daughters before him and after him become his sisters so kerima if this boy is your mother's son through suckling with the conditions i've mentioned he is your mahram and he can shake hands with you he can be alone with you he can treat you as his own brother and allah azzawajal knows best"
