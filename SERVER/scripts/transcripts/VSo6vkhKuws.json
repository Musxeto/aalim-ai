  "transcript": "Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka Assalamu Alaikum, Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? I am well with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal My question is Sheikh, so if a person actually was in ignorance and then Allah guided him and he Became steadfast and did a lot of righteous deeds like meaning what's between him and Allah, hopefully Allah accepts and Then the person eventually like he feels that he will never ever go back to falling into sins And he's very steadfast, but after some time he fell into some sin And he's been persistent upon it and now he feels that it's like hypocrisy because on the outside he's doing He's doing well and people think he's doing good deeds, but sometimes you know secret sins He falls into it and he thinks he's hypocrite. So how to overcome this Sheikh? JazakAllah The Prophet said alayhis salatu wassalam In an authentic hadith Every single son of Adam is a sinner and The best of sinners are those who frequently repent So it is inevitable that you and I will fall into sin Not that we're encouraged by this hadith to okay. It's been like couple of weeks. I haven't sinned Let me watch some pornography out of it. What are you doing? So well, the Prophet said every son of Adam is sinner. No He is stating a fact not encouraging you but while stating such a fact he is directing us to the way out and the way out is to frequently repent whenever you fall weak and sin always remember that Allah is all-hearing all-seeing and that he as Part of his beautiful names at the web the one who guides people to repent and accept their repentance Ar-Raheem the most forgiving the most merciful al-ghaffar and so on When you acknowledge this and you go back to him Allah accepts you so you try your level best not to fall into sin and Try your level best to seek Allah's forgiveness and to feel deep remorse if you happen to fall again into sin Do the same process again while evaluating. Why did I fall into this sin again? Are there means that facilitate it then? I have to block them. I have to stay away from Whatever encourages me to Fall into the sin over and over again and through this process We hope that we will meet Allah Azza wa Jal and die on Islam while being in a state of repentance And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best You"
