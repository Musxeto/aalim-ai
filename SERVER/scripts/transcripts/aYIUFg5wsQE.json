  "title": "Q: At what age does it become obligatory for one to Fast? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] at what age does it become obligatory to fast now to read phrase the question so that it will become a bit more informative who are those that fasting is obligatory upon them or in another word what are the conditions that must be fulfilled so fasting would become mandatory there are five conditions one is Islam two is to be accountable three is to be able four is to be a resident five is to not have any obstacles and I'll explain this to you in a very easy fashion insha'Allah first you have to be a Muslim which means if a non-muslim comes to you and says your religion is beautiful can i fast with you Ramadan sure thing fast so he fast exactly like I do from the break of dawn till the sunset and he eats futur he eats some bucyk with me in some shorba maybe some briyani this is not accepted from him because he's a kafir he's a disbeliever so condition number one you have to be Muslim in order for you that your fasting is accepted and it's obligated number two to be accountable in Arabic we call it a tech leaf and the cliff means that you have to be sane and adult what do you mean by saying which means that anyone who's insane someone who does not have control of his actions or thought someone who's lost his sanity is not obliged to fast someone who's forty years of age but he takes his poo and wash his face with it he doesn't know when it's morning on when it's evening he doesn't know his father from his brother he doesn't know anything he's a he has the intellect over 3 or 2 years of age child insane he's not obliged to fast and if he does it's not counted for him and likewise a child who did not reach the age of puberty and the evidence when you bring this from share was crystal clear the Prophet said eraser the pen did which means the accountability pen that registers your good deeds and bad deeds the pen is uplifted from free someone who's asleep until he wakes up someone who's insane until he regains his sanity and the child until he reaches the age of puberty so this answers your question though it does not finish my argument at what age does it become obligatory to fast when the child becomes an adult he is obliged to fast it's mandatory upon him to fast oh sure does this mean that a child does not fast because a boy may reach the age of puberty when he is like 13 or 14 years of age so we he doesn't fast say no no no he's obliged to fast when he reaches the age of puberty it doesn't mean that we do not teach him how to fast and train him how to fast earlier on can you explain yeah sure the Prophet says us is awesome order your children to pray when they are 7 and beat them when they are 10 they have not reached the age of puberty they're not accountable yes but this is part of the training from 3 from 7 to 10 3 years I do not lay a hand on the child come son let's pray come pray I'll give his chocolate come with me to the message all people are asking about you encouragement a little bit of intimidation but no punishment at all for 3 years 360 days multiplied by 5 times you do the math I flunked calculus 101 so this doesn't mean he's accountable but this is a training likewise the children the Companions used to ask and have their children fast until it's midday when they're starving and thirsty they would give them probably dolls of wool to play with when it's a sir time and they're totally wasted so they allow them to eat maybe drink next year the period would be longer third year they're okay is it obligatory to defer them too fast no it's not you should train them but what is the appropriate age to train them it differs because such a training depends entirely on their endurance and their tolerance I have one of my grandchildren who's 8 years of age when she started too fast she was 8 and she fasted the whole of Ramallah mashallah no problem not that single day missed not feeling fatigued not crying and and and whining and I have another grandson who's like 11 years of age and he often breaks his fasting he's he can't tolerate it so it did it depends on the tolerance of the person Oh what we do is encourage them give them good words of praising etc until it gets into the system and then Hashanah it would be normal going back to my argument I have not finished so Muslim accountable and then he has to be able for fastened to be mandated what do you mean able ship if he is too old he's 90 years of age he doesn't have any illnesses but being this old he's so fragile and weak so by 12 noon he's almost dead no power so he's not able he's exempted or chronically ill someone who has an illness that mandates that he breaks his fast doctors say he would never ever be able to fast or make up his missed days those are not obliged to fast number four he has to be a resident so a person who's traveling is exempted from fasting and number five obstacles must be removed there should not be obstacles what do we mean obstacles women who are menstruating or having post natal bleeding this out of their choice prevents them from fasting so these are the five conditions memorize them it would give you a lot of knowledge and momentum to understand when too fast and we're not too fast [Music] [Applause]"
