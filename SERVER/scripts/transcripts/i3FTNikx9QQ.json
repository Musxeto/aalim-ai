  "transcript": "before we begin answering and taking your questions as usual there's a few minutes as an introduction to today's episode and the title is don't be a Rambo most of us have delusions think strongly of ourselves and this is OK in most cases until it jeopardizes other people's safety and their livelihood a sister called me few moments ago from now telling me about a relative of hers who died in Carla India due to covered 19 his wife is also infected and in quarantine in hospital their sons are also in quarantine the whole building is being checked to see whether they're infected or not people are taking this matter lightly either because of the conspiracy theories that are surrounding us so they think that okay someone said it's a conspiracy theory so that the economy would fall down and the rich would start to buy cheap or because the shares in China would drop for investment would leave and the Chinese would control it do you have any proof for that no but I heard someone say something heard it from a friend subhanAllah you base your livelihood your safety and the safety of those you love on hearsay don't be a Rambo don't think that my immune system is strong I'll wear the virus down it will go it will come a day or two or go also in a beautiful country of Nigeria a brother called me a couple of days ago telling me Sheikh there is a big problem in Nigeria that people are unable to understand how she is it is though there is a lockdown by the authorities by the Muslim president President Buhari yet people insist some people insisted on performing June hua prayer and he sent me a clip of thousands of Muslims and worshipers facing one another in a very crowded area and thinking that nothing had happened to us either this or we are so poor dying is ok ok don't be a Rambo dying is ok for you I have no problem you can go and die but why in fact your mother your grandmother the children in the family the innocent who come and hug you and kiss you thinking that you are their loved one who cares for them and for their safety if you don't care about yourself give some attention to the community to the society to the other Muslims would you like to be infected if someone comes to you say listen I have it and I'm gonna infect you with it are you ok with that definitely not then how is it ok for you to go and harm others when the Prophet said Allah so Allah Oh min o hadouken he will not believe one of you will not believe until he loves for his brother but he loves for himself if you love for yourself not to be infected by others then at least have the honor not to infect others the authorities told you pray at home in Saudi Arabia the major grand Muftis and scholars of Saudi Arabia gave this instruction two weeks ago yesterday it was my second week praying Friday at my home praying it over for a cos with my family not Juma we've been almost 13 days unable to pray the message unable to sit until it's rock and sunrise and pray unable to do the things we love don't you think that this breaks our hearts definitely it does but Islam is not based on whims and desires Islam is a logical religion it's not based on impulsive decisions it's based on consequences of your choices and what the people are doing in Nigeria what the people are doing in Pakistan and India and trying to be a Rambo is wrong is sinful and is selfish because they care only about themselves they don't care about China or not they don't care about heaven and hell they just want to prove a point so don't be a Fame seeker don't be a Rambo if you don't care about yourself the least you could do is care for your parents your grandparents the elders look at the foreign countries UK u.s. look what's happening in Italy and Spain well Italy is not that dangerous anymore the u.s. is now number one in the spread of the disease the UK even the top in the government the top ranks are infected and are in quarantine after being stubborn and saying and claiming that it's okay 60% of the population gets the virus but then get immuned later on it's okay if we lose a couple of hundred couple of thousands of the elders who needs them don't be a Rambo and look at them now so the problem is not in getting this virus because it can go it and it can come the problem is that all countries of the world are not medically equipped they do not have enough ventilators so each Hospital has 20 to 30 ventilators because they are expecting to get five to ten sick people a day but when a pandemic like this takes place and they end up with a thousand sick people a day they have to be selective they have to play stock for Allah the role of the one who decides who lives and who dies so they have only 30 ventilators and 1,000 are on the waiting list they select the young and the healthy who have more probability of living and the rest may die we can't do anything else so this is the biggest fear not of the infection 80% recover but the average age of those who die is between 70 and 80 years of age the elders are affect affected greatly by this and some children as well and some youth as well but very small percentages do not be a Rambo and pray at home and in sha Allah make a lot of Dura that Allah so JAL unveils this calamity from all of us"
