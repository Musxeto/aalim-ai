  "title": "Can I clean the toilet with my right hand? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "[Music] i like to know if it's permissible to clean the toilet with my right hand scholars in general say that the right hand is honored for good things and the left is reserved for filthy or indecent things where did they get this concept or notion from the fact that the prophet prohibited us from eating or drinking with our left while he ordered us to clean ourselves and to hold our private parts while answering the call of nature with our left and not to use the right so from these evidences the scholars came up with this logical analogy that what's the reason then most likely is this and that so those who follow this type of thinking would tell you when you clean the toilet seat or the toilet in general you use your left hand because it is used for such filthy or indecent or inappropriate things but no one to my knowledge said that this is prohibited to use your right hand so it is up to you there's no problem in using the right hand using the left is safer and better because it is something that you don't eat with so most likely you will not be affected negatively from such an act and allah knows best"
