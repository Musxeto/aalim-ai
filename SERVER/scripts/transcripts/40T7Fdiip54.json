  "title": "When Islam contradicts Science? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "firstly islam is a divine religion it is from allah azzawajal and generally speaking it does not go against science but throughout the years we've discovered that science is not always right and so many theories that come up only to be proven after a few decades that they're totally bogus or wrong and the theory of evolution is one of the closest and simplest ideas of its how bogus people are and how atheists mess up with people's minds claiming to be scientific when it's baseless and ridiculous even but this is not the time to address such an issue"
