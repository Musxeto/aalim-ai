  "transcript": "sumaya says grooms wearing lots of flowers during mica during marriage like coat or they fully cover them with flowers even though it's a culture of a particular place is it allowed first of all we have to know that there are many customs that are not mentioned in Islam and this does not go against Islam so our culture our customs as long as it is not a form of worshipping Allah which means it's an Abba de and innovation if it does not go against the instruction of Allah or the Sunnah of the Prophet Isis I'm it is permissible but when we look at what Samia has explained worrying these Garland's wearing these flowers and this is usually done in India and Pakistan and the likes in the subcontinent if this is an Islamic tradition that even the Imams of the Masjid the scholars of Islam the judges they do it and they do not consider it to be something wrong and this is okay but if it is a practice of the Hindus and this is done by the Hindus and picked up by the Muslims so even they insist on the woman the wife to wear a necklace of black beads for example or an anklet or a ring in her toe and stating that she must not take them off until she dies because this is related to her marriage audhu billah this is totally prohibited and this is imitating the disbelievers and in the hadith of abdullah bin omar may allah be pleased with him and with his father the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said and whoever imitates a people he will be among them so over and over again I keep on repeating this because of the importance for Muslims to believe and to implement this we have our own identity we must not let go of our identity as Muslims an identity does not mean that wearing this red thing I'm wearing on my head this is not part of my identity it's part of my culture so I can come tomorrow wearing a t-shirt or a polo shirt and a G and a pair of jeans there's no problem in that yet my identity is preserved I wouldn't wear something that is only specifically limited to the disbelievers something that is worn by all Muslims no problem in doing it but when it comes to identity we have to preserve it and Allah knows best"
