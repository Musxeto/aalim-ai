  "title": "Can 2 brothers take part in a sheep? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so if you say that we can take part of a camel or a cow can we take part in one sheep meaning that we're two brothers he pays half and i pay half and we slaughter one sheep the answer is no one sheep can only be offered by a single person for himself and on behalf of those dependent on him but you can share if you want in a camel or in a cow so let us ask another question what is best to offer a sacrifice well this depends is it shared or is only for you can you answer both i will answer both if it is shared then definitely a ram is the best because this is solely by you you will not share it with anyone else but if you are slaughtering on your own and not sharing with anyone then a a a camel is the best then a cow then a ram then a goat why would you say this because the prophet al-islam offered his with iran but if he were to offer something without sharing and he did that he would do that with a camel because a camel is higher in all other types so the prophet says for example regarding russell of jumoa whoever performs russell juma and then goes early on the first hour of friday as if he sacrificed a camel if he went in the second hour as if he sacrificed a cow if he went into third hour as if he sacrificed a horned ram which means that the best of sacrifice and the highest grade of them is a camel but this is when you slaughter and offer the sacrifice only for yourself without sharing it with anyone else if i had the options of either sharing a cow or a camel or separately slaughtering and sacrificing a sheep definitely a sheep is better but if i had the options of either slaughtering a cow or a camel only for myself or a ram no sacrificing a cow or a camel is better because it's greater you"
