  "transcript": "assistor says my son has a disorder which affects his mental ability to carry out tasks coherently it is of an autistic nature is he obliged to pray and complete the pillars of Islam and me as his mother should I do more to help him get a better understanding of Islam am I going to be sinful if I don't do this he is 14 but has the mental age of five years old autism was not found or at least was not identified at the time of the Prophet ala system as it is today it is stated that 1% of the children born are autistic and there are levels of autism there is a deficient deficiency of 25% a 50% 75% and psychiatrists and people that deal with such illnesses say that it ranges from inability to communicate with others to look them straight in the eyes to understand basic things to a full range of disability that when there's a person insane so how do we judge such people well in Islam the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam told us that accountability pen it has been uplifted from a person who's insane until he regains his sanity so we have to now look at such a child or a boy who is autistic now 14 years of age could have easily reached the age of puberty so let's assume that he is an adult physically if the person is 5 years brain wise in this case he's a child he doesn't know what's good and what's bad for him he's unable to take a good decision he can't tell whether the person is their relative or evil in this case he's not accountable you're not supposed to teach him how to pray or how to fast and you're not obliged to force him to fast he's not accountable if the person has the ability to know what prayer is and how important it is and he can make certain decisions for himself where he is not any more classified as insane or does not have intellect no he is but in a way he can't write he can't communicate with teachers or strangers but he understands he knows that fire is hot he knows that when you hungry you eat and how to prepare he has this sanity in him in this case he's accountable he must be taught how to fast an order to fast and he must also be taught how to pray and he is to be ordered to pray as well with the Muslims so I hope this answers your question maybe you would ask what about if he is sometimes like this and sometimes like that this the scholars gave an example of partial insanity a person who all of a sudden just clicks and becomes insane for half a day or a day and then the following day he's fine he's communicating he's talking to you with logic so when is insane he's not accountable once he's awake then he must pray and fast and Omaha's best"
