  "transcript": "mm-hmm haseeb from the U.S haseeb or hasib from U.S Allah I have a question so um you know uh so the Ramadan is around the corners and my mom said um basically she's sick right now and she said that she's not gonna um you know fast and she's asking me to um you know because of her health she's asking me to pay zakat and I have a question do I have do I have to pay his account or I can give her money and she she can pay because she doesn't have money or how like how what's the ruling on that one why is she not going too fast Ramadan is her illness chronic or it's just this year or a couple of years and then she'll become better um it's it's like right now uh because I think she she's like she had a surgery and there's like some something like after the surgery she has like a take medicine and stuff like that so she said that you know she cannot make the Ramadan yeah but she can make it in like three four years from now uh yes okay then in this case it is not permissible for you or her to feed a poor person for skipping fasting of Ramadan the feeding of a poor person is only allowed when someone who is chronically ill and the doctors say that this individual would never be able to fast Ramadan till he dies maybe 20 30 years due to his illness someone who has to take medication every three hours or he has to eat and drink every six hours or he'll die for one reason or the other in this case this individual can skip Ramadan and feed after the Ramadan is over feeding 30 people poor people Muslims on for expiating what uh he missed or someone who is too old he's not sick but the guy is too old he's like have reached an old age where he cannot tolerate fasting 13 or 14 or 18 hours six seven hours and then the guy loses power and he has to eat and drink though he's healthy but this is his old age in this case this person feeds for every day he missed after the day is over or at the end of the month not before as for your mom nope she has to wait until Allah gives her health in couple of years time maybe less maybe more and then make up for these missed days [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
