  "transcript": "am I Exempted from praying in a mosque because it is about a 10minute walk and there is a huge stray dog issue at night I also don't have any other transport the from Pakistan he 16 years old he's say am I Exempted from praying in the mosque because the mosque is 10 minutes walk and at night time there are stray dogs so I Exempted normally the difference opinion whether praying in the mosque is but most of the schools of believe is some say it is for the and some scholar like imabi says if you do not pray in the mosque without a valid reason it is a he list it at 66 major sin in his book I also agreed that you should pray in the m fight of the day but according to Hadith there is a Hadith in which uh blind the prophet that because I'm blind I require a person to take me to the mosque is it okay if I pray at home then the prophet asks him that can you hear the aan he said yes then he says answer the call So based on that if on a normal morning or night if you can hear the Adan in your home then you have to answer for the call so there's no difference of opinion regarding if you can hear the Adan and 10 minutes walk I don't know the atmosphere Etc it's a 10 minutes walk I think most probably you can here because when I'm saying the mosque is even 15 minutes walk and I can hear the Adan so depending upon the atmosphere surely in the morning and the night if the 10 minutes walk and if the doubt speaker fine I think you can easily hear the Adan if you can hear the Adan there is no excuse for you not to answer to the call of the prayer even with respect to the the straight dog Etc there are many other people commuting on the road and surely you can ask some of your Muslim colleagues who are close to you maybe if they have a transport they can give you a lift you should find a way that it's possible if you can hear the Adan it become the F otherwise according to me even if you can't hear the Adan see to that you pray five times you can't take a house far away and then say because I can't hear thean it's not a f for me see to that you get a house closed or even if it's far away see to it that you pray five times the day that's very important as far as you are concerned it's better that you answer the call of the other that hope the question"
