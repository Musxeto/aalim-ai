  "title": "Ruling on rushing when Praying | Praying too Fast | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question he noticed that the people are praying in the Masjid the Sunnah or the hiatal Masjid extremely fast if they are praying extremely fast as you had described Abama roof then what they're doing is totally wrong why because there are pillars of salat and we all have to know these pillars we have to learn them and there are obligatory acts in salat and there are voluntary acts in salat we have to know the three categories so we know when our prayer is valid or invalid we know when we have to prostrate for forgetfulness or we don't etc among the pillars of the salat which was mentioned in the hadith known as el Moussa Lottie the one who does not know how to pray who came three times to the Masjid prayed two rakahs came to the prophet as Salam give Salam the Prophet replied the Salam and said go back and pray because he did not pray so the man went again and pray 2 rakaats and came gave Salam the Prophet again replied to his Salam and told him go and pray you did not pray the third time the man said o prophet of Allah teach me I don't know how to pray other than what you had seen so the prophet alayhi Salam started to teach him the pillars and every time he mentioned bowing raising up the head frustration frustration et cetera he would tell him to be calm when you bow and feel the tranquility when you bow feel the tranquility when you rise up feel the tranquility when you prostrate and it and so on so the scholar said that part of the pillars of salat is a little non-auto mean tranquility calmness to he fixed in that pillar with a sujood or ruku or sitting between the sea Jude etc to be fixed in the sense that you don't do like a chicken when it eats from the ground you take your time you prostrate you bow and this is known as to Manini the way you've described that they bow but they don't completely bound they raise their heads and while they're raising their heads to stand up they bend their knees and go for salute so actually it looks as if they are dancing the ballet not rather than praying this prayer is invalid and I've seen a lot of the people in the subcontinent unfortunately do this way of praying especially when they offer to prostrations they hit the ground and they go up they never sit straight to say rubber Philly rubber Philly they just see me touching go and go back again this is not permissible and this renders the prayer invalid because anyone who would look at them they say they are not praying now having said that it depends on your judgement because you might be a little bit extreme in judging other people's prayer to be too fast we know that the Sunna of Federer the one that you've mentioned in the first question mother Aisha used to describe to us how fast the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to pray at home and this is not a limited or a single case no this was frequently performed and done soon and ritual that the Sunnah of Roger the Prophet used to pray it fast to the extent that mother Aisha said I used to tell myself did he recite the Fatiha because it was so quick which means that not only in the recitation as the scholars say but also in prostration in the bowing position the Sunnah in soon the Hellfire is to pray it as quick as possible without jeopardizing the arc and the pillars so once saying subhanAllah barrel is sufficient allahu akbar embell fiddley once is sufficient allahu akbar subhan allah Dada is sufficient instead of saying three times or prolonging it the Sunnah is to make it fast so again your judgment has to be measured to see whether the prayer of these people you're criticizing is valid or not whether they're doing their due diligence and their fulfilling the conditions and the pillars and to what is needed or not then we can judge this and Allah surgeon knows best"
