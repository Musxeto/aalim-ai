  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s, he has a \nconfusion and a lot of the Muslims   have this similar confusion who are non-arabs why   what he's referring to is an issue of tajweed so \nwhen we write we say ash hadu i testify and la other than Allah so the article or the \npreposition or whatever you call it and   that which means that followed by a la negation \nuh uh article in writing we write it an   separate word la separate word when we say it we \nhave something called idram idram is when a silent   noon we call it the nunus is followed by one of \nthe six letters combined in the word yet so that   el the lamb and the ra are of the little uh uh um \nwords from the what the the letters from this word   so we don't say ash no we combine the n with the \nl because they're so close so we say we say Allah so if i said both ways no problem it \ndoesn't impact your salat idram if you   drop it your prayer is valid your recitation of \nthe quran is valid tajweed is not mandatory it   is not wajib it is recommended so if you skip it \nintentionally or unintentionally no problem at all you"
