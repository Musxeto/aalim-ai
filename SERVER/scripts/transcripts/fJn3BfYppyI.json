  "transcript": "uh ishraq from singapore um previously some other brothers probably asked you this question about having multiple jummahs in a mosque and you said it's not permissible since the start of kovit in singapore this has been happening to accommodate for more muslims attending the congregational prayer but what happens is there a lot of times the first session is held before the time of zohar enters so in that case should should the muslim be praying striving to pray for the first session or the second session which is after the time of the horrendous okay first of all the time of jumuah according to the majority of scholars is exactly the same as the time of lahore prayer however if we go to the authentic hadith as in muslim which was narrated by jabari abdullah and other companions may allah be pleased with them all they indicated that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to pray jumu'ah approximately half an hour or an hour before the noon time the the time the zawal time and the hadiths are clear we used to pray jumaaw with the prophet allah and come out of the masjid and the walls would not have any shade and we know that the moment it has a shade towards the uh east this is when the time of the her starts so imagine the prophet delivered the khutbah and prayed raka's of the father of jummah and they went out and the time of the was not due yet this is what made the hambali school of thought say that we can pray the we can pray jumu'ah friday prayers way before the whole time and sheikh bin baz and sheikh and epheme and other great scholars may allah have mercy on their souls said that yes friday can be prayed according to the attendees about half an hour to an hour before the whole time there's no problem in that so if the masjids in your vicinity pray this early like half an hour to an hour before the whole time you can pray with them the first jamal the second issue is i said and i've been saying this that the scholars say that repeating the friday in the same masjid twice is not permissible and i've done that in the uk before i knew it was prohibited when i used to go like five six times a year to the uk and we found that there are messages that pray one two three juma's because of the small space so when i went back and i checked with the scholars i found that they prohibit this why they say because juma should only be performed behind one imam what to do this is something beyond my pay grade it's way up over my pay grade i need to contact the major scholars once again and check with them if there is any exception due to the corona virus or due to kaffir country that has only a limited space for worshipers and they do not find a space outside to pray so what would they do maybe give me a week or two inshallah i'll try to call some of the major scholars and try to get another fatwa from them as for myself i cannot comment except according to what they had said and at this moment you"
