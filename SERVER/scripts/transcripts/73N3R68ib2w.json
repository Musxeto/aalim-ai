  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Belgium I want to know uh \nwhen I make Dua for for example in the morning   athkaar on or when I make Dua to a friend \ndo I have to pray on the prophets each time   okay now when we say the athkaar of the morning of \nthe evening or even after Salat the one who taught   them to us was the Prophet (Peace and Blessings \nUpon him) and he never told us to offer salutation   which means that salutation is to be offered \nwhen doing General Dua so if I want to make Dua   for a brother who's getting married next \nweek so I raise my hands and say [ __ ] facilitate the marriage of my brother so \nand so and make it a successful one and   bless one blah blah blah this is General \nDua but when I want to say [ __ ] I don't   offer salutation when I want to read Ayatul \nKursi after Salat I don't read the salutation   of on the prophet and I hope this \nanswers your question insha Allah and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
