  "transcript": "Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.\nShaykh, I have to attend out of necessity a lot of places where I talk with the boys, and unfortunately some of the relative women come and greet me and I accidentally look at them, and I had to reply the greeting. So since I accidentally look at them, am I sinful for that momentary gaze at them? Muslims are obliged to lower their gaze as mentioned in Surah al-Nur. Allah says, ''O Muhammad, say to the believers to lower their gaze.'' So, it is mandatory upon us as men to lower our gaze, however, sometimes it's not practical in the sense that if you're walking down the streets you need to look in front of you, and probably a woman would pass by and you cannot simply look the other way because there's another woman and the other way is there another woman, and if you look down you're going to hit the light pole. So what to do? Allah Azza wa Jal has made it easy but controlled. So the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam to the person who asked him about looking accidentally, he said, lower your gaze. And then he said to another companion, you have the first look, meaning that you're exempted from the first accidental look. But to look again, and to check her out, and to socialize, this becomes under the prohibition. So, if mothers of the children that dealing with come to talk about their children and to negotiate their education system or whatever of their affairs, you can communicate with them but you have to lower your gaze and not look them in the eyes and the face and smile and socialize because this is all haram.
