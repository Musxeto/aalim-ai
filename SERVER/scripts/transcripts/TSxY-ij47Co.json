  "transcript": "Yusuf from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So Sheikh, when I was doing ghusl today, I have the ijtihad of whenever I'm doing wudu or ghusl, it's prohibited for me to leave. I assume that. So when I was doing ghusl, in the midst of it, I was like, oh, it's prohibited for me to leave. So I just continued, you know, I just remembered. So I just washed the top. And no, I told myself, I don't know. I'm just, I just said, I don't know. But everything was washed anyways. But then when I finished ghusl, just in case, I said, no, I should have the intention to wash everything. And then I did that."
