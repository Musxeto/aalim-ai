  "title": "I used to listen to music with shirk or kufr, sometimes I hum them without the lyrics, is it kufr?",
  "transcript": "Sufyan from Algiers. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. In the past I used to play games which contain kufr like multiple gods and stuff but I repent too much in that but those songs in those games still play in my head and these songs can contain kufr words but sometimes I utter, sometimes I sing those songs but without uttering words just the beat. Does that go under kufr or not? No this is not kufr, it is sinful because it will continue to resonate in your head and the words and the lyrics are still there though you did not pronounce them but by humming the song and the music and the tunes the words are in your head and they are repeated though you did not pronounce them. So you're sinful for that but this is not kufr inshaAllah."
