  "title": "Is Vinegar made from Non Muslims Halal Is this a difference of opinion among Scholars",
  "transcript": "laden from macedonia uh sheikh my question is concerning the ruling on vinegar i've seen the opinion of scholars who say that vinegar made from wine from the non-muslims is halyal yes we have the hadith of even the hadith of who says that it's permissible to have the vinegar of except if we are sure that it was not done with a deliberate process so did the sahaba differ concerning this issue if not isn't this considered as a consensus because he says i know the difference of opinion in the making of vinegar so i would like to know was there a dispute among the the companions or they all agreed upon the narration of umar first of all i don't remember the narration of umar may allah be pleased with him whether it is authentic or not and this is a very important issue that those who study must make sure before indulging or before inserting such quotations you see in the books of fick you will find hundreds and thousands of similar codes that have been abbas said so and so even omar said so please with them all and they're great companions however when you apply the rulings of muslim and you follow the chain of narrators is it connected or not are they all authentic or not to make sure whether the hadith because this coat at the end of the day it's an ether or a hadith that needs to be verified so many times you would find that such a narration is not authentic yet people hold on to it thinking that this solves their mysteries and answer their questions therefore i cannot say on of the top of my head that yes this narration is authentic or not i have to go on back and verify it and look for it secondly even if if there were a consensus nobody would have differed upon it how would i know whether the christians or the jews who made this vinegar made it through so and so process i wouldn't know therefore the default is any vinegar i find from these countries is halal unless proven otherwise if i am certain that it was made by a muslim through fermenting or through the process of changing a juice into wine and then doing it deliberately from wine to vinegar then this would become haram but failing to know whether a muslim did this or not and failing to know whether the christian jews did it through this way because if they did it it's halal in their religion so it's halal for us as an end product that would be sufficient for you insha allah"
