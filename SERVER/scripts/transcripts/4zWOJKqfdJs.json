  "transcript": "what are the general virtues and what is the excellence pertaining to these last 10 days and nights we find ourselves in of the blessed month of ramadan the prophet was used to offer a lot of ibadah during the month of ramadan the month of ramadan is a season where people try their level best to get closer to allah azza it's a season of quran it's a season of charity it's a season of night prayer it's a season of zikr so it's a whole package deal and the prophet salallahu salaam used to try his level best during this month of ramadan however in the last 10 nights of ramadan the prophet saws would even excel further and he would the moment that the ten nights hit the prophet ali used to do things that he did not used to do before so he used to revive the whole night through dikkar quran and prayer wake up his wives and tighten up his waist wrapper which is a metaphor to not having intimacy with the wives or it is a description of what a person would do when he's about to do something physical and something hard so if you're gonna carry something or do some sort of activities you tighten your apron so that or your waist wrapper so that it would not fall down this is what the prophet used to do during the 10 nights of ramadan especially a specific beautiful ritual that the prophet would not do other than in ramadan generally speaking that is ertikaf seclusion so these ten nights the prophet hassan would seclude himself in the masjid not leave the masjid except for whatever is humanly needed such as answering the call of nature or if the food would not be brought in he would go and eat and come back that's it he would not visit a sick person he would not follow a funeral he would not go anywhere he would not have any type of intimacy with the wives 10 nights and days excluding himself in the masjid only in these last 10 nights of ramadan which highlights a lot of importance to these 10 nights and it's like when racers are engaged in a 100 meter or a thousand meter or even in a marathon when they come to the end of the race they try their level best to put everything in their power because this is what makes it or brexit so generally speaking these last 10 nights are highly valuable due to the nature due to the existence of one particular night which is not similar to any other night during the whole year where allah revealed a whole surah about the virtues of this night a full chapter of the quran telling us that it is better than a thousand months one night better than a thousand months in all aspects in forms of worship in forms of multiple uh multiplication of uh um the good deeds in the benefits one reaps out of it the whole nine yards so this is a form of putting the virtues and the benefits of these ten nights in a nutshell"
