  "transcript": "brother sent an email saying I have taken a loan from my siblings I'll take it will take me about four years to pay it off can I perform Hajj before that first of all hatch is an obligation it's a fault it's a pillar of Islam once in a lifetime if you want to increase more handle ELab but this is voluntary secondly Allah Azza WA JAL stated that this obligation of Hajj once in a lifetime is upon those who can afford it financially and physically thirdly the Prophet told us alehissalaam that when a person is martyred in the cause of Allah all of his sins are forgiven with the exception of his debts these are not forgiven he has to pay them on the day of judgment to the debtors from these evidences and a hadith we learn that a person who's going for Hajj for the first time in his life which is a pillar of Islam this is not mandatory upon him if he has a loan to pay off one would say why we say because Allah the Almighty is the one who told us that Hajj is not obligatory upon you except if you are capable financially and physically and this person is not therefore if you who want to go to Hajj if you want reward from allah azzawajal then let it be known that paying off your debts to others is more reward about at the side of a lot and performing Hajj so this is what you want to do what what is it that you want is it reward or just to satisfy yourself if it's to satisfy yourself then you're asking the wrong person if it is to please Allah Azza WA JAL and to gain reward in this case pay off your debt first and this is where a lot of the Muslims take the wrong turn when they want to do a form of worship but they have to in order to do this bend some rules or even break them so you get a woman wanting to go to Hajj and she says sure I have sufficient money and funding to go for Hajj I'm a rich woman and I'm healthy but I don't have a Muharram a male man whose relative related to me a Muharram who can accompany me for Hajj so we say you're not permitted to go she said sure I'm booking for next season's Hajj and I'm going to make Hajj without a Muharram so I said well this is not my problem this is your problem she said I want to please a life as and I say to her know by what you're doing you are pleasing your desires in self rather than pleasing Allah because Allah is pleased when you do not disobey him and going to Hajj without a Muharram is disobeying him but no one listens likewise for you when you have this debt paid off now the exception would be if your debt given to them over the next four years is on installments so your agreement with them is to pay them an X amount of money every month and your salary is sufficient and it's ongoing and by going to Hajj and coming back the monthly payment are on time in this case there is no problem for you to go for Hajj this would be accepted yet I would I recommend that even though you don't go and you try to collect the money off the hatch which might mount to two or three monthly installments and give it to the people who own it analyzer JAL knows best"
