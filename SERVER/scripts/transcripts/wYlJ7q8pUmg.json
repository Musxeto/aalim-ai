  "transcript": "belly from Bangladesh um I'm quite popular on Facebook I post Islamic stuffs and write about Islam and answer basic questions uh I have started this to gain reward and to get closer to Allah but now people loves me and they praise me so much now back in my mind my intention is not only to get reward but I want payment popularity sh I fear Allah and I want only Allah how can I fix my intention or should I stop preaching Islam as I'm doing shik here please advise me there is no shik here there is only Whispers of shatan I always give this example and this example should be your compass in life when you're praying two rakas you're getting Whispers from Shan oh I'm praying so that people would praise me and compliment me because I'm praying too slow and too nice of prayers when this idea comes to your head while praying you have two options either you break your prayer or you continue to pray there is no third option if you break your prayer Satan is happy and pleased because you obeyed him but Allah is angry because you broke your prayer and if you continue to pray Satan is angry because you disobeyed him but Allah is pleased because you you are continuing to pray and Obey him so everything in life boils down to these two choices either you pleased Allah please Allah or you please Shan your Facebook page as long as you've done it for the sake of Allah and people are benefiting it for the sake of Allah if you discontinue doing it just because you're afraid of showing off or r or likes or shik or whatever Satan is pleased Allah is angry if you continue to do it while rectifying your intention by saying I don't care about people likes I'm doing what I'm doing for Allah to be pleased with me Allah is pleased with you and the hell is withan"
