  "transcript": "azan from usa if i have enough money for hedge should i send my parents first or go first myself from the usa says if i have money and i can perform hajj on myself and i can give the money to my parents to perform hajj and delay my hajj what would you recommend the rule of thumb scholars say that whenever there is an opportunity to get closer to allah azzawajal i cannot favor others no matter who they are over myself okay this is selfish but this is a form of selfishness that is praised by allah for example i come to the masjid with an elderly or with my father and there's a gap in the front row i don't make way for him to go in because i'm in need of the reward i go in first and take that spot because this is a form of getting closer to allah azzawajal likewise although al-hajj is not immediate it can be postponed next year that five years 10 years as long as you have the ability and the intention to do it once in a lifetime although this is a fact however i do not guarantee that i'll remain alive or remain healthy or remain rich and capable of doing it therefore i come first if my parents don't have money allah did not oblige it upon them allah said that it isn't mandated upon everyone ex who has the financial and the physical means if they don't have the financial means it's not mandatory it's mandatory upon me so i have to do it and go for it for myself and allah azza knows best you"
