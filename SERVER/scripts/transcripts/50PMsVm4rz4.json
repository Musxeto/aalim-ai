  "transcript": "aiden from india if a person eats uh a meat knowing that it wasn't slaughtered in the name of allah so has he committed apostasy we have to understand the meaning of apostasy of kuffur of shirk in order for us not to fall in the traps of satan a lot of the muslims nowadays confuse these matters with their everyday tasks so if i get in my car and i don't do this or i do that have i committed kufur where is the kuffar what is the meaning of kufur this belief what is the meaning of shirk associating others in worshiping allah what is the meaning of apostasy is to reject islam or an islamic ruling that is well known by default so you tell me where is the apostasy in eating pork oh pork is a major sin i know i didn't say it's not but you have to segregate between sins and apostasy and kufur otherwise you will fall in the same traps that the khawaris fell in and this is the methodology and mindset of the hawari and also of el mortezilla who say that whoever commit a major sin he will be bound to hell fire for eternity he's a disbeliever almighty are short of calling him a disbeliever they say he's in a place between the two places but he's in hell for eternity yeah so it's beating round the bush therefore this is not permissible whoever whomever does a major sin he's sinful he's about to be punished and tormented for it but he's still a muslim if someone comes and says yeah eating pork is halal said whoa hold your horses what are you talking about said yes meat it's like beef like mutton like chicken why would it be haram i said look in the quran says it's haram in the sunnah it says it's haram said no i don't care it's halal this is an apostate this person is a kafir because he rejected a ruling unlike the other person who acknowledges that it's haram and a major sin but he falls into it due to his weakness due to following his whims and desires and allah knows best you"
