  "title": "Can you say the dua after the Athaan if I donâ€™t listen to the full Athaan? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We have Hamza from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. If you hear some of the Adhan and you don't listen to the whole Adhan, do you have to, can you still say the Dua after the Adhan which is the Allahumma Rabbaha Zid Dawati Tammah? If you don't repeat the whole phrases of the Adhan, your Dua would not be complete. Because the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam put a condition for your Dua to be answered and for the reward to take place. By saying, whenever one of you hears the Adhan and repeats after the Muadhin, meaning every phrase he says, then asks Allah for the Wasilah to be granted to me, he will get my intercession. If you failed in saying the phrases of the Adhan with the Muadhin and then you say the Dua, then the condition was not fulfilled and Allah knows best."
