  "title": "Is it Haram to put Islamic Papers on the floor or throw them away? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdullah from the U.S. My question is, can we throw away Islamic papers and put them on the floor? Like, for example, if a paper has chronic text or pieces of the sunnah on them? To do what with them? Like, can we throw them away or put them on the floor? No. If there is a piece of paper that has Qur'anic verses or the names or one of the names of Allah in Arabic, it has to be respected and honoured. So you cannot just throw them in the dustbin or disrespect them. Rather, it should be respected. You want to dispose of it? You can shred them beyond recognition, you can burn them, or you can bury them."
