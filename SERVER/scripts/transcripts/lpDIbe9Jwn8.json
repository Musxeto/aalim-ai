  "transcript": "from Pakistan my question is is it permissible to pray in a a t-shirt that like when you go into the the t-shirt's um bottom part like hangs down and you can uh and the top part and you can uh potentially see the a of the person so would it be permissible to pray in a t-shirt what is the half from the uh navl to the knee and and does the T-shirt cover that uh while standing yes but when you going into or it hangs down and you might be able to see the a from the top or bottom no you will not see the a because your pants usually are to your Naval so your pants will cover your a not your T-shirt and even if it hangs down and you can see which is unheard of when people making or they go and do this to look inside their uh uh t-shirt this is negligible and forgiven and Allah Knows Best"
