  "transcript": "accidentally with the english r sound while i was like able to repeat it with the actual arabic raw but then i didn't i didn't do that because i was worried my my prayer would become invalid due to intentionally adding uh vajav act which is my prayer first of all if you rectify a mistake and you repeat it this has no impact on the validity of your prayer if i say subhana rabbi al-azim and this is not right a lot of the muslims say azeem and this is wrong it's our veim you have to stick your tongue out if someone says azim and then wants to rectify it and repeat the correct thing this has no impact on your on his prayer saying allahu akbar or this is the same it does not impact the validity of your prayer so even if you don't repeat it it is valid insha allah you"
