  "title": "Adding ALLAH HUMMA to Dua permissible? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Shamsul from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I pray that you and your family are well and in good health And you as well, Barakallah Feek My question is that I really want Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala to accept my duas so I try to ask them in the times according to the Sunnah. So for example between the Iqamah and Adhan in Sujood and before we say the Salam and sometimes when I hear sometimes the Imam when he says the dua he adds Allahumma to it. So for example, I learned the dua And sometimes I hear people saying Allahumma Rabbana Zalamna So does this Allahumma adding that to a dua, does that increase the chances? Is this innovation or something like that? There's nothing wrong with that Shamsul because it's like saying Ya Allah, Ya Rabbana So you're adding names of Allah Azzawajal So Allahumma is equivalent to Ya Allah Allahumma Ghafirli Warhamni Or Ya Allah Ghafirli Warhamni Rabbi Ghafirli Warhamni It's the same thing So adding it does not increase your chances of being answered or your dua being fulfilled But it is a form of glorifying Allah Azzawajal Allah knows best"
