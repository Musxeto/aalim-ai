  "title": "How the hypocrites do their work and how to deal with them? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "So, if you read Surah Al-Baqarah, Allah speaks in the first 2-3 ayahs about Al-Mu'mineen, and then 2-3 ayahs about Al-Kuffar, and then 8-9 ayahs about Al-Murafiqeen, about the hypocrites. The hypocrites are everywhere, and in the beginning, there were no hypocrites in Mecca. Why? Because Islam was weak. When they went to Medina and Islam became strong, then the hypocrites appeared. Whenever Islam is strong, hypocrisy becomes widely spread because they are enemies of Islam. They cannot attack Islam, because if they attack Islam, people will fight with them. So what to do? They work from underground. They put doubts in your head about Islam. Oh, this is not hadith sahih. No, hadith is not good. We only believe in Quran. What about the hadith? No, no, hadith may be corrupt, may be this. We don't believe in hadith. We are Quraniyoon. We believe only in the Quran. Whoever believes in the Quran and rejects Sunnah is a kafir. I don't have to sugarcoat it, because Allah says in the Quran, you have to follow the Prophet and you have to follow the Sunnah. Whoever goes against the Prophet and follows other than the way of the believers, we will put him in hell. So we have to know that the hypocrites, they will come and try to undermine Islam. How to deal with them? We have to expose them. We have to show the people that this is against Islam without giving takfir. We're not ISIS. We don't give takfir. But we have to expose them. Allah says in the Quran, you should identify the hypocrites in the way they speak. You can tell that they're using crooked ways when they speak. They don't speak, they try to undermine Islam. So we have to expose them. We have to show in the media, whatever allegations they present, we put counter allegations. Because the jihad of the kuffar is with the sword. The jihad of the hypocrites is with the tongue and with the pen. So this is the role of the ulama, the scholars. Whenever there is an attack on Islam, they come and clarify this for the Muslims."
