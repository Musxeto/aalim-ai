  "transcript": "Muhammad from Switzerland Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my wife knows some girl that wants to marry and she wanted me to present her to a friend of mine and so I told him about her, she told the girl about my friend some informations but this girl wants to know more about him before he gets to contact her father or goes directly seeing him So her question is can she talk with him in the group chat when I'm present and my wife or he has to go to her father directly before everything and she can do that What you're asking about brother Muhammad is totally prohibited Akhi This girl is an unmahram to you as well as to this friend of yours Being in a group chat where your wife would be able to read how this person is communicating and dealing and when you are capable of reading how your wife's friend is replying and gets to know you get to know her character, how do you guarantee that you won't fall in love with such a girl or your wife falls in love with your friend's responses and she thinks whoa this guy is a gentleman compared to my husband The way he speaks is so much in sync with what I want my husband to be What my husband is unfortunately doesn't brush his teeth and his belly is like two feet ahead of his chest and he has so many bad things but this guy is whoa his profile picture Akhi what is this? This is totally prohibited for you to facilitate such communication between non-mahram behind the back of her father and this shows that this woman is not that modest because if she had this dignity of a muslimah and the honor of a muslimah she would not ever allow any such communication to take place behind the back of her parents behind the back of her wali, her guardian and Allah azawajal knows best Thank you"
