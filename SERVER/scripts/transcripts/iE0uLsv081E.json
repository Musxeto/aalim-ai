  "transcript": "an anonymous questioner says what's the concept of voting in Islam how to choose if all the candidates are non-muslims or one is the Muslim and he's corrupt but his opponent is a non-muslim but fair first of all democracy is on Islamic so you have to believe and understand this the concept of democracy the concept of voting is totally honest la m'q it is against the religion of Islam to have a parliament session where they want to cast the ballot or a vote over the consumption of intoxicants or opening brothels and where and houses prostitution or on the permissibility of usury or teaching homosexuality would it democracy whatever the people want subhanAllah this is totally against Islam in a funny clip I saw in a Arab country claiming to be Muslim that they are voting on selling wine and intoxicants in the country so they're giving their boat they're giving their votes and then the head of the Parliament says we will adjourn this session because now it's time for a van and awesome and we will convene afterwards what I then and what hassle are you guys talking about you're totally going against the religion of Allah Allah tells you that intoxicants are prohibited so avoid it may you prosper and you say we will see what the people want if you see what the people want that goes against what Allah wants this is blasphemous so the concept of democracy in voting in general is not accepted and and why do I say in general because sometimes it can be accepted as forms of Shura of consulting others which is not binding but we take their decision and consider it for example in my family I'll gather the children hypothetically that is and ask them I want to buy a new car I have this car and I have this station wagon which one do you think is best and they give their votes and I tell them okay I'll go with the majority there's no problem in that this is not voting on an issue that concerns the whole Ummah or that is related to religion in selecting who leads the country because this is related to religion it's not for the general masses to choose sometimes they vote for an actor they vote for a prostitute a member of the Parliament was voted and she was a porn star what is this so well this is what the masses want so if the masses come tomorrow and say we would like to legitimize incest a man can marry his wife his daughter or his sister and we would the people say there is nothing wrong in that this is blasphemous when they channel and legalize same-sex marriages or LGBT or homosexuality and they enforce people to learn it at school this is blasphemous because they are challenging the the law of Allah they're challenging Sharia and for Muslims this takes you out of the fold of Islam but as I stated that democracy is out of the question if I live in a country unfortunately that believes in democracy and they're calling people to vote and when we look at the candidates we find that there is a corrupt disbeliever and a Muslim who is trying to do good I know that this process is wrong but if I don't put my weight behind the Muslim candidate and if all Muslims stay back and refrain from voting the corrupt disbeliever would win in this case to ward off the worst of the two evils I have to vote not that I believe in the system but rather just to minimize the damage and likewise if I have a corrupt Muslim he's a Muslim but he's corrupt like some of the leaders in Muslim countries who claim to be Muslim yet he goes to Hindu temples he goes to the Buddhist temples he wears like them he dances like them he acts like them and he says that this is part of the job description I would have Billa he's corrupt and I have a non Muslim who is well known his track record is being fair being honest being clean and he would do well for the country definitely I would tell you vote for the non-muslim because this corrupt Muslim would only deteriorate Islam in our country"
