  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Qatar my question is uh   I am not a social person so if I lose contact \nwith people for no reason like for example I had   I won't I wouldn't say friends like I had \nrelations with the people in the past and   as I wanted to become a religious person I lost \ncontact with them intentionally and they are   not bad people they are a Muslim they pray but I \njust wanted to improve myself so I lost contact   with them intentionally so after a long time \nthey called me and like they keep telling me yes that why don't you contact with and I got \nmy driver's license and then I don't think   it's the sin because as far as I'm concerned \nProphet (Peace and Blessing Upon Him) said so I have I I did not abandon you \nI do not have any enmity towards okay your line is breaking but I got your question \nokay the Hadith you've quoted is correct this is   when I have beef with other Muslim and we disagree \non something and we have an argument and we have a   fight then I boycott him for three days in the \nsense that I may see him in the mall or in the   street and I look the other way for three days not \ngiving Salam there's no problem in that but after   three days if I see him on the fourth day I have \nto initiate salaam by saying assalamu alaikum even   if I still hate his guts and he has to reply and \nif he uh initiated the Salam I have to reply this   is a mandatory there's no choices I have gazillion \nfriends that I don't contact for 10 years 20 years   life is short and each and every one \nof us have lots lots of things to do   I have total respect and love for them but \nI don't have time to see them is that okay   there's no problem imagine if someone calls me \nwould I hang up definitely not would I not pick   up the call definitely not if he invites me \nwould I attend Maybe depending on my schedule   but what you're doing is not a positive \nthing and a lot of the brothers once they   are committed to the the religion and they \nstart to practice shaytan messes up with   their head and makes them isolate themselves \nfrom the society from their friends from their   colleagues sometimes from their loved ones from \ntheir relatives why I want to better myself   I want to elevate myself to a higher level \nI want to be righteous and practicing and a   student of knowledge that's a good thing but this \nis the wrong way you can't be more righteous and   practicing than the Prophet (Peace and Blessing \nUpon Him) and if you go to his seerah you will   find that the Prophet (Peace and Blessing Upon \nHim) used to mix with everybody would attend   any invitation he's given even by a Jew woman she \ninvites him to eat from a ram that she cooked he   tells his companions let's go no problem a woman \nwith mentally who's mentally challenged takes an   appointment from him comes and takes his hand and \ndrags him in the streets of Medina complaining   about what her folks and relatives are doing \nto her and he's going with her so he wasn't the   type of saying oh I don't have time I don't want \nto meet people I don't want to mix with people   beside that imagine the benefit you can get and \ngain when you go and meet these folks who love you   and have respect to you and you throw gems from \nthe Quran and from the Sunnah they never knew   before and they're hearing it for the first time \nand they adopt it and start practicing it and you   the following days or months on your bed sleeping \nwhile getting rewards countlessly because of the   things you've said in half an hour when you \nhad a meeting with them but you did not pay   attention to it you're depriving yourself from \na great source of rewards so I would highly   advise to balance your time to prioritize \nyour relationships and keep the bridges   running and and live instead of burning all \nbridges with people though you don't have any   enmity or any uh grudges against them but still \npeople would like to see you every now and then"
