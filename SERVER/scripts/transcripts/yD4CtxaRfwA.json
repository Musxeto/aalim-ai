  "transcript": "Khalilullah from the KSA Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Naam Sheikh, so we understand as a Muslim that if someone gathers his wealth through haram when truly he doesn't know it's haram by the time he knows it's haram and he truly repents to Allah all those wealth inshallah Allah will convert it to halal for him but in a situation where someone who knows was informed that this thing you're doing it's haram and he doesn't stay away from it and after some month after he has gathered some wealth and he later realized that oh I need to repent back to Allah those wealth he has gathered when he knows that those things haram doesn't need to let go of them or he can keep those wealth as long as he knows that his earning is haram what he saves from it is still haram he's already acknowledging that it was haram but still sells alcohol he still deals with entertainment material he still sells tobacco and he doesn't care so whatever he accumulated is haram and he has to dispose of such haram wealth"
