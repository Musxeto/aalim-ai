  "title": "Working in a call center with a FAKE American name, is my income halal? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "ahmad says i work in pakistani call centers when we get calls from american citizens we pretend and give our name as alex andrew etc is that okay and the salary we get is haram or unfortunate but changing the first name there's no problem so instead of calling myself awesome and i nicknamed myself as uh andrew or alex there's nothing haram in it especially when most likely the one on the other end of the call knows that you're not andrew or alex and you're not in the uk or from the us and it's a call center in pakistan or in india so it seems that changing the first name is permissible and your earning is you"
