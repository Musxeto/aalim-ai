  "transcript": "from Italy a yeah if I want to take a pollution I'll use the prayer and I take 10 months it is totally prohibited to perform just because you're afraid of missing the congregation or missing the time of the prayer so even if I wake up late one minute Before Sunrise and I know if I go and make wudu I will be faced with the Sun rising so can I do tell your mom the answer is no is a substitute is something that Allah has offered us in case there is no water available or we would encounter hardship or harm if we were to use water and neither cases apply for you for coming late so even if you come late and find out that you will miss the congregation there is no problem in that missing the congregation but as long as you fulfill the conditions make wudu and come back insha Allah [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
