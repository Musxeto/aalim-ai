  "title": "Was the Prophet ‎ﷺ loud? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "So, was the Prophet ﷺ a person who's described as loud? So that we know people when they speak in gatherings, they're so loud, they're so dominant you can't hear anything except what they say. Was he like this? Well, Al-Muqdad, may Allah be pleased with him, says whenever the Prophet ﷺ entered a gathering or a room or a hall he would give the salam to a level that someone who's awake can hear, but someone who's asleep would not be awakened by. So the Prophet's tone was very moderate and very delicate. He would not enter like every time we're in the masjid, especially in Ramadan, before prayer time or during, between Adhan and Iqama, people come into the masjid, As-Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah, why are you shouting? Why are you giving salam as if you're the Imam for everybody? And this is not a single person, you get like 50, 70 people coming in, everybody's shouting his head off. This is not from the Sunnah. Yes, if you come and pray two rak'ahs and there's someone you know, you privately say As-Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah, shake hands, no problem with that. But the Prophet when he entered the room, he would say As-Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah, so those who awake can hear, but those who are asleep would not be bothered by his salam."
