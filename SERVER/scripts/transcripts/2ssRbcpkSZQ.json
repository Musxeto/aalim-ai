  "transcript": "next question is from brother abdul muiz can i read more than four just a day is it permissible as i heard that you can only read four just a day no this is totally uh uh baseless you can read more than four just a day and some scholars limit it to 10 a day so that you finish it once every three days and some say the best is to finish it once every week and some say once every 10 days meaning three years a day but alhamdulillah you have up to 10 jesus a day if you wish so that you can finish the quran every three days"
