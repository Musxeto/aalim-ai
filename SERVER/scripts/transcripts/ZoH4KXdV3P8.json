  "transcript": "[Music] my question is currently i am um i am on a vacation to bangladesh and most of my relatives are here so my question is that um because i'm sure you're quite familiar with that people here they tend to remakes among the relatives and stuff like that how do i approach the dhara to them to to say that you know that this is wrong and in any other matters as well how do i actually approach with wisdom so that i can spread the message as well as not be rude or not um cut ties among let's say the female relatives and so on i will answer from singapore how do i make um to my relatives when i visit them back home in bangladesh when they have different beliefs they fall into sins innovations well there is no one size that fits all the main principle is that you protect yourself first and foremost don't be like a candle that burns itself in order to give others light no conserve your energy and your good deeds and don't fall into sins don't free mix just to give dawah don't compromise and shaking hands with the opposite gender just so that they wouldn't say that oh islam is a a a moderate intolerant religion i wouldn't shake hands with the opposite gender just to make them happy who cares about them i follow my religion my conviction i have quran i have sunna even if the whole of europe is against me who cares let them go to hell with all due respect because i follow my religion i will not abandon my religion just so that i could get one of the boxes checked and a thumbs up for what i had done i follow islam that's it full stop so if you can't give dawah to them without compromising your religion go ahead if not then you have to improvise emails to the or and to the same gender phone calls smses throw a party only for the same gender and make dua for them and allah knows best you"
