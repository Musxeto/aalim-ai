  "transcript": "Medina from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So I want to ask if jogging outside is all right or like for example if I jog in like a fitness studio where like little men are or like just some men are? No, this is not permissible at all for a woman to do. No matter how protective she is, a woman when she's out, shaytan raises her so that men would look at her and she would be a cause of fitna for them all. Imagine a woman running, no matter how ample the clothes are, her body curves, body parts would shake and wiggle and jump around no matter what she's trying to conceal and protect, it's a fitna. For anyone just to see a woman walking, it's their imagination, it's the illness in their hearts. So no, this is not permissible. Save a little bit, buy a treadmill, it takes only one meter by one and a half meter in your home and you can run your head off there inshaAllah."
