  "title": "What is the benefit of reciting Ayatul Kursi if I can still end up in Hell ??? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The first caller is Ammar from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, my question is, I read on one of your questions and answers that someone asked about reading Ayatul Kursi after the Fard prayer and if that person commits a major sin, in your reply you said that it is possible for that person to go to hell, to get purified and then enter Jannah. So my question was, if I religiously, after every prayer, if I read Ayatul Kursi, then what's the benefit? Because if a person who does not read, there's a possibility of him also ending in hell and if I also read it, there's a possibility of me also ending in hell, May Allah protect us. But to get purified, so what's the benefit of reading Ayatul Kursi in that situation? First of all, we do not deal with Allah Azza wa Jal like we deal with traders and merchants. One plus one equals two. It is not like this. We are in need of Allah and of His mercy and we cannot calculate things and say, okay, I did Umrah and this expiates and erases everything in the past, so I have credit to make sins in the future. Secondly, the Hadith is authentic. Whoever recites Ayatul Kursi after each Fard, nothing will come between him and entering Jannah except death. Now, this Hadith is authentic and we have a number of scenarios. If I abide by your logic to this Hadith and say, I have a carte blanche, so I can go clubbing tonight, I can go for a one night stand, I can drink booze, I can lie and cheat and business as usual, I will go to Jannah. This is scenario number one. Do you believe in this? Because if you do, then we have a problem. Scenario number two is the Hadith is authentic, but we understand it as if someone avoids major sins and hence minor sins are forgiven with the grace of Allah and we avoid major sins as the Hadith between whatever is between Umrah to Umrah, Ramadan to Ramadan, the five daily prayers, is forgiven as long as you avoid major sins. So we can understand this Hadith of Ayatul Kursi in this way and this is one of the ways of understanding it, but certainly it is not an endorsement for entering Jannah regardless of what you do of major sins. No one in his right mind would think like this because you just imagine the consequences of me praying five times a day, religiously observing to read Ayatul Kursi afterwards and I do the whole major sins that are found in the book, counting that all will be erased and gone and I will go straight to Jannah. This doesn't work unfortunately or fortunately, otherwise we would be living in chaos and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
