  "transcript": "Mohammed says that there is a couple on Instagram with loads of followers who knowingly or unknowingly are promoting evil in the name of halal romance the post they post their photos and videos the woman wears the niqab and show their private life the man sings the woman jumps and so on and when reminded they say that there is no problem with that for it is halal way unfortunately many young practicing Muslims are fooled and they follow them and they watch it so what's the ruling Islam is based on bashfulness it's based on Al hiya the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam Eman meaning the belief is seventy plus branches the highest is la ilaha illaallah the lowest is removing obstacles that are harmful from people's way and bashfulness is part of Eman and the prophet alayhi salatu salam saw a man talking to his friend telling him come on don't be shy try to be a blunt try to be straightforward try to be courageous being shy being bashful is not befitting through the Prophet Ali Saleh so I'm said to him leave him for bashfulness brings only goodness al hiya Aleya t Allah be higher bashfulness brings only goodness now if you show these Instagram posts to Imams of messages to scholars of Islam to prominent dairies and you see what they're doing singing acting without any restrictions the woman even if she's wearing the niqab doing moves and things that are not befitting of a Muslim woman to do in public can she do what she does on the streets or on the theatre she says no definitely not why not she says this is not normal so what you're doing an Instagram and being followed by a hundred thousand five hundred thousand few millions is even worse so what they're doing is actually tarnishing the reputation of Islam as a man and a wife you between you yourselves you can do whatever you want the sky's the limit nobody says anything wrong about that what's wrong is when you come and do it in public and imagine if someone gives you the evil eye and say wow they're so in love Wow and immediately something bad happens because of that why are you doing so such things most likely they are Fame seekers you get people stripping on Instagram you get people eating weird things on Instagram you get people jumping and harming themselves on Instagram why because they want Fame and fame seekers usually end up in hell unless Allah has mercy over them because they do things that tarnish their religion and their reputation and I always give you this story that a man was captured in the hajj season trying to put some human waste on the Kaaba so they captured him before he spoiled the Kaaba and they took him to the judge after beating the heck out of him and the judge asks him subhanAllah what were you thinking aren't you a Muslim he said yes I am a Muslim so why then were you trying to spoil and tarnish the Kaaba with dirt and filth and nudges he said I wanted to be remembered by the people and I wanted them to mention my name even if they curse me so they would say Oh so-and-so may Allah curse him and he becomes famous and popular even through if through being cursed so seeking Fame even if as if someone has a long beard of a woman or a woman wearing niqab this doesn't mean a thing so many deviant and evil people have long beards and this doesn't mean that they are pious or righteous what counts is their actions Allah Azza WA JAL told us and the Prophet as I am told us in Sahih Muslim that Allah does not look at your physique and how much you possess your wealth rather Allah looks at your hearts and your actions and these actions that are being done by this couple in Instagram or one or wherever this is totally against Islam and it's not befitting for a Muslim"
