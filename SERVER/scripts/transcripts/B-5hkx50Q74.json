  "title": "Do Wet Dreams require Ghusl (ritual bath) for men and women? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "this questioner did not state his name what's the ruling of wet dreams in Islam for both men and women such questions are quite ambiguous what's the ruling the ruling usually is either one of five and this is called or known as a calm attack lifia which means that whatever you do is either mandatory or prohibited or highly recommended mr. hub or disliked makrooh or the fifth category which is permissible these are the five rulings on things that we do so when you say what is the ruling of wet dreams this is involuntary it's called nocturnal emission and this happens without you being able to control it it happens where while a person is asleep so there is no sin on him or her but if you are asking about what follows having won then this is a different issue if a person goes to bed and wakes up he has one of two conditions either he finds something in his or her underwear which is the result of ejaculation which is semen or they don't find anything if they found traces of semen whether they remember seeing an erotic dream or not they have to perform hustle because the Prophet told us honey salatu salam that whenever you see semen you have to take ocean so it doesn't matter whether a person saw a dream or not an erotic dream that is the second type is when you wake up and you find no traces of semen yet you remember clearly that you had intercourse and that you had ejaculated in your dream but you woke up and did not see anything in this case you do not have to and you must not perform oasl because the cause and the reason of whistle is the emission of semen it is ejaculating and because this did not take place then there is no no whistle on you one may also ask do I have to perform also immediately after waking up as it is no if it's not time for you to pray for example if someone wakes up after fajar and there is like five or six hours to the whole time so is he obliged to perform whistle immediately the answer's no he can remain awake he can or she can cook go out shopping sit etc them cannot pray they cannot touch the quran and they must not recite the quran in the state of sexual impurity major sexual or ritual impurity other than that they can behave and act normally"
