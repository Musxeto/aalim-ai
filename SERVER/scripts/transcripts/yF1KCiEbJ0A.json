  "transcript": "misha from bangladesh she says that there are people who claim that al-qaeda and the nicest the non-islamic state of israel of israel of iraq and syria they are mujahideen so what to do and what to talk about they are not mujahideen come on they are terrorists and the impact of what they had done how they changed the whole world how they intimidated everybody including the muslims it's not focused on the non-muslims even the muslims were negatively impacted by their actions and their missions muslims have died sectarian violence has increased they have no legitimacy they have no islamic flag they have no muslim ruler backing them up so they are rebels renegades or in the islamic terminology they are they kill the innocent and leave the culprits they focus their attacks on the muslims and accuse the muslims of being far disbelievers while the enemies of islam are in safe hands nobody is touching them and they have nothing related to islam all what they have done tarnished the reputation of islam worldwide and this is what serves the targets and the plans and the strategy of the enemies the true enemies of islam therefore anyone claiming that they are mujahideen such people are ignorant in islam have zero knowledge in islam they are people who are thinking with hate and wanting destruction not knowing how to channel such emotions according to the quran the sunnah because this is not the way of the prophet this is not the way of the companions so which religion are you following discriminately killing innocent people blowing up places hijacking airplanes or doing whatever terrorist attacks you want to do now we have to admit that not everything attributed to them is true but they are a terrorist or they are both terrorist organizations but the enemies of islam again and the intelligence agencies add a lot of spices that serves their agenda so if there is a an earthquake ah this is this terrorist organization or that and this means that because they cause this earthquake we should rampage their masjids and islamic centers and ban the nihab and anyone with beard we put them in jail and and make a crosscheck on them ah so it's not terror that you are fighting it is islam and this is what we see in europe clearly that is happening but this doesn't mean that we endorse what these terrorist groups are doing no we condemn them every muslim condemns them but at the same time we are not stupid we know that these countries make a lot of plotting and strategizing to incriminate these people and lead them to do such things and hence tarnish the reputation of islam we know that these countries prohibit the spread of true islam true knowledge of the quran sunnah true scholars coming to teach so that they would promote violence and they would eradicate true islam and following the sunnah and this what happens even in some muslim countries so go back to the real scholars go back to the quran the sunnah follow the way of the prophet allah and you will be in good hands in sha allah"
