  "transcript": "in alhamdulillah m [Music] [Music] in for it was reported in Muslim narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him that our Prophet Sall alai wasam said people will enter Paradise with Hearts like the hearts of birds we all know that the prophet was given the concise of speech limited number of words have a huge profound meaning and this is why it's an obligation upon us to study each and every word that the prophet Alat am said because this is your way to Paradise this is your means of guidance in this life and in the Hereafter so the prophet sallu alai wasallam told us about a group of his umah who will enter jenah due to the fact that their hearts are similar to the hearts of birds so why birds why not animals why not insects why not fish well birds are mentioned in the Quran a lot and though they are among the living creatures that do not speak like us and known in Arabic as Alim the beasts that do not speak yet in many cases they are better than humans Allah says in the Quran or do you think that most of them hear or reason they are not except like livestock these disbelievers are not nothing except like livestock like animals rather they are even more more astray in their way so the animals are better than them so what is so special about the birds birds are better than many humans they know what is right and what is wrong Allah tells us in the Quran about theu the bird that spoke to Prophet this bird roamed the Earth and came back with special news this bird said indeed I found there a woman ruling them and she has been given of all things and she has a great Throne I found her and her people prostrating to the Sun instead of Allah and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from his way from Allah's way so they are not guided Subhan Allah a bird that knows what's right and what's wrong how many of the Muslims today who have feelings that went numb who the ritual of enforcing virtue and righteousness and forbidden forbidding evil and vice this beautiful ritual had died in their hearts while in the hearts of birds it's still living and thriving and going strong Birds fill the whole world with Vick with glorifying Allah with exalting Allah while we humans fill the whole world with music with sins with things that anger Allah Asel where is the comparison Allah says and we subjected the mountains to exalt us along with the wood peace be upon him and also the birds the mountains that would peace be upon him and the birds exalt and glorify Allah also the hearts of birds are filled with on Allah asael they depend trust and rely only on Allah in all of their Affairs especially when they want provision the prophet saysat if you all depend on Allah with due Reliance he would certainly give you Provisions as he gives it to the birds who go forth hungry in the morning and return with full bellies at dusk this is a promise from the prophet if you depend on Allah rely on him and have your full trust he will provide for you and this is one of the major reasons for being admitted to Jenna so those who are admitted to Jenna with hearts like the hearts of birds they have full the prophet says 70,000 people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts without Reckoning and they are those who do not ask others for R they don't go to people and say I'm sick please do R for me no they trust Allah they don't ask of people and they do not believe in bad Omens Nothing Stops them from going out a dead cat an accident no they believe in Allah they trust Allah and they gone and the prophet says Alam and they put their trust in their lord these are the characteristics of the 70,000 who would enter Jenna without recording or account what about how we trust Allah many of us don't have this trust or how would you explain why people take bribes and take payment from under the table how do you explain Muslims who deal in Haram and sell Haram and cheat and lie just to get an extra din what Paradise is such a person having hope in entering among the features and the treats and the character istics of the hearts of birds that it is filled with fear always you will find Birds on their toes no one can ever sneak behind the bird and you can see this the moment they feel or sense any movement you find them running or flying or moving away this is how the their hearts were created filled with fear and this is how the heart of a Muslim should be a Muslim is always terrified and Afraid over a sin he did in the past doesn't know if Allah has forgiven or not all of our sins that we've committed no one can gives us a guarantee that ohas you've repented Allah forgave you no we're always afraid that Allah may not have accepted our repentance and we're afraid of an upcoming sin that we will do in the future what is going to happen to us are we going to die on Islam are we going to continue to be steadfast on our religion or is our heart going to flip and turn turn away from this beautiful religion and will end up doomed in Hell Fire may Allah protect us the vast majority of us Muslims barge in to do sins without any fear as if we are the chosen people we do sins in our homes we do sins in our offices we do sins everywhere we go the people of paradise never do such a thing because they fear Allah so you tell me are our hearts filled with fear of Allah Asel or we are heedless and neglectful listen to this Ayah where Allah tells us about the people of Hell indeed those who do not accept those who do not expect the the meeting with us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure therein and those who are heedless of our signs for those their Refuge will be the fire because of what they used to earn may Allah protect us alhamd some of us may have hearts like the hearts of birds in the sense that the hearts of birds are pure are clean are merciful and compassionate some of us have seen this they are so merciful that sometimes they can be more merciful for a child that does not belong to them more than the mercy of his own mother their hearts are fragile they're soft they see something on TV they start to weep and cry because their hearts are connected with Allah the hearts of True Believers are pure they're empty of any malice hatred Grudge Envy transgression it's pure and such people will enter Jenna they have no arrogance they have no Pride they feel that everyone is better than them for the sake of Allah the prophet saysat shall I I tell you of the people of paradise they comprise every poor humble person and if he that poor humble person swears by Allah to do something Allah will make it happen so this poor and humble person is the one who is submissive to Allah Asel has no arrogance over the people doesn't see himself better than others he has given up hope in his own power in his own might and gave that all to the power and Allah's might and this is the person whose all of his Affairs are on the straight path following Allah's commands according to the Quran and to the Sunnah his heart is free from doubts it's free from illicit and Haram desires and whims that is what that is why he's qualified big time to enter Allah's Paradise so me and you should ask ourselves are we our wives our children among those qualified to enter Jenna are our hearts similar to the hearts of birds are days on this Earth are limited no doubt we were born to die and we are heading to our destination there is nothing stopping us but it's only a matter of time when is the Angel of Death going to approach us so if we do not purify our hearts and make it to the best of our ability as the hearts of birds pure by denouncing evil and vice by having full trust Reliance and dependence only on Allah by filling our hearts with fear of Allah fear of Hellfire fear of our sins by purifying our hearts from malice from hatred from racism from arrogance from transgression and op oppressing others if we fail miserably in doing all of this then we w we have lost this life and we have lost the hereafter muh Al"
