  "title": "Layman claiming a Hadith is weak (praying 2 rakat after sunrise?) || assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "missb from India uh in one of your videos you have mentioned about the reward of praying two raats of Sunnah after the sunrise while staying at M where we will get reward of and I searched about this and you quot I searched about this in in.com and I also verified in had verification group it found out to be an is there any specific group on following who said who said it's AI I said.com who is sunnah.com uh it's it's a reliable website I do you know them do you know any one of them no I don't know so is this possible that you depend on a website that you don't know who runs it you don't know who are the scholars in it you don't have any recommendation of Scholars saying that this is a trusted uh website whenever they say you go for it so with all due respect to sunnah.com I don't know the the website and I do not rely on it at all I Rely entirely on Islam qa. info this is the and no one doubts this no one challenges this this is the most visited website Islamic website on Earth in the past nine months from the beginning of the hijri year to the month of Ramadan it was visited by 101 million visits 101 and we still have three months to go in this hijri year and it is the most trusted website regarding Islamic Sciences this is what I depend upon secondly in the of Hadith we are Layman so we have to depend on a sheh who we follow in whatever he tells us for example in are you a student of knowledge you're going to say no MB is going to say no I don't know Arabic I don't memorize the Quran I have not finished the books of I don't have any knowledge of and their likes so I'm not a student of knowledge I'm a Layman so when you want to take your verdicts of Halal andam or understand something related to Shar who do you follow you say oh I follow he's my Im so this is the right approach for a Layman we as layman in the science of Hadith we follow Al albani and albani authenticated the Hadith among other Scholars of Islam so we follow this Hadith and implement it in addition to the fact that the prophet wasam and his companions used to do this in the Masjid every day now let's assume that the Hadith is not authentic it's sufficient for us that the prophet would not go back home until the the sun rises and his wives as in many hadiths used to pray fer and sit on their prayer mat until the sun rises so yeah at least that would be something helpful instead of just crossing it out and saying the Hadith is according to XY Z whom I don't know that is not a healthy sign and Allah Knows Best"
