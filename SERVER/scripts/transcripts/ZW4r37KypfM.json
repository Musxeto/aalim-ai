  "transcript": "a sister says after my period I have brown discharge and do not see any sign of purity nay neither dryness nor white discharge my question is when should I start praying and should I continue praying while I have this brown discharge well the answer is when a woman has her menstruation usually she does this for six to seven days and then the flow of the blood stops she cannot perform motion until she sees the sign of purity and the sign of purity is either detected by a white thread like discharge that comes white and has no colors accompanying it or by what is known as total dryness so when wiping nothing appears on the paper if this is the case then this is a sign of her purity and she must perform motion but if she doesn't see neither and she only sees brownish discharge in this case she has to wait until she sees one of the two signs of purity what happened if she doesn't then the ultimatum is completing 15 days once she completes 15 days of not praying 7 of her menses and 8 for the color discharges then she performs social and considers these brown discharges as st haba analyzer which L knows best"
