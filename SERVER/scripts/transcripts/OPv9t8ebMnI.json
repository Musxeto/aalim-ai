  "transcript": "unsafe from india what is the proof from the sunnah that is from the prophet peace be upon him or the companions about doing rook here using water there isn't any proof on this issue from the sunnah of the prophet there are indications that the tabirin used to do some of the taberine used to do it now the concept of rookia is it affirmative in the sunnah or not yes the concept of blowing dry spitting when making rookia especially before going to bed or when a person is ill or when doing it for a patient is it authentic from the sunnah the answer is yes drinking zamzam water as a form of healing and a cure of our illnesses is it authentic in sunnah the answer is yes this is what called some scholars to say that doing rookia is something permissible it's not prescribed it's any dua you make and you blow and this is what i mentioned a little bit earlier if you remember that the prophet said that show me your rookia and he used to in uh direct people to make rookie not by specifically choosing this and that and this and that rather general rookie as long as there is dua as long as long as you're invoking allah azzawajal therefore the salaf of the taberean and so forth when they said make rookie over zamzam water and if not available then any water or olive oil and drink it or rub it on the places that need healing they have applied the general rulings and the concept of permissibility over rookia which the prophet had given and allah azza knows best you"
