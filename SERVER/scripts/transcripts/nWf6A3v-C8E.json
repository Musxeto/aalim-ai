  "transcript": "Suleyha from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. On 21st, 23rd, 25th and so on dates the imam only pray eight rakat Taraweeh after Isha and then two hours before Fajr another imam pray with her in my husband's masjid. Should he pray with her at home with me or should he pray to attend the reward of praying whole night and Sheikh my family loves you, Allah guided us through you. Jazakallahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum and I pray to Allah Azza Wa Jal that he makes your families and our families and the viewers families all steadfast on the Quran and the Sunnah and implementing it in their lives so that Allah would grant them this Hidayah, this light in this life and in the hereafter. Ameen. As for your question Suleyha, when a masjid has one or more imams, the collective number of imams act as one. For example, in Al-Haram whether in Mecca or in Medina you have multiple imams. So some imams pray eight rakat in Taraweeh and three four hours later before Fajr another imam comes and prays another eight or six rakat with the witter. Would it suffice if I pray with the first imam and go? The answer is no. Would it suffice if I only pray with the second imam as he's offering witter? The answer is no. Because the Prophet ï·º, he who prays with the imam until he concludes his night prayer, Allah would reward him as if he prayed the whole night. And this is meant by the imam who prays Isha, Taraweeh, Tahajjud and Witter. So if there are two imams, they're considered to be one. You have to pray with the first one, you have to pray with the second one. Therefore your husband must pray with the second imam and conclude his night prayer with him."
