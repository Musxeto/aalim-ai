  "title": "Not informing relatives about the death of a loved one | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his third and last question was about a family if one of their members died they are reluctant in telling other relatives about his death so they hush-hush things and they wash shroud of a prayer of janazah and they bury their deceased without informing others and this is awkward because most likely they have grudges in their hearts towards their relatives whom they do not want them to participate in the last thing that would ever happen to the deceased before his burial so it is hatred its envy you call it whatever you want to call it and this is wrong and this is sinful the deceased is in need for as many people asking Allah for him for forgiveness now than any other time and by you depriving him from this privilege you are doing him harm and you have ill intent against everyone else and you will be dealt with in the same fashion when you are in most need of Allah's mercy may Allah have mercy on us all"
