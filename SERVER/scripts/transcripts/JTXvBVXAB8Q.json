  "transcript": "[Music] is not mandatory so what is the explanation of ayah in the quran chapter number 73 ayah number 4 tajweed is a specific way the arabs pronounce certain letters when they are adjacent to other letters so this and so on tajweed by this sense is not mandatory it is something recommended it is preferable you reward it if you do it but you're not sinful if you skip it if you skip it so when i recite the fatiha [Music] totally wrong and any teacher of tajweed will say i'll flank you bad islamically is totally legit um i skipped the tanween no problem my recitation is correct my prayer is correct what is meant by this as mentioned in the tafsir by ali may allah be pleased with him the fourth hadith and the cousin of the prophet salam is to know when to stop and to pronounce letters accurately so you have to know when to stop and you do not stop at places that you're not supposed to stop because the meaning would differ so in the quran the meaning would differ if you say [Music] whoa what have you done to deny of the quran yeah it says woe to those who pray but the following ayah tells you what is meant by that those who are negligent over their prayers you did not recite this and you went for record so you have to know when to stop and when the meaning is related and you have to continue and you have to know how to pronounce the letters correctly so you don't come to the ayah [Music] vera you don't mix them up and say um it's identical what's the difference you did not make the distinction so as imam ali may allah be pleased with him said you have to know when to stop and you have to pronounce the letters correctly but this is not referring to tajweed and allah azza knows best you"
