  "transcript": "he says that in hasanul muslim there is a recommendation to recite the route the salutation to the prophet has done 10 times is it sufficient to say allahumma salli ala muhammad or should i say aloha ma salli wa sallim ala nabina muhammad the full thing first of all the hadith you're referring to was authenticated by sheikh al albani in the beginning and the hadith goes by whoever offers salutation upon me 10 times in the morning and 10 times in the evening then he will attain my intercession the Prophet says asanam later on in his life Shahar al body may Allah have mercy on his soul revised if his authentication of the hadith and came up with the conclusion that the hadith was not authentic and this shows you that he is a scholar other people would have shrugged their shoulders and moved on so what I've already said it's authentic I cannot go and retract what I've said this is shameful for me in front of everybody else everywhere everyone else but not jihad albani because he as we presume in him and Allah has he boo-hoo Azza WA JAL that he was one of the great scholars of Islam he retracted his authentication and said no the hadith is weak so my advice to you is not to say it anymore at these specific times ten times in the morning ten times in the evening but you can offer salutation to the Prophet al Assad Salam as many as you wish throughout the day and night so whenever you hear his name sallallahu wasallam you offer salutation and this is why we loosen the two aljahmeir are the most happy and lucky people because every time we study the sooner we mention his name sallallahu wasallam we offer this salutation"
