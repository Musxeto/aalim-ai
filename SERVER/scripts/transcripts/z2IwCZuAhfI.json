  "transcript": "from Bangladesh say a person asks a Sheikh about doing a certain action and the Sheikh advises him to avoid it but the Sheikh doesn't say that it's Haram so if this person still does it with the excuse that the Sheikh didn't say it's Haram so I'm going to do it would that person be sinful yes he would be sinful because if he took the initiative to ask the Sheikh about this action and the Sheik said you must avoid it and he did not ask the question again to the Sheikh by avoiding it is it haram or not and he just simply did it he is sinful without any doubt"
