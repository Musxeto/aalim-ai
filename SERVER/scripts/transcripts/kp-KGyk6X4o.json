  "transcript": "Adam from Kuwait. Adam. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. My question is, how to enjoy good and forbid evil when we always see people doing haram stuff like isbal and smoking? And if I see someone doing something haram far away from me, do I need to go out of my way to tell them? The answer is no. It is not possible or logical to be the moral police when everybody around you is either clean-shaven or doing isbal in their clothes below the ankle or smoking or listening to music or not praying in the masjid. I can't just be holding a stick and going to people trying to order them to do righteousness and virtue and forbidden evil and vice. This is not practical. What I can do is to do my level best. So if the situation allows me to do this, I can break the ice by communicating, maybe setting my priorities, because each and every individual may have a dozen of mistakes and errors according to sharia. So is it possible to just meet someone and say, oh akhi, you have this and this and this and this and this and this. You have to rectify. I'll write you a report and send it to you by email. This is not possible. Do whatever is possible to do, bearing in mind the consequences of your actions. And I've said this so many times. In Islam, it counts what the consequences of our actions are. It counts in the sense that if it's going to lead to more harm or it's going to repel people from Islam and sunnah, refrain. But if it's going to have an impact and it would help, then you should proceed. So you always weigh the pros and cons before you speak and before you act. And Allah knows best."
