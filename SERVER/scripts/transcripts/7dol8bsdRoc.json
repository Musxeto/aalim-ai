  "title": "Is repentance really sufficient if I have wronged & backbitten others? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "suffer from the us um i wanted to ask if somebody within their neurons or their past had wronged others verbally but they changed and they now know it's a major sin that they've done and they regret it and they've mended with many people and made a lot of repentance but some are left as they extremely aren't the most forgiving or might cause problems but it might be good as well to tell and some ignored it the person has made many draws for them in repentance for this but still feels despair and doubts the ruling on repenting and doing good deeds as it seems like it contradicts the hadith of no dirham no dinar and they see videos and reminders of the specific sin and then it makes them isolate and feel depressed and then they go into the cycle of doing the same thing again but it makes it worse is topa really it and is doing that specific that's what you gave and many other scholars gave really it and is there any evidence for it because they're doubting it so on what basis are they doubting it and in what account a person comes and just walk out of thin air and say is that it on what ground are you challenging it um well the person kind of feels like it contradicts the hadith because it says to go or like alerts for that person to go apologize and the that's what says to not apologize to that person because it might make it worse so it seems like they're so you you're doing exactly like someone says that lying is prohibited in islam and if a murderer knocks on my door barging in asking about a specific individual who's hiding under the bed or in a closet scared for his life and he's asking is this individual in the house and you say well i can't lie i have to say yeah he is under the bed and he goes and kills him is that a legit a logical thing because it goes under the main guidelines not to lie yes or no no it's not a logical thing okay likewise this assumption that individual has that we have to go and tell people about the things that we've wronged them and this is so that we would not face the problem of dirham and dinar on the day of judgment and that they will take from our good deeds and they'll throw their bad deeds on us and then we'll be throwing hellfire is not applicable in every single case because this is general when there is a greater evil that may be a consequence to telling people about your past and the things that you've wronged them with islam says no refrain if telling people that listen a couple of years ago i stole from your store money i stole ten dollars and this means that they're going to report me to the police and they'll incarcerate me and probably throw me in jail for a couple of years nobody in his sound mind would say no you have to do this no for such a trivial amount the evil that is resulting from coming up front and and saying the truth is far greater than what ever is uh anticipated from the reward therefore we have to weigh the pros and cons and we have to to commit or to do the lesser evil of the two if i know that this individual if i tell him about the things i said about him or the wrong things i did about him in the past he would come and torture me or it would cause a greater fitna or maybe severing kinship or maybe causing me to go into jail or causing a great deal of trouble to others no islam tells you you don't have to do this and allah knows best you"
