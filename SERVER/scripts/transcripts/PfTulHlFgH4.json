  "transcript": "[Music] to be shared was first brought by ibn tamiya so they demand scholars and quotations before abnetemia who said it is shared called upper so can you please provide some scholars who predate even tamiya who said that okay abdullah from pakistan says some people from the people of innovation say that istirata which is a major shirk when done other than allah was originated by ibn taymiyyah now they are the people of innovation the people who follow their desires and whims the people who do istighta who worship the graves who consider tijani and jilani the organizers and the administrators of the universe who think that the awliya control the universe so when they come with a blatant lie accusing one of the great imams of tawhid such as ebentaymia whose books are everywhere and his publications are so many talking about these issues of shirk and kufur and rectifying what they say and refuting it and correcting the akita of people when such people of innovation say such blatant lies who in his right mind would even look at it let alone refute it or uh answer it if you're walking and a dog barks at you would it be logical to fall on your hands and knees and bark back definitely not you just walk away it's a dog so it's a waste of time when we have the quran when we have the authentic sunnah when we have the three favorite generations to explain to us the quran and the sunnah when we have the great scholars of islam like evan tamiya ibn and the likes explaining and elaborating about these things and then we leave all of that and listen to any tom dick or harry barking in the middle of the night we should really at least be bigger than that you"
