  "transcript": "Kainat from Pakistan. Sheikh, what is the ruling about loving Islam and is it okay to look at the person you love and think about him or not? What is the ruling on what? Love in Islam. What do you mean by love? Love your father, love your mother, love your what? Loving someone means a boy or a girl. Halal love, not haram love. How can love be halal if someone is not muharram? Loving your husband is very permissible and recommended. So Sheikh, I have second question, can I ask? No, you have to ask the first question. What kind of love are we talking about? Haram relationship? Loving someone? No, halal. It means you love somebody but you are not willing to tell him or her. This is something in your heart which only Allah knows about and no one knows about it. This is a feeling, feelings of love, feelings of hate, feeling of resentment. As long as you don't show it to anyone else, this is in your heart. Allah will not hold you accountable unless these feelings are translated into actions. So if someone loves another person from the opposite gender, a man loves a woman but he does not freely mix, he does not socialize, he does not text, he does not make a pass, he does not look at her, he tries to avoid where she is but still he has feelings for her. He's not sinful for that and Allah knows best. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
