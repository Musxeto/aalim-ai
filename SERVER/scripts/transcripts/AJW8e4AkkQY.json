  "transcript": "so my question is um what's the ruling i'm wearing gladison dress traditional graduation system right yes okay so the ceremony that many universities throw at the end of the year for those who have completed a degree and they're about to graduate and they make them wear this black rope and this hat or cap that is square this is an islamic but if it is a ceremony it has no religious background i don't know if they have any christian uh background to it if it's just a ceremony and there is no free mixing and this is extremely important for a sister to go and wear this rope and this cap and come in on the theater in front of everybody and most likely shake hands with the dean and exchanges kisses with the teachers and hugging the students what are you doing it's graduation day no this is totally inappropriate and haram but if it's in on all women a university totally segregated and they're doing this i see no problem in that insha allah"
