  "title": "Does a woman have to undo her hair when doing Ghusl in the case of Janabah",
  "transcript": "so Latifah's question is what is the difference \nbetween removing major ritual impurity from menses   and other forms of hustle such as \num removing major ritual impurity   due to sexual intercourse or just cleaning because \nshe remembers someone saying something about   unbraiding untying or breaking the braids of the \nhair when it's for menses the answer is no it's   the same thing. You don't have to untie your \nbraids undo your braids for Ghusl either one   some schools of thought made this um instruction \nsaying that Ghusl for menses comes once a month   while Ghusl for sexual intercourse for spouse may \nhappen every day so that there is a hardship but   the most authentic opinion it's, all the same, \nyou don't need to untie or undo your braids."
