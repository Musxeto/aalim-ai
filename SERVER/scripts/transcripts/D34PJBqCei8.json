  "title": "ðŸ†• Asking for highest level of Jannah a transgression in Dua? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is if we make dua to Allah like grant me the highest place in Paradise or grant me the best location in Janatul Firdaus Is it transgression because the Prophets and the Messengers and the Companions of the Prophet are more deserving to be in the highest positions in the Paradise than us? So are we allowed to make such dua? The transgression would be if you ask Allah Azza Wa Jal to grant you Al-Wasila Because we know that only one person, one individual would be granted this high level and we know that it is the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam But to ask Allah for the highest levels in Jannah, this is not an exclusivity, this is a ranking that you and I could attain with the grace of Allah This is why the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said in an authentic Hadith Whenever you ask Allah Azza Wa Jal, ask Allah for the Firdaus for it is the highest level in Jannah and it's in the middle of the Jannah And this, the ceiling of it is the throne of Allah Azza Wa Jal So such a request does not mean that I would be in the same level of Prophet Muhammad and his Companions Yet it's a transgression, no there's no transgression in this This is what the Prophet ordered us Alayhis Salatu Wassalam to aspire and to ask Allah for and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best"
