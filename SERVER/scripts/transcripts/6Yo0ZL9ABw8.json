  "transcript": "consider subscribing from bangladesh check my question is um a popular shake as a youtube channel and all right and the youtube channel has 1.1 million subscribers you know it's huge so he uploads some videos like about that about after life about many things like the seat of muhammad s his video he upload or he say about government about toronto government which are ruled by man-made law so he said that it is totally prohibited to live in those country who uh which are ruled by man-made law so can i watch uh his video which are created by his voice where does where does this this guy live i don't mean in in i think in saudi or in qatar okay i'll answer you inshallah yasin talks about someone i don't know and i don't want to know and this guy has many followers he's famous he's got one point something on youtube million followers and he uploads beneficial videos sometimes about the seerah about the life of the prophet islam about the companions about the day of judgment about the hereafters many good things but at the same time he speaks ill about muslim rulers so can we watch and learn from this channel the answer is no if you have food or drinks and someone puts poison in it it tastes good and it might be good but it has poison in it such people who speak ill publicly about muslim rulers are from the hawari okay this is very wide and broad simply what's their objective is it to fix things or to make things worse look at the consequences look at what will happen look at what had happened when people came and started talking ill about muslim rulers they're not infallible they're human beings they might be corrupt they might be the worst of people but to have a tyrant ruler is better than to be without any ruler for one day to have a tyrant ruler for 70 years is better than to be without a ruler for one day this is what the salaf used to say because the unity of the ummah comes first yes he may use man-made laws this is a big problem and it's an issue of dispute whether it's related to conviction or not if he believes that the quran and the sunnah are the ultimate and they must be followed nothing comes close to them and yet he still put puts man-made laws this is a very major sin but we don't take him out of the hold of islam when you come publicly and start tarnishing his reputation discrediting him humiliating him insulting him what would this cause in the hearts of laymen normal people uprising protest chaos killing widespread violence and we see this in so-called democratic muslim countries whenever a government is overthrown or they change powers and when the rao happens between the parliament and the government and the opposition and look what's happening to that country it's being devastated it's being ruined and the enemies of islam are happy they're having a blast the best time of their lives many arab countries the people used to travel they used to go to schools they used to eat drink and live yes there was oppression there was a great deal of injustice but they used to live a normal life after these uprisings and such people tarnishing their reputation on youtube and causing people to revolt and to rebel what happened now the people have passports that have no value no country accepts them for a visit they don't have food on their tables they don't have a roof on their heads they're scattered in refugee camps and they're swimming and sailing across the mediterranean risking their lives and their children's lives for a decent life ten years ago they had that decent life so we look at the bigger picture not about what's right and what's wrong in your perspective rather what has to be done after referring to real scholars of islam not to such youtubers or celebrities on social media who know nothing the amount of followers does not mean a thing you could be someone followed by 60 million does this make you even a respected human being no like most celebrities in the west disbelievers nude immoral and they have done everything in the book that's against morality and religion how many followers do we have in the millions does it change anything no there's still the scum of the earth so don't look at the number of the followers look about look at what a person preaches is it in accordance with the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the favorite three generations the the sahaba the tabernacle if yes then go ahead and learn from such a person you"
