  "title": "If the Imam comes up from Sujood, can I continue to finish my Dua? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Uh, Dayan from the Emirates. Uh, Sheikh, my question was regarding, uh, \nsee if I'm praying with the Imam, and let's say he goes up from the Sujood, is it okay \nfor me to continue finishing the Dua that I started? Or is it not? The Prophet ﷺ, in the hadith, known as the one, \nin the hadith where the companions differed from their prayer than his \nprayer, the Prophet said, Innama ju'ilal imamu liyu'tammabih. \nThe Imam was made to be followed. So when he bows, you bow immediately. When \nhe rises, you rise. When he prostrates, you prostrate. When he sits, you sit. This, the \nscholars, uh, understood from this hadith that we have to follow the Imam step by step and \nnot delay at all. And the companions explained this. And they said, we did not move until \nthe Prophet ﷺ reached the following pillar. So in the standing position, after rising \nfrom rukoor, the Prophet would say, Allahu Akbar and goes for Sujood. The companions say, \nwe did not bend our backs until the forehead of the Prophet ﷺ reached the ground. Only \nthen we would move. Unlike what the people are doing today, when they race with their \nImam, sometimes the Imam says, Allahu Akbar, and all what you hear is banging on their, \ntheir knees on the ground. And the Imam is still standing in their, in the Sujood position. \nThis is not permissible, and the prayer is invalid if they do this deliberately and raise \nthe Imam and reach the pillar before him. So, it is not permissible for you to prolong \nyour Sujood for Dua when the Imam has raised his head and likewise in all pillars except \nat the end. So if the Imam offers Salam, the prayer is inconcluded. You can prolong your \nDua before the Salam for like 5, 10, 15 seconds without any further delay and then offer the \nSalam. This is the only position , and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
