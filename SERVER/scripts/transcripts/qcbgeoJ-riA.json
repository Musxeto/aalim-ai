  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK um in different countries there are \ndifferent norms for clothing and for   example in Nigeria they wear colorful clothing \nand in Saudi Arabia they were simple and plain   clothing I was wondering if it's a okay as a \nMuslim sister to wear clothing with patterns   keep in mind this is not Embroidery For example \nzigzags polka dots or tie-dye on my jacket dress   Etc this is what normal streetwear in the UK \nis like for people like me and others living   here especially the youth is it okay to \nwear these patterns as long as they're   not vibrant and very attractive colors \nrather they are mute and simple colors dress code is related to both \nIslamic traditions and to the culture   so Islamic ettiquete dictates \nthat your dress code must not be   tight showing your curves and bone structure \nmust not be see-through must not be imitating   men or imitating women and must not be \nattractive in themselves drawing attention   so one must not wear something that is really \nweird that would make him or her stand in a crowd   if these are fulfilled then we go to \nthe norm of a society and a community   so if you are in a country such as Nigeria \nwhere the people are used to wearing such colors   where if she were to wear it in Saudi Arabia \nor in Qatar for example that would not be   accepted because it would be too attractive \nan eye attraction and distracting the people   in this case this is according to the culture so \nyou have to go to the real righteous practicing   imams in the UK and say to them is what I'm \nwearing acceptable in the community or not   so normal color colors that are not um \neye-catching and not attractive it wouldn't   make you stand in a crowd everybody's wearing it \namong the Muslims not that you're the only Muslim   who's wearing it and everybody else may be tempted \nto look and investigate what's behind the curtains   if this is the case and they say it's normal \nthen it's normal without any problem inshallah and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
