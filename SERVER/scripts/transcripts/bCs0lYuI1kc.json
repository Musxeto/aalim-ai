  "title": "Do we send salutations to the Prophetï·º upon hearing the athaan or iqamah | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now I think we will conclude with this last last question we have like three minutes Shahab says do we have to send blessing that is salutation to the Prophet our son when we hear his name in the van Annie Palmer the short answer is no the Prophet is awesome whenever his name is mentioned in a shadow and the mohammed ur rasoolallah you do not say allah humma salli wa sallim ala muhammad because neither the Prophet did it so some know the Companions know that that's happening and beside if we say that it's an obligatory then the more other than himself when he's calling the Adhan he has to stop and pause for it and this is not true and it is not from the sunnah and hence one should refrain from doing this yes we offer salutation to the Prophet as Salam 24/7 but not with such specific earth car because the F car is mandated by Allah so John and given to us by the Prophet is awesome we cannot reinvent the wheel so if someone sneezes and says I'll help doodler a llama salli wa sallim ala muhammad say dope what are you doing he said I'm offering salutation to the Prophet what's wrong in that said he the Prophet taught us to say alhamdulillah full stop adding anything else would be an innovation is not permissible"
