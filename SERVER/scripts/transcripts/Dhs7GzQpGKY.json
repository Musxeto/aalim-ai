  "transcript": "okay fidan from Turkey uh so if someone like oversleeps and they have to pray as soon as um right right but how much time are they allowed to kind of spend can they lay down like for 30 seconds and then get up or drink water first or use the bathroom before they start the prayer or like alternatively if um like someone's period starts when the prayer is due so they have to make it up after the after they take also after Administration could they like spend the time to wash their hair as well after their period is gone or do they have to be as fast as they can to down to their second see the issue of Performing prayer after uplifting a major impurity this is not to be done ASAP in the sense that no you just have a full bath and go and pray as long as the time of prayer is extended you have no problem let's assume that a woman a woman saw her Purity at nine o'clock P.M Russia ends at 11 30. so from 9 to 11 30 she could do whatever she wants she can even postpone her whistle until 11 o'clock it's not that no you have to do it now there's nothing that would support this but if Russia is about to run out of time so she saw her Purity at 11 20 or 11 10. in this case there is very little time we say to her yes do your mandatory Russell without shampooing without taking any extra care of your Hair Etc and do offer Eurasia and then you can come back and do whatever you want likewise when a person wakes up and finds out that he missed Fajr so I set the alarm clock to five o'clock and I woke up at seven and the sun was already up in the sky do I have to immediately go to the toilet and answer the call of nature make golden come back or can I have a sip of water or can I uh um do something normal that people do in their home like brush my teeth and then pray the answer is yes such a delay is not considered to be something that would hamper making up your prayer and Allah knows uh uh best"
