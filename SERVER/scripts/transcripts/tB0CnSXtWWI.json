  "transcript": "Maham from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. My question is that there are skin care products that it is written on them that they brighten the skin but I don't know if like it is by like by removing the impurities from the skin or like by changing the color of the skin which is not permissible so is it permissible to buy those products if you don't know how would I know yeah you need to tell me does it change the color of the skin yes or no oh I don't know they are it is just written on like on them that they like enhance the skin color but I'm confused about that if you don't know I cannot answer you if a product softens the skin gives it a bright look it's healthy it's medically safe no problem what the problem is that if you apply it on someone who is dark skin he became becomes white as in the case of Michael Jackson for example now this is a problem because now you're changing the creation of Allah azza wa jal whether surgically or through applying chemicals that would alter the change of Allah permanently or for a very very long time this becomes haram applying makeup foundation powdering whatever they apply this is temporary for half an hour one hour five hours and it's gone this is permissible and there's no change of creation of Allah's creation through that but applying chemicals that would give your you a different skin tone for six months or the likes this is what is not permissible you"
