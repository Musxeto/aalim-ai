  "transcript": "brahim says during this time of pandemic we sanitize our hands very often which contains alcohol in it so is it allowed to read the Koran and offer Salah after sin aside sanitizing our hands with alcohol-based sanitizers alcohol is not neji's and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars it is not physically impure which means that if I have it on my clothes or on my body this means I have to wash it before prayer therefore you can use sanitizers and hold the most half not only that you can also pray while having traces of sanitizers on your hand or putting alcohol-based perfumes on your body and clothes there's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah"
