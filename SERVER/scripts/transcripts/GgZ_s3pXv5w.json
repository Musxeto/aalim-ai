  "transcript": "marish says must I know the reward of an act before doing it to get rewarded the answer's no I'll give you an example the Prophet said that is Salah to some whoever prays Fajar in congregation and remains where he had prayed and making vicar remembering allah azza wajal or reciting the Quran until the Sun rises then he prays two rakahs Allah would reward him with umrah and hajj complete complete complete now if I do this because I love Allah I prayed for in the Masjid I remained reciting the Quran memorizing revising until it was sunrise time ten minutes afterwards I prayed and offered to records of ashrak but I did not know the reward will I or won't I be rewarded as definitely you will be rewarded it is sufficient for you to know that this is a form of worship and that Allah Allah loves it that you will get the full reward whether you know the reward or not this is not important"
