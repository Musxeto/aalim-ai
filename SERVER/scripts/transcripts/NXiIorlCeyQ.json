  "transcript": "if if you guys ever visit me home inshallah and you speak loudly like this unfortunately I'm going to kick you out this is the house of Allah it should be respected we have to have manners with with Allah so yes I know it's a an eventful uh en joyful event but we have to have manners we're Muslims so excuse me for saying this I don't know you're not I know you're not going to come to my home but just in case we'd like to welcome everyone we know there's a lot of people so forgive us we're trying to accommodate as many people as we can but we're going to get this program going inshallah momentarily actually we'll get it going right now because the sh has already started um today we have shim and um was born in Al in Saudi Arabia right for the people who don't know for the people alhamdulillah and then I'll skip the introduction we all got to know the brother Alim from his and benefited from his knowledge in Islam and Family Matters from his various uh appearances in television and radio today inshallah he's visiting with us and we're going to benefit and uh from his knowledge in a topic of protecting the Islamic family in the time of especially right here in the west so without further Ado please indeed this is one of the best conferences I've been to they've giving me this chair that can go right and left I'm not I'm not used to this so I can do this and you know it's it's fun and next time inshallah it's remote control that would be even better so the topic is quite generic in the sense that in the sense that how to protect our families at times of FNA and this topic this the title needs to be broken down into at least eight lectures seriously it is so important but we don't seem to find the right weight for it therefore first of all FNA the word has been mentioned in the Quran and in the Sunnah and the scholars have talked about it for so many times throughout time what is f and the prophet says seek refuge in Allah from F from trials and tribulations that is both visible and hidden so what is fitna fitna is trial testing tribulation the word is often used to describe tests in which something disliked is eliminated we try to get out of it later it was also often used in the sense of and this is used in the Quran and Sunnah sin kuur sh f means all these words fighting burning when you TOR torture someone through burning this is f as in F here means they burnt them in trenches and removing and and diverting all of this is FNA so FNA has a very broad meaning sh and kufur is FNA and the prophet Alat asked us to seek refuge in Allah from FNA in general what is the greatest FNA on Earth women Cit huh theal the Antichrist the impostor theal the prophet said Allah did not place a FNA greater than the deal and we know a lot about him and this is why we seek refuge in Allah at the end of Salat from four things among them is the also the prophet told us about the fitna in our Graves the tribulation and the the torment and the questioning in the grave each and every one of you will be asked in his grave three questions what who's your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you easy to answer correct no it's not because you will not be able to answer it unless you lived upon it what you live upon you're going to die upon and you're going to be successful or a big failure depending on how you lived in this life also there is the fitna of Hellfire and the torment and hellfire the fitna of wealth and poverty the FNA of dun and death all of these the prophet often sought refuge in these are FNA we were to talk about it it would be is time maybe F time and we would not have concluded among the fan that the prophet had warned us from the FNA of women and this is for men of course and why do we have FNA of women if you have a the most handsome man walking through 50 women only one or two women would look the others would could care less but if you have a knockout bombshell walking through 50 men 49 men would look the other one has short Vision can't see this is human nature Subhan Allah this is how Allah created this and this is why the prophet warned us from the FNA of women this is why women are obliged to wear hijab men are not who'd look at them nobody's interested in them but women subh all you put a goat next to you in your car and put on the goat you know the beautiful eyes of the goat everybody's going to honk you and try to throw a number and do something to draw the attention thinking that it's a sheep so women are FNA and wealth is FNA the prophet saidat every um has a FNA and the FNA of my um is my money what makes people accept bribe and consume Haram what makes people get houses and mortgages not one not two not five and they make a business out of it and they become rich knowing that they're dealing in riba yeah yeah I heard the Sheikh in Zimbabwe say it's okay so it's I know where's Zimbabwe I don't know somewhere in Alaska so it doesn't matter when you once you want something to justify your Haram you'll find a proper sheh or so-called Sheikh who would give you a fatwa but would this help you in the F of Al in your grave no so these are different fitan and the wives the spouses the husbands and the children are FNA Allah says and know that you your uh uh properties and your children are but a trial fitna I have five kids Subhan Allah then what one of them will take me to Jenna he's righteous he's practicing he's memorizing the Quran he's a and one of them would take me to hell he does drugs and he just came out of the closet I don't know why I was keeping him in the closet so long but he just came out and now he's disgrace disgrace to me and I don't know what to do so it's a fitness it's a trial now these fan are so many to speak about them would take us a real long time but we have to learn them it's not sufficient to live and be Blinded By the Light unable to see what's surrounding us like an ostrich putting our head in the sand and claiming all good there is no harm outside I can't see anything of course your head is in the earth you can't see what's outside because you chose to run away from your problems instead of facing them so these fitan the topic is how to protect our families from fitna which one are we talking about now the greatest fitna is to turn your back to Islam this is the greatest fitna that nobody pays attention to oh all masjids all Islamic centers she talk about the FNA of uh marriage second wife wives clap yeah keep up the good work the man wants to marry a second wife or a third or fourth wife that's a good topic oh she talk about the FNA of pornography again the wives are clapping yes that's good our husbands are addicted to it she talk about this talk about that these are only the tip of the iceberg nobody's looking at the the real problem you're just trying to solve symptoms the guy has headache what what is it called Dil ail what what you know I whatever Tylenol give him two two tablets that the headache is gone 5 hours 6 hours later it comes back again give him another couple of tablets keep on doing it for a whole week am I helping I'm s solving the symptoms not the real illness he might have cancer he might have a big problem we Muslims only look at the symptom from outside we're good I have a long beard you can't blame me I have a short tho I missed my miswak because my teeth are not well I can't use it but on the surface I'm a good practicing Muslim what is inside you don't know this is what needs to be fixed and this is what the Muslims are unaware of they tend to look for quantity not quality take your child to Sunday school memorize the Quran do this do that what's inside it's Hollow it's empty and this is why when the right time comes he comes out running from the closet he just wants to run oh I'm going to UNI in a different state 6 hours away I don't want to know you I don't want to see you I don't want to talk to you anymore I've spent 18 years raising you you you you you punk yes yeah but okay I'm I'm a different person now this is what we should be addressing how to protect our families from fitna the greatest FNA is to turn your back to Shar Allah says in the Quran so let those beware who this sent from his order lest FNA strike them or a painful punishment the fitna comes when you go against the order of the Prophet Alat wasam when you disobey him when you choose another way of life other than his you are in the midst of FNA you can't see it all is good like the ostrich all is fine you cannot see it because you're blind de so tell me has Allah created a human being on Earth ever without testing them nope not a single person yet Allah's testing varies so Allah May test Ellen musk with billions everybody says oh Ya Allah test me test me and may test others with poverty he may test bodybuilders with health and strength and he may test others with illness he may test us with safety and security and benefits and beautiful weather of course not here elsewhere but other people have wars they have tornadoes they have floodings they have earthquakes may Allah protect us all so the tests are ongoing but we do not see it or we see it but we're negligent of it now when we know that everyone of us is being tested I'm being tested my wife my children my neighbors then we come to the reason of the test why is Allah testing us does Allah want money Subhan Allah Allah Asel gives Every Soul on Earth what it needs and more Allah doesn't need you Allah owns everything in this universe and he gives without account so what does he want of us Allah wants to test us so that our actions would determine whether you're going to go to hell for eternity or you going to go to paradise and for eternity may Allah make me and you among those who go to for eternity this is what we live and die for how long are you going to live another 50 years 60 years then what it's death so what's the end result what will go with you in your grave your CV and resume your bank account your properties your certificates and your degrees nothing would go with you except your good deeds and bad so start filling up your grave one of the brothers says I've started filling my Graves like 5 10 years ago it's it already has a split unit and a small fridge and lights and all what it needs is electricity I've been doing good deeds building orphanages and trying to do good deeds pray night prayer fast Mondays and Thursdays and stay away from Haram so I know what awaits me in my grave and I'm hopeful and grateful to Allah so I know what do you know about your grave what do you have if the angel of death comes to you at the moment what are you going to say um can I have like couple of hours maybe in the weekend if we can meet yeah I have so many things to clear clear it from now now the test is there for you and your families listen to what the prophet saysat each of you is a shepherd and each of you is a count able for his flock so the Father the husband is responsible for his wife and children the wife is responsible for her house and and for her children the ruler is responsible for his everyone is accountable they're going to be asked you're going to be asked don't look right and left don't look at my father or I my mom or my uncle look at yourself in the mirror and point at yourself you are going to be asked what are your what is your response going to be your capital in this life is your religion in every business what's your capital a million dollars okay try to preserve it and try to invest it what is your capital in life it's your religion this is your Capital if you lose it you're a loser and your investment is gone down the drain this is why the Prophet used to always make Dua s Alam by saying oh Allah set right for me my religious commitment which is the Safeguard of my Affairs now going to the topic again we don't have enough time so I'm going to wrap it up as quick as possible how do we protect our families at times of fitna number one prevention is the best cure it's better than cure it's better than healing if you know someone has cold don't mix with them and say I'm going to take cold medicine no prevent yourself from meeting them from mixing with them correct so what is the prevention you have to prevent your family from mixing with the disbelievers and with the Sinners because if you fail to protect them from this they will inevitably be like them we've seen so many Muslims good Muslims coming to the West migrating to cfir countries and little by little their religion is diminishing is falling short and they're compromising their practice 10 years ago you was you were not like this 5 years ago you were not like this last year you were not like this what are you waiting for to hang a cross around your neck so you have to flee and run before it's too late the prophet saysat wasam I disavow every Muslim who resides among the disbeliever the mus I disavow and when a man comes to give the pledge of allegiance to the prophet Alat the prophet says to him I accept your Pledge of Allegiance on the basis that you will worship Allah alone establish prayer give zakat be sincere towards the Muslims and depart from the mushin leave them and don't live among them so what are we doing here she what do you want us to do migrate yes it is not permissible for you to live among the disbelievers unless the conditions are fulfilled number one you're able to practice your religion alhamdulillah we're able to practice our religion we give we pray five times in the Masjid nobody harasses us women wear the hijab seen women wearing the nikab and alhamdulillah we have Muslim uh outlets and restaurants everything is cool we can do that alhamdulillah with little restrictions you know the schools and uh some other aspects in Islam but generally speaking Yeah inshallah but you are the judge you can judge your own children and your own wife and your own husband if they are in danger or not among the conditions that you have enough knowledge that would prevent you from falling prey to the doubts and The Whispers the enemies of Islam throw in your heart why women marry one man and man men marry four this is not fair why the inheritance is half of the man this is not fair this and that then you get Whispers of creeping into their heads feminist ideas no you and I are equal this is prevailing among the women now the women come and said no you and I are equal so the husband says what do you want me to do next year I should conceive and what do you mean we're equal this is not true there's no equality in Islam between men and women sh Islam is the religion of equality there is no equality in Islam between men and women there is fairness they have their role you have your role in front of Allah they're equal on the day of judgment in reward and in sin but in this D huh Allah says in the Quran men are not like or male is not like a female there are biological differences and this is not the time to go through these things so if if you have knowledge that would ward off doubts if you have religious commitment that word offs would word off uh lusts and desires it would protect you because you have fear of Allah why don't you why aren't you tempted well I'm a family man if you push me too far I just might no I have de I'm not a family man I have religion that protects me okay that's good thirdly that being here is for a legitimate reason I'm here to study I'm here seeking medication and and and medical treatment I'm here to do business I'm here to do something that I can't do in the Muslim world or I running away for my life I'm being prosecuted and blah blah blah okay this is a legitimate reason so this is the best remedy to protect your family from fan FNA here is way far greater than the FNA in the Muslim world we don't have FNA in the Muslim world like hell we don't we have a lot but compared to what you guys are having it's peanuts it's nothing the huge fitan here you can't even reprimand your child can you the prophet says order them to pray when they're seven and beat them when they're 10 if they don't pray can you do do that yes or no 911 how can I help you Dad is Bea me upas 5 Seconds they're in front of your house your son is gone giving to a Christian uh uh family and you yourself either going to be in jail or deported Subhan Allah so what kind of more fitna would you like to have secondly in order to protect your family from fitan you must abide by the majority of the Muslims Choose Wisely a community that has no dispute among them no labeling of people don't follow she who comes and say oh she so and so he's trash Sheik so and so he's an innovator she so and so he is this one is this this one and he keeps on labeling left Frid Center all all he's he's he's he's this he's that okay who's left on The Arena yours sincerely I'm the best one you can ask don't ask anyone elsei such a person is not to be listened or learned from be with the community and try to have no beef with anyone not even mutton not even chicken try to be a a good brother and when someone wants to argue with you just give them a smile and say you're right and move this is how you protect your family by not engaging inside battles and distracting yourself and your family from going to among the things that would protect your family is to stren strengthen your Iman how do I strengthen my IM in Canada go to the gym no no no that's wrong aan aan is my sister no well how to strengthen your Iman in Canada by doing good deeds you have to audit yourself I'm not going to come to you each and every one of you say how did you do this F okay what about you how is the fasting Mondays and Thursdays what about you night prayer nobody's going to audit you it's between you and Allah you want to fix yourself audit yourself how am I with Allah sit and reflect on yourself five minutes a day is it that long oh sh I have Netflix I don't have time just always watching things and listening to music no sit 5 minutes in front of the mirror like a crazy dude and just look at yourself okay I didn't know I was that ugly no besides the point of being ugly or handsome what have I done am I getting closer to Allah or am I getting further away from Allah what are my good deeds that I'm filling up do I have a split unit in my grave well I don't even think there's an anir a fan not even one of my fans so you have to focus on doing good deeds to strengthen your Iman how much sins do you have in your daily routine how many songs how many movies how many backbiting people how many slandering how many cheating and bribing and lying and missing Salat so many many sins so what do I have to show up for before I die this elevates your Iman rocket High and the best thing that protects your family and yourself from fan nowadays is Sal Allah says in the Quran and establish prayer indeed prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoings if you pray on time five times a day you are 100 times better than someone who prays on and off because you have something inside you your subconscious is always telling you this is Haram you love Allah you pray five times you make you make how dare you do this thing even if you're tempted to listen to some Haram music all music is Haram to to watch something movies or soap opras or something you remember that Allah is watching you Allah is listening to what you're listening to do I love Allah I can't do this so your Salat would protect you from this doing good deeds is a protection from Haram from fan even from fan listen to this beautiful Hadith the prophet saysat hasten to do good deeds he's telling us to do what good deeds not to delay it hasten now so someone comes and says okay we need money to build a Masjid like this wah this is one of the greatest Investments you can do in your life a community center to help people pray to help women go to segregated gym men to go to segregated gym to have a facility that serves the community W this is one of the best investments you can do so the prophet says hasten to do good deeds why he says before there come tribulations F like pieces of Dark Night when a man will be a believer in the morning and a cafer by evening or he will be a believer in the evening and when he wakes up in the morning he's a full-fledged cafir selling his religious commitment for worldly gain how many of the Muslims now would sell their religious commitment for worldly gain how much what is your price oh have no price I'm a Muslim would you take like $100,000 and Skip Salah really whoa no no no I will only escape fajer this much I only Escape fjer Subhan Allah we are easy to sell our religion we are easy to compromise our religion for some of the money like the Hadith says as for leaving monat abandoning sins this elevates your but the time is not at all in our favor because talking about evil things and sins would take us forever so all what we care about is to protect our family from sins and among the top sins other than leaving Salat and the and the likes is free mixing when we have free mixing in schools public schools when I put fuel next to the fire and pray Ya Allah it does not it it does not ignite is it possible it is not it's human nature so preserve your kids your children and put them in Islamic schools segregated schools put them away from the opposite gender if you want to save them in uni men have no excuse because they can't there's there are no no segregated schools for men and they're The Bread Winners so they have to go to universities so they have to abide by the Islamic Shar lowering their gaze not mixing but they have to mix but don't mix don't flirt don't socialize keep your distance girls on the other hand they're not obliged to go to UNI they can do online they could do a lot of things or look for segregated universities for women I will not put my daughter in public school where would they go to swimming pools together for a physical education class or they would wrestle or would wear inappropriate clothes and I say it's the country she and I trust my my daughter trust my daughter my foot so no you have to draw the line if you want to save your daughters lowering the Gaze people now don't lower the Gaze they watch movies they watch uh YouTube clips they watch everything lowering the Gaze is something of the past yeah she but if you don't lower your gaze Shan step by step will drag you into pornography and ask me about counseling sessions I have got a lot of girls and boys coming to me addicted to pornography you're a Muslim how could this be you don't believe that is when I'm watching is Allah watching with me or not so you okay with this no I'm not Sheik if I were to watch with you are you okay with this oh you you'll beat the heck out of me I know you she you're rude and Savage and okay enough with the insults so you don't want me to watch with you how dare you Allah is watching and listening and you're fine with it so this leads to this and this leads to that and little by little people would go downhill and this is how you prevent and protect your family from fittting among the protection that we should do is Dua a lot of Dua every single every single between and every time in the last third of the night in the last hour of the jum whenever it rains whenever we hear the rooster in the morning if we have one bird flu maybe doesn't allow us to do that but we have to choose when to make Dua and insist on Allah to protect us to protect our families to put us on the straight path and make us steadfast this is why every single Salat every single ra we say guide us to the straight path every single come on give me a break once a day no every single ra you must as a pillar to repeat this verse and this is why the prophet saidat in theith I mentioned in the beginning seek Refuge with Allah from trials both hidden and visible so the prophet is telling you ordering you make Dua say always say this how much time do you have huh 1015 minutes wrap things up quickly among the ways that you protect your family is keep them away from Bad Company and the prophet said this clearly a man will follow the way of his close friend so let one of you look at who he takes as a close friend this is visible to us if you associate yourself with someone who loves sports all you talk about is sports if you associate yourself with someone who's a fanatic with cars all what you talk about is double cam shaft and headers and and blowers and supercharges and and the likes you associate yourself with someone who loves property mashallah you become a real estate agent lots of the people once they get in the circle of practicing Muslims without them feeling it when they buy a cheeseburger from the shop and the guy hands them the cheeseburger they and the guy said say what oh thank you thank you it becomes something of a habit they pick up words and phrases this is what happens when you associate yourself with Bad Company If you associate with Bad Company If you're driving and you see a an a Wheeler almost crashing you and killing you do you say or you say WTF lol and you text it this this is what's happening the more you are with Bad Company the more you are like them so keep your family away know who your kids are associated with know who your wife hangs out with and the worst of Bad Company is your dumb phones or what we call smartphones social media Instagram Twitter face H uh and Facebook and and the likes all of these will take make you places you don't want to be these are the sources of FNA they brainwash you they make you they mold you into what you read and see and watch so you have to save yourself by eliminating these things among the things that will protect you learning Islamic knowledge this is something that will definitely be your protection everyone has a computer and every computer we've installed an antivirus so usually hackers and viruses could not come when you have Islamic knowledge of Quran of Sunnah of of of of of knowing Arabic it would be next to impossible for you to be affected by fan and you will be to an extent but you will soon wake up and you will soon come back and many many of our kids who we made them memorize the Quran and go to Sunday school and teach them Islam when they grew up and got married they went a little bit astray and this hurts us Big Time inevitably they came back alhamdulillah because they were raised on a solid platform so they might tilt a little bit but they come back again with the grace of Allah so learn your religion teach it to your kids and alhamdulillah you can do this in the comfort of your own home now I'm endorsing and advocating a program called dad Academy z a d Academy it's a 2-year course online and you learn seven Islamic subjects every semester and it's 100% free and one of the greatest Scholars teach in there she Muhammad Salah for example Dr Muhammad Salah you know Dr Muhammad Salah from Huda TV and myself and other reputable uh uh brothers who teach you sound knowledge what is the umbrella of zad Academy that we could trust that would have the authentic knowledge what is the most trusted website Islamic website on Earth Islam qa. info no one has a question and he does not go to this website Islam q& a.info is the mother and the umbrella of zad Academy you can learn your knowledge and your children can learn it it's very easy it's hasslefree so this would protect you finally tribulations and trials fitan are so many nowadays and nothing could protect you except Allah the almighty no one on earth can protect you except him but you have to do your due diligence you have to do your duty and it's a responsibility that you're accountable on the day of judgment for and Allah Asel says in the Quran oh you who believe protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is PE is people and Stones over which are appointed angels that are harsh and severe they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded I pray to Allah that he protects me and you and our families from the fitan whatever is visible and whatever is hidden I I pray to Allah Asel that he makes all of us stand fast on Islam live on it die upon it and be resurrected on the day of judgment under the flagship of the Prophet Muhammad wasam as Muslims I pray to Allah that he puts Baraka in our health and in our wealth and in our Offspring and in our spouses and to guide them to be the best example to the world through their behavior and their moral conduct and their religious commitment that some families or a lot of families actually uh face uh in our community is what is your advice Sheik for parents who stop their children from trying to make something Halal and get married at a young age what I'm saying is young age I'm assuming is not 12 year old but we get the high schoolers that are now in mix schools that are interested in one another and they want to make it Halal and they approach their parents with that request first of all let's look at the options on the table option one number one get them married option number two don't get them married option number one getting them married is not rocket science I'm feeding the punk I'm clothing the punk he lives under my roof he uses my car he uses my gas so what's the difference if I add another mouth that would eat with us if they say bah there will be Baraka and there's no problem in that what's a problem if I can save my son from fitna from doing Haram from fornicating and you know it's easy you don't have to wait for the prom you can do that before so what is it everyone around him is pushing him huh are you still a virgin nah come on you everything around him is tempting him and you know that you want to save him from Hellfire so what's the problem providing he checks the boxes that he's sensible he's rational he is worthy of of taking the responsibility not someone who's impulsive I marry him today he divorces tomorrow no no no this doesn't work like this you have to prove that you're a real man worthy of getting married so this is option one option two if he doesn't get married what will happen you as a father bear the responsibility but he as a individual Muslim adult also Bears the responsibility if he does Haram he'll be thrown into hell it's not a big problem but if he's unable to get married he has to fast he has to do what the prophet told himam lower his gaze and try to abide by the Shar to the best of his ability so my point is I've I know people who are 16 and 17 who are married and they are happily married they're real men I know girls who marry at the age of 15 and 16 and they're very sensible Good Housewives good uh um reasonable mothers to their children that's a win-win but you have to get out of your comfort zone you have to get out of the stigma we have and inshallah yeah things would be better bit a bit of a question inshallah uh as we all know uh going to ha from Canada from the West is extremely expensive my wife and I have been saving money to both go to Hajj but if we have saved enough for one of us only to go am I supposed to go and leave her behind sounds like this brother wants to go alone who's earning they're both earning if they're both earning how are you going to take money from her and go and make Haj no of course you can't old man for himself so if they're both earning and you save and I always say that this whether you like it or not do not have a joint account men and women must not have a joint account whether it they're both working or the man is working alone I have gone through counseling sessions like crazy and if you don't have a prenup you're going to regret this each individual in the marriage must have his own Financial uh uh um independency don't let your wife know how much you earn how much you save how much you spend and you as a wife don't let him know how much you earn how much you save and how much you spend this is your god-given right now if they both work each one of them has his own savings if she has money enough to go for Hajj and he has not uh uh collected or were saved enough because she doesn't spend she doesn't pay the rent she doesn't pay the utility bills she doesn't ship in the expenses the men are saying why because you're a man if allegedly a man doesn't allow himself to take one single penny of his wife or otherwise he's not a real man he's a wimp so have a spine I think they have orthopedic surgeons here they would help you in this but if you did not save enough for your own Hajj she cannot go without so she has to wait for you or here she can say listen honey uh I'll give you what's remaining so that we can both go to Hajj if you save more than her and you have enough money to go for Hajj but she doesn't run because on the day of judgment Allah will question you about you for not making Hajj not for her she's an independent person you're not obliged to give money for Hajj if you do you're a good man you're a good Muslim and a generous Muslim but if you don't and she doesn't have her own savings or anyone to give her she's not obliged to do Haj so don't mix oranges with apples unless you're eating cocktail fruit a question from a sister do the duties of the wife to a husband change in the current times in the western world where it's common for for wives who also participate in earning the living and supporting the household I think I've answered this I think you touched upon it yes because the duties are duties me women are not obliged to chip in a penny in the expenses now the man huh listen it has a downfall to it the man has the right to order his wife to sit home and not to work why I don't want you to work why Simon says I married you to be a housewife yeah but I have a degree in medicine and I have this and I sit home I provide for you I put a roof on your head food on your table I take care of all your expenses I don't want you to work I don't want you to mix with men she's obliged to obey but if he says Ah listen it's boring I know you you need time out you need to help your family back home and they don't have any source of income you can work but I'd like 25% of your income no this is Haram why if she's not cooking or she's obliged to bring a maate yes you bring the food cuz this is your job you uh uh hire the maate and pay for her because this is your job other than that no you're not allowed to ask her to chip otherwise we will change the roles of men in the west the roles of husbands because they change no the rules in Islam are the same all over the place this is a question from a young brother from a from high school he says many of my high school friends have girlfriends I am convinced and I know that this is not Halal what should I do as a friend to help them understand this Haram relationship if you have a box of coming back to the fruit cocktail if you have a box of rotten apples and you choose the best healthy beautiful tasty apple and put it inside will it fix them it will become rotten in couple of hours so it's sketchy so if you can make a difference without harming yourself go for it most likely you won't because everybody it's like swimming against the tide everybody is doing this and they look at you as a freak so no matter what you say especially if you talk to them in a group and you try to give them advice they'll all attack you like hyenas so stay away yes I may go to a brother one to one and remind him of Allah show him the evidences from the Quran and ask him do you like your sister to to get involved in such relationships and try to give him dawa one to one but not to address two or more at the same time they will hunt you down they will break you down so you in the first place should not be associated with such yeah Bad Company they're bad news go and look for the people of the nice guys who go five times a day to the Masjid those who are practicing and engaging in halal activities and uh hang out with them and Allah knows best this is um a question that gets repeated a lot is my husband does not allow me to look at his phone without his permission am I allowed to look at my husband office emails and messages and discussions with his friends and social media activity on his phone without his permission uh she's his mother she started by saying my husband no no no if she's who in his right mind would call himself a man and allow his wife to Snoop and put her poke her nose in things that are none of her business ditch her get rid of her get someone new younger more beautiful more religious and who would respect you a woman who pokes her nose in her husband's Affairs like this is not someone worthy to keep and at the same time a man who spies on his wife's mobile and reads her chat and I've met I've had this in counseling sessions the man I don't know if there's an app like this spies on his wife's calls and and and phones I don't know how they do this I want to get one off the Record don't throw this to my wife but he says I Spy on my wife Allah don't spy it's Haram it's a major sin so you have no business because what does it insinuate what does it mean when you want to look at your husband's chats and emails that you don't trust him any marriage that is based on this trust is not going to last long so take the decision today and move on with your life we're trying to keep the peace trying to keep the peace sometimes the peace needs War before it seriously and again yeah I I I I I I can't I do not sugarcoat unfortunately I know I'm rude I'm vulgar I am Savage you call me whatever who cares sue me but the truth is sometimes we need to slap people to wake them up if a woman does not know that she's the weakest link she will abuse her husband I have sessions with men who come to me crying in a session and the wife is next to him she I I I I clean the kids and I feed them and I own two companies and I put roof on her head I give her everything she wants and I sometimes do the dishes and all the time she abuses me she's disrespectful she curses me she talks ill about my mom he cries like a baby and she says yes because he's disrespect to me as well she she slapped me said yes because he said something inappropriate in front of me what do you expect me to say har sister come on what are you doing throw her in the trash can I tell her listen do you have a job she says no do you have an income she says no where do you come from in subcontinent where are you living in America so what are why are you doing if he divorces you what will happen you will take your two kids and go back to India what kind of a life are you going to have good maybe what is he going to do W he next week he's going going to marry someone younger more beautiful more religious and she works and she has five companies and she will make him live like a king and there are hundreds in one row you on the other hand how many will marry you if you're lucky you'll get someone who's 65 wanting a nurse not a wife if you're lucky come on the demand is far less than the supply so sometimes excuse me and sorry listen I'm not taking sides sisters I have 13 daughters I don't have a single boy alhamdulillah so definitely I'm going to side by girls and I have said it so many times I've lived among women all of my life I'm growing a uterus just pray to Allah I don't get what's after that let's stop here so it's a Masid anyhow so I'm not going to take sides of men I'm going to take sides of what Halal andam is what Shar tells you and what logic tells you to have a good marriage when you're submissive when you're obedient when you're diplomatic W he'll be like a ring in your finger you can control him like a child but when he's married to another dude the man says to me she I'm married to another man she's not a woman this is what's happening in this case and have peace we'll try to have the peace well on the subject of marriage the sister is asking a question about a brother who approached her for the purpose of marriage and she's convinced of his religious and good character so but she's not attracted to him and people are trying to convince her that these two qualities are good enough what's your advice as I said the demand is far less than the supply if a man proposes to a sister and the sister finds him checking all the boxes but unfortunately he does not have the physique of Arnold schweger or he doesn't come uh uh he's not the Knight on a shining armor or he doesn't have he's missing something well my sister or my daughter go to the nearest mirror and take a good look at yourself give me a break who do you think you are Miss Universe 2015 come on look at your teeth how many braces do you have you need look at your hair look at this look at that so each and every one of us has their flaws and shortcomings but what counts is the outcome the the the overall if the guy Mah is religious he's earning he is this his that but you don't have any feeling of resentment you don't have any any feeling of hatred meaning when he smiles I feel I'm going to get a heart attack no don't marry him he comes for the first visit and the guy smiles holy this is not good no this is someone you can't marry but if he's adequate he's okay but yeah he's not Tom Cruz so what go for it because at night and in the dark they're all alike you cannot tell as long as there is no resentment there is no ill feeling alhamdulillah you'll be good okay let's um let's go to the daytime now and ask a question and ask a question uh that that has been asked since I arrived in Canada in 1988 are we allowed to buy a house with a mortgage okay I've answered this question before 1988 but the answer would be yes you can buy a house if you buy it in a Halal transaction very easy now the question is is mortgage Halal or Haram you have to understand what mortgage is mortgage is to get a certain amount from a financial institution or a bank that you would pay over a duration of 20 years with interest you they're lending you a million dollars and they're getting back 12 uh million. 25 over the duration of 20 years now the .25 million dollar what is that any Muslim on Earth would say huh it's riba and riba is one of the seven major sins of Islam and those who are involved in it are cursed by Allah and Allah is threatening them to wage war against them so this answers your question so no yes okay question is it permissible for me to pray Isa l and do at the same time so we're delaying to almost before F time so we can combine it with this is an issue of dispute among Scholars the majority say that the time of Isa ends at midnight Islamic midnight which is measured by knowing when the sunset is when the fer is dividing it by two and adding it to M to Sunset so the Islamic Sunset now is I think 12 45 here 12:45 a.m. this is the Islamic midnight so the most authentic opinion as per the Hadith of jiel peace be upon him when he taught the prophet how to pray over two days praying in the beginning of the time and praying at the end of the time in the last day he pray just before midnight and he said to the prophet the Muslim these are the times of prayer between these so after the disappearance of the redness uh uh in the Horizon in in um the West when it disappears this is the beginning of Isa and it ends at midnight you can pray Isa at let's say 10:00 P p.m. and afterwards start to pray night prayer as much as you want there is a difference between night prayer which is the umbrella underneath it is underneath it is but it's all called night prayer so any prayer you pray after prayer when you prayed Isa you can pray night prayer until before F to delay is after midnight this is not permissible for my young brother um who's saying I'm almost a mashallah and I'm trying to keep away from all the bad and worse things things that are happening but I do fall into doing bad things every now and then what do I do welcome to the club we are all humans and we all have our ups and downs and we all have our rise and Falls but the beauty of our religion is Allah never closes the door the prophet saysat every single son of Adam is sinful but he says the best of the sinful are those who frequently repent so whenever you fall and do a sin immediately repent have deep remorse in your heart ask Allah for forgiveness and try your level best to stay the course are you going to succeed hopefully but inevitably we are sinful by default now some of us may fall in real deep sins that are so heinous and and bad and some of us may have little little small sins they see them as bad as that heinous sin it depends on your IM it depends on your religion it depends on your tawa so no matter what level you are whenever you fall whenever you trip always remember that Allah has beautiful names Asel among them is Alman Alim Al Al the most merciful the most compassionate the forgiving the one who guides to repentance and accepts it from his servants and Allah knows best a sister is asking that my husband prays super fast Terrio prayer and he thinks it's okay in today's busy world and I can see my kids now are trying to emulate and They're copying their father is there something that you can advise my husb has been regarding the s in Salah now this is again accordance to your knowledge sometimes we misjudge people and the what the misses the the the sister who's asking May misjudge the speed her husband is doing his prayer may Allah be pleased with them with him and with his father used to pray pray the Sunnah prayer very fast and his companions would come and say Hey You Prayed very fast and he would say to them have I done anything wrong meaning is my prayer invalid are my pillars missing so if I recite the fat alone in the standing position and I say subh once and I stand up how quick is this pretty quick if you see me pray like this what would you say hey you're praying too fast what should I do file for wait did I do anything wrong technically Amar said if I did not do anything wrong and my prayer is valid my pillars are valid and the mandatory acts are valid and I'm trying to escape the Whispers of shatan by doing everything to the bare minimum my prayer is valid who are you to judge me or to question me so I can't say whether the brother is super fast or you are super controlling but hypothetically hypothetically let's assume he is praying too fast there is something that is known as communication after a good meal after good sweets uh uh and and comfortable time and and joking and happy ask him honey can I say something but don't be offended yeah don't make an issue don't don't don't be angry and Shout at me yeah prepare him and speak to him advise him don't be his mother again most wives are our mothers hey don't do this why did you do this why didn't put your uh dirty uh cloth clothes in the basket why did you do Subhan Allah everything I do my wife keeps on correcting me as if she's my mother she's not so you have to be diplomatic you have to know the right time the right approach and communicate how many times have you said good things about him if you only criticize and blame and see the bad things in him and never say a good positive word he's not ever going to listen to you but this is beside the point and Allah knows bestum so this is inshallah the last question um you said in your talk about having a genuine excuse to be in a country uh where non-muslims are in majority and you walk through the otherwise it's better to be in a Muslim country a lot of people in Western countries who are connected to the Masjid they passionately feel that while there is more chance of FNA like described here but one thing that is better in these countries compared to a lot of the Muslim countries is that the freedom of speech while it's a double ET sword it helps as well a lot of pro protests that happened here we're genuinely able to to influence our local ministers and pressurize them and get our uh opinion which impacts foreign policy which doesn't happen in non-muslim countries and so then if we move back to those countries while individually we'll save our families but that Global impact that the Western Muslims have had like in Palestine and other conflicts um we're able to do that here so we're kind of taking a high risky but there's High reward so do you have anything to say to that because people can get confused uh with the original comment seriously a I have yeah I've been living like this for my entire life I care only about myself if I go to Jenna alone and all of you go to hell the hell with you seriously come on listen listen do I care yeah I would love to have you with me but I want to go to Jenna alone and whoever follows more than welcome I'm not going to risk me going to Jenna for the hope that I might take few of you with me but I'm risking it I'm not going to be a candle that gives people light while burning itself no save you yourself save your families save your kids and everyone else Allah hasel to deal with them accordingly so I wouldn't stay here to demonstrate and to influence my MPS and my representative while finding my daughter or my son maybe going astray or my wife having uh uh feminist ideas and wanting to have a divorce and sue my uh um whatever uh uh for every penny I have because I don't have a prenup so what am I doing save yourself and this is for someone who's capable of moving back and sustaining a healthy honorable standard of living don't save $50,000 and go to migrate deplete it in like 6 months and then come back begging no you have to go with a financial uh sustainable Financial income that would make you live honorably you and your family you don't want to go there for one two years and risk being kicked out coming back again to square one and rebuilding everything from scratch no you have to plan it right before you go and Allah knows best just she for the detailed answer um so this ends the Q&A session we're going to go to the next section um brother Patel from ITI we"
