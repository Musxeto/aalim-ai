  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, my question is about Tajweed When I read the Quran normally at home, Alhamdulillah I am able to follow the Tajweed, but when I am praying behind the Imam, so for example when I go to the Sujood and between the two prostrations the Dua So I read that if the Tajweed is not perfect, the words change the meaning and this renders the prayer invalid, so I wanted to ask like, how do I make sure that the Tajweed is like, do I have to make sure that the Tajweed has to be perfect during the prayer if I am praying fast? Jazakallahu Khair First of all, Tajweed is to beautify your recitation and to pronounce the letters correctly, and if you do this in a quick fashion, that would do the job. What you've heard is partially correct when the meaning changes, but if you say This is valid, you don't have to say You just say it, likewise Al-Fatiha You don't have to say This is Tajweed, but do I have to say it? No, it's not a must, you do not have to recite the Quran with Tajweed, it's highly recommended, but it's not a must You don't have to recite your Athkar in Tajweed, just pronounce it normally and move on without paying attention to it"
