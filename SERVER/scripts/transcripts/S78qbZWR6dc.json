  "transcript": "And we have Sidi from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam, Guten Tag Guten Tag, how are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah Sheikh, in my country Mauritania it became unfortunately a trend since about maybe a year that many of the women and men that they go migrating to America due to poverty or other reason maybe and now I think more than thousand migrated there so what would be your advice for all the Muslim living in Muslim country who face poverty or so and thinking about making it to a non-Muslim country? Migration we've said that many many times from a Muslim country to a Kafir country is not permissible regardless of how poor and needy you are you cannot migrate and leave your Muslim heritage and country to a Kafir country you can go for 5, 10 years, 15 years to work and gain money and then go back to your country or to any Muslim country but to migrate and fully settle down there this is totally out of the question and it's haram and I'm not hiding anything when I say that monthly I have tens of counseling sessions with second and third generation who parents or grandparents migrated to the US, Canada or Europe and the problems they're facing people are saying our children quote-unquote are out of the closet, they're drug addicts, they're criminals, they're socializing with the wrong company, they have abandoned Salat, my daughter doesn't wear the hijab doesn't have any interest in Islam and yeah we can't do anything they force our children to participate in physical education classes to go into the swimming pool with the opposite gender if my daughter is there she has to swim and wear swimsuits they learn music everything that Islam teaches they force them to do the opposite and then they come and cry to me and say what can we do Sheikh I don't know it's too late you chose the American dream or to live in such a luxurious standard of living you chose that but this comes with the territory you have to pay the price it doesn't come cheap and unfortunately your children are the price and some and a lot of the times your spouse is the price when she's liberated and she says I want out I'm not going to stay in this marriage and if you don't have a prenup she's going to sue your backside for half of your property your income whatever for the rest of your life then what so you guys have to understand that going to the west or to the east to work and improve your financial status is halal going to migrate and dispose of your Islamic identity and take a passport and give the pledge of allegiance to a kafir country or a government this is totally unacceptable"
