  "transcript": "uh maram says there are a few times in the Quran or the Hadith where it is said that Allah is how we perceive him example bukari I am as my servant thinks I am can you elaborate upon this this Hadith is a clear example that as Muslims we must think positively of Allah and this is not a choice that you can make this is an obligation because if it were a choice it would mean that you can think negatively of Allah as many ignorant imbeciles do there are Muslims that I've heard saying that I do not ask Allah to do this or that for me why he says whenever I ask Allah to do this or that for me the opposite happens are you accusing Allah of going against your wishes just to displease you are you crazy Allah doesn't need you Allah doesn't need the whole population of Earth the seven billion of them Allah doesn't need the trillions of animals of fish of insects of birds Allah is independent and it's only Allah that provides for all of these only Allah that facilitates their Affairs he's the sustainer he's The Giver of life and death he's the Creator he's the provider so so why would you think so negatively of Allah and refrain from expressing your submissiveness your poverty your humility to him subhanahu wa taala this is an indication of your arrogance this is an indication that you and Satan have many things in common which is a very very dangerous aspect so Allah is as you think of him if you think of him positively your Affairs would at the end of the day materialize for your benefit and you will be the winner if you choose otherwise you're the Biggest Loser and you're the only one who's going to suffer no one on earth is going to care what happens to you Allah Asel would not be harmed by you thinking negatively of him or saying bad things about him Allah is self-sufficient so you have no choice other than to love him to think of him positively to acknowledge that he owns you and everything in this universe and that he does what he Wills no one has the right to question him or to doubt him in addition to the fact that you have to express your poverty and your humility and to ask and call him so that he would answer your call because you're the one who needs him and not the other way around"
