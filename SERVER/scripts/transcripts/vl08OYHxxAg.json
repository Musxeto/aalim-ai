  "transcript": "Salam Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. It's a way to open my heart. How to fill the emptiness in my heart? Even if I do five times a day, I have heart medicine, I do not do drugs, I do not go out at all, but my heart is still empty. Now, the emptiness of the heart is due to the fact that you did not fill it up with the right thing. The heart is like this glass, you fill it to the top with water, I cannot add anything else, because it will overflow. But if it's half full, you can put something that would mix with it. A lot of us do five times prayer, not because we love prayer, because we are accustomed to it. Our parents pray, we pray, and this is why a lot of us, when they travel, they don't pray. A lot of the Saudis, and I speak about Saudis, Arabs, when they travel to Europe, they do Jama' Asr, first three days, Dhuhr Asr, Maghreb Isha. After three days, they do Jama' at the end of the night, Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghreb, Isha, in three minutes. After five days, no Salat at all. After they come two, three weeks, they go and make Umrah, Astaghfirullah, and then they start praying. Their prayer is not from the heart, it's customs, it's because everybody is praying. And this is a very big problem. If the prayer is not initiated from the heart, and you're praying for the sake of Allah, then you have this emptiness in your heart. How to fill it up? Number one, with the Quran, with the dhikr, with the knowledge about Islam, with good companions. Most likely, the sister who's asking this question has no Muslim sisters associated with her. And this is what I always find in my counseling session, when people say, I have anxiety, I have this, I say, do you have Muslim friends? He said, no, I'm always in my room, alone. He said, this is why. The Prophet said, the wolf eats from the sheep, the one that goes astray. When the sheep are together, the wolf stays away, until one of the sheep says, I'm fed up, I want to go for a smoke. The sheep goes, then the wolf attacks. So when you're with the friends, with the Muslims, you're united. Muslim united. They told me I have to make an endorsement. So when you are with the Muslims, you become strong. But when you're alone, this is when shaitan comes. Open TikTok, open YouTube, watch this alone. I don't have anything. I don't have anything. So don't ever be alone. Fill your heart with hafidh al-Quran, with dhikr of Allah Azza wa Jal, with knowing who Allah is. Imagine, how many years did the Prophet spend in Mecca? Thirteen. Doing what? There was no salat, except in the last couple of years. There was no zakat, there was no fasting, there was no umrah, there was no hajj, there was no divorce, marriage, transactions, nothing. What was he doing 13 years in Mecca? He was teaching people arkan ul-iman, who Allah is, what is the day of judgment, what are the angels, what are the prophets, what are the scriptures, what is al-qadr. And this is what you have to fill your heart with, if you want to get real, proper iman, and Allah knows best."
