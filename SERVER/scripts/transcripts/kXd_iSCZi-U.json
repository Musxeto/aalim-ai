  "transcript": "Dima from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Salam to Allah So my question is if we buy a gift with the intention for giving it to a specific person but then we give it to someone else, would that be haram or is it okay? Now the issue of buying a gift, the gift is not binding or mandatory until it is possessed by the recipient. So I buy this mug and I tell someone this, I'm buying this for you and I bought it but I don't give it to him and I possess it. Then I change my mind and I said, whoa this mug looks nice, I'm gonna keep it. The guy has no right to say, hey you promised me, you're gonna give me this. No, until I give it to him and he possesses it, it's not his, it's mine and I can do whatever I want. So if I buy a gift with the intention to give it to x person and then I see y person to be a better recipient or more in need or I just simply don't want to give it to x anymore, there is no problem at all in changing my intention."
