  "title": "What should we Imagine when the name of Allah is mentioned",
  "transcript": "Shahid from India Sheikh, I have a question. We know that our human minds are not capable of imagining Allah. But when we come across the name Allah, when we hear the name Allah, what are we supposed to think? What are we supposed to think? We like to think the name of Allah in Arabic because we can't imagine Allah. So what are we supposed to have in our minds when we hear the word of Allah or should it be nothing in our minds? Are you worshipping the writing of Allah, the name Allah? Of course not. Are you worshipping Ar-Rahman, the writing of Ar-Rahman? Of course not. Can anyone imagine Allah Azza wa Jal? Certainly not because Allah is beyond our imagination. So what is it that we should imagine? Nothing. What you imagine is the overwhelming feeling of knowing who Allah is, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the sustainer of this world, the provider, the facilitator, the giver of life and death. This is what you imagine encompassing your chest when you hear the name of Allah Azza wa Jal. Not an image or something of such a nature or the name itself. This is all not correct. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-ithnillah Azza wa Jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-ithnillah."
