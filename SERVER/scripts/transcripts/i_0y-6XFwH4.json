  "title": "If someone praises me WITHOUT saying Allahâ€™humma barik, should I make Ruqyah? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Suham from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu So if I heard somebody praising me too much but then I tell them to say Allahumma Barak after like 20 seconds I have to remember it but like he said it late and there's no symptoms of Nazr but like one or two so should I like do Ruqya or not? No need to do Ruqya as long as you observe your daily Adhkar. If you observe your daily Adhkar in the morning, in the evening, after Fard prayer, before going to bed, and before leaving the house and you do this religiously as mentioned for example in the Fortress of the Muslim on my YouTube channel there's a playlist by the name of the Fortress of the Muslim where I explained with the grace of Allah Azza wa Jal the different types of Adhkar and when to say them and where to say them. If you observe these Adhkar you don't care about what people give you Nazr or evil eye because you're protected with the grace of Allah Azza wa Jal."
