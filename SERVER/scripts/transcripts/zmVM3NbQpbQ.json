  "title": "Can we blow on our food or drink when it's hot? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sumaya says can we blow on our food or drinks before consuming it especially when it's hot the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam prohibited us from breathing in the vessel when we drink so if I'm drinking I should hold my breath drink and then breathe but to hold it and to breathe into it this is prohibited whether it's my own or it is something that is shared by the people if it is shared by the people this is logically understood because those who are going to use it after me would be repelled by seeing me do this or maybe something would fall into it that would not be hygienic and not be something pleasant to a person drinking from it but if it's my own cup some scholars say that this is still prohibited even if it's your own because the restriction is general and some said no if it's your own cup then there is nothing wrong in blowing into it especially if it is hot so this was reported from a number of sources of the scholars that this is permissible whether it is permissible or not if there is a need for it and it's your own mug or glass or vessel then there is no problem in blowing in it to either remove any impurity or to make it colder if it is too hot for you to consume but just to be on the safe side if it's hot and you want it to get cold you can empty it in another vessel a couple of times until it becomes a cooler rather than to blow into it so just to be safe and to avoid doing what the Prophet had restricted alayhi salatu was-salam"
