  "transcript": "May Allah bless you Sheikh and grant you the highest rank in Jannah. And you as well Akhi. So the question is while taking videos or photos we inevitably capture or record other people who are present in the background. So are we sinful that we are invading the privacy or clicking the pictures without their permission or it can be cascaded to like houses. Of course we know that clicking the pictures of non-Muslim women is completely haram and we should delete them. But what about this and the next question would be like if we have this picture should weâ€¦ No we have only policy of one question Shuaib. As for your picture that you take of real estate or landscapes or a friend and other people appear in the background without their permission and it's halal, their men or children, there is nothing wrong in that inshaAllah because this was unintentional and not deliberate. This is different from when you see a person like me walking and you take a picture of him without his permission. I wouldn't say that it would be haram but it would be unethical. But if I was walking in the background and another person was taking a photo of a landscape or of another person and I appeared in the picture in the background, there is nothing wrong in that inshaAllah."
