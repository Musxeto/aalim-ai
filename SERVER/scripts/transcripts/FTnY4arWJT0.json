  "transcript": "Siham from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I have heard that our Prophet has said, ìMy Ummah will never be in misguidance.î Does it mean that the consensus of the scholar will never be wrong? Correct. This is the correct interpretation of the Hadith. ìMy Ummah would never agree and all collectively agree on a misguidance.î We know that the consensus of the Muslims at a certain time or level is one of the evidences of Shari'ah. So we have the Qur'an, then we have the Sunnah, and then we have the consensus. So if we have the consensus of the Muslims of something at a particular time or era, the Shari'ah, and Allah knows best. Ameen."
