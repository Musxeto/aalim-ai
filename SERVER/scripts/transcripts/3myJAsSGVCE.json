  "title": "Can we Raise our hands and make Dua AFTER SUNNAH Prayer? Best place to make Dua & when?",
  "transcript": "Suad from UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, I am aware that it is not recommended to raise one's hands and make du'a after obligatory prayer. However, is it okay to raise hands and make du'a during sunnah prayer like the 12 rakah or salatul du'a? Do you mean that while I am praying du'a prayer, if I raise my head from the first sujood and I'm sitting between the two sujoods and I say, O Allah, igfirli, irhamni, irzukhni, do you mean this? No, I mean after the salam. After the salam, after, listen to me, making it a habit to raise your hands after fard salah or voluntary salah is an innovation. Making it every time is an innovation, is a bid'ah. Now, let me ask you a question, Suad. Why do you raise your hands and make du'a? What do you want? I pray for my family or myself. I pray for my health. I want to make du'a for my parents and myself. You want Allah to answer you, right? Yes, Sheikh. Okay. If you know that Allah pledged upon himself to answer you if you're doing your du'a in sujood, would you still do it after salah? Yes or no? Yes. No, Sheikh. See, this is the problem. The imbecile brother who said yes, it shows that he's not even understanding what I'm saying. Allah, the Almighty, told us and the Prophet ﷺ told us in an authentic hadith, the closest you are to Allah is when you are in sujood. The Prophet ﷺ goes on to say, so make and choose whatever du'a you want in sujood. So, who in his right head and mind would neglect making du'a in sujood as the Prophet ﷺ directed us and ordered us? He says, no, I want to make du'a after fard prayer, and wipe his body and washes it and showers it and puts some conditioning on his hair after every single salah. This is pathetic. The Prophet is telling you, make du'a in sujood, Allah will answer you. And he said, no, thanks, not interested. So, Su'ad, you want Allah to protect your family, to increase your health, to do this and that, do it in your sujood and stop everything else. Now, shouldn't we raise our hands and make du'a? I didn't say that. What I said was, do not make it a habit that after every fard salah, or after every voluntary salah, you raise your hand and make du'a because the Prophet ﷺ never did this. However, between adhan and iqamah, adhan is called. I said my adhkar, I did my repetition, or I repeated after the mu'adhin, and I said the adhkar, and then between adhan and iqamah, I can raise my hands and make du'a. In the middle of the night, I wake up, I pray tahajjud, and I want to take a break of 10 minutes, I raise my hands and make du'a. It's raining, not men. And I make, raise my hands and make du'a. It is the rooster sound before fajr, one hour, and I hear the rooster's voice, I make du'a because it saw an angel. The Prophet ﷺ said, ask Allah from his grace, whenever you hear a rooster. These are the times where I raise my hand and make du'a, no problem. But not after every fard prayer, not after every voluntary prayer. I hope this answers your question."
