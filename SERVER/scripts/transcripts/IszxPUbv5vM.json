  "transcript": "Abu Ali from the U.S. My question is in regards to the seal of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ with the ring. I was told that this ring, I saw it online and it's being sold online, but I heard somewhere where it should not be replicated. Would you be able to elaborate on this? Thank you. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam. If I understand your question, we know that the Prophet ﷺ was instructed by his companions when he wanted to dispatch messages to the kings of different nations around him calling them to Islam. And this is what all rulers should do, invite people like the Prophet ﷺ invited people to Islam. His companions told him that such kings and rulers would not accept a letter that is not sealed. So we know that these letters are wrapped and placed in an envelope or in a roll. They had to seal it with wax or something that would ensure it is not broken or read by someone else to avoid tampering. So it's a sort of authenticating it. So the Prophet ﷺ took a ring which is his seal that had the engravement of Muhammad Rasool Allah. And some websites reverse it by putting Allah Rasool Muhammad because they say that we have to bring Allah's names on top. The most authentic is that it was written in that order, Muhammad Rasool Allah, as it's stated. So whenever he wrote a letter, meaning his companions wrote a letter through his dictation, he would seal it with that ring. Replicating it is no problem. It's replicated everywhere. It's not sacred that one should not mimic it or duplicate it. There's no problem in that, none whatsoever. And apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
