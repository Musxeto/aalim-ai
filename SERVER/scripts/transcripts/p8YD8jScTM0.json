  "title": "What exactly is ACTING upon sins? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh question uh from the what's up what exactly is acting upon sins is it actually attempting to do the sin or any action in accordance to the sin like if i'm thinking of murdering someone and then i just swing my hand across the air thinking that i hit the person and now he's dead without having the determination to do so in real life is this acting or when i actually go to the person and then i stab him is this acting no acting is not gesturing acting is actual act so for example if i see a beautiful woman now the prophet said allah allah has forgiven my ummah for my sake for whatever intrusive thoughts that may cross their minds as long as they don't speak about it nor act upon it so i saw this beautiful woman and said what a beautiful bombshell i didn't say anything to anybody and i moved on i ask allah for forgiveness allah will forgive me but if i wear to approach that woman and she smiles into my face and i smile to our face and i say we have to stop meeting like this and i start to flirt or to speak now this is acting upon that intrusive thoughts that i got and this is one of the ways where shaytan messes up with your head where he casts his doubts and makes you think that no i may have acted upon it or not when it's actually acting upon it is to do something to go to the market and buy something this is acting upon it not a gesture someone does or a smile someone does when he's alone and he says oh did i act upon kufr i had a thought that was inappropriate and i smiled is this acting upon it no this is not acting upon it and allah azza knows best you"
