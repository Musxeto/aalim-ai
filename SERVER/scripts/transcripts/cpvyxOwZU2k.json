  "title": "Advice for Muslims who Consider Riba to be Lawful in this Modern World - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr Zaki the next issue we need to bring up is Reba again one of the major sins and unfortunately nowadays many Muslims consider Reba to be completely lawful in this modern world that we live in what's your advice according to Quran and Sunnah I do agree that there are many Muslims who consider RBA not to be interest and the think it's lawful but riba means anything over and above it includes user that's exorbitant interest but it even includes interest because by definition interest is money earned or money lent and user is exorbitant interest so whether it's small or big RBA is Haram it includes interest as well as Usery and Allah subhana wa ta'ala has used the word riba in the Quran no less than eight times it's me in Surah al- Imran chapter number 3 vers number 130 Sur chapter number 4 verse number 161 in Surah Bak chapter number 2 verse number 275 it has been used Thrice it's even mentioned in Surah Bak chap 2 verse number 276 as well as Surah bakar CH 2:s 278 and 279 where Allah says in these two verses that give up your demands of RBA of interest of user and those who do not give up the demands of riba take notice of a war from Allah and his rasool that means if you indulge in RBA Allah and his will wage a war against you there are other major sins like having intoxicants having alcohol drugs Etc but this besides being a major sin the ruling is that Allah and hiso will wage a war against you it is the only verse in the Quran for the only major sin where Allah and war against you it is R so it's one of the biggest BJ sins that is the reason it has been rated in the category number 12 in Al by imabi mention number 12 and as far as the punishment is concerned it's mention say Muslim volume number three Hadith number 3881 the Beloved Prophet mallah Ali wasallam he cursed those people who accept RBA and who give those who take interest and give interest those who record it as well as the two witnesses all of them are the same the prophet said that all these people are cursed the person who gives RBA the person who takes the person who records RBA the person who a witness all of them are cursed and all of the same level it's further mentioned in Hadith number 2259 the Beloved Prophet m said that there are 73 different types of RBA different degrees of Rah and the lowest one is equivalent to a man doing Z with his mother with the lowest level of riba or the 73 level is equivalent to a man doing Z with his mother and this is a and it's mentioned in mus Ahmed volume number five page number 225 also in same Hadi repeated in say alj Hadith number 3375 the Beloved Prophet said that anyone who takes RBA equivalent to one Dam it's worse than a man committing Z 36 times if you take one Dam of it's worse than a man committing Z 36 times so this is the punishment and the enormity of sin in Islam and we see today that most of the Western countries they are drowned in RBA everything is an interest you take a loan on interest you can take a house on interest you can take a car on interest the credit card so everyone and in this scenario it makes a poor man more poor it can make many rich men go bankrupt otherwise the other people are rich man become more rich and there are various evils and I've given a talk on this topic interest free economy promulgated by the Glorious Quran that have proved all the evils of ARA and we see that today a man will make more profit if he has the concept of Islamic business profit and loss sharing rather than based on interest that's the reason most of the top companies they're zero debt companies they don't take loan from the bank they prefer opening issues and having shares and sharing the prophet with the public that the Islamic concept and all the top companies they debt free companies you'll find that they don't take any loan so they are working actually on the Islamic Concepts"
