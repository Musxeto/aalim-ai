  "transcript": "Talha from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my friend affirms Allah's attributes but he doesn't affirm the meaning and he leaves the meaning to Allah because he thinks it's the safest option to avoid misinterpretation. Is this correct and how should I guide him? No this is not this is not the correct uh thing to do this is what Al-Mufawwida believe in. They believe in the attributes but the meaning is for Allah Azza Wa Jal. No the meaning is known to us in Arabic. The how or to give a similarity to it is what we refrain as Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah and we understand what the meaning is and leave it to Allah Azza Wa Jal. This is different than saying I know Allah is all hearing and that he hears but I just leave it. I don't say that he hears sounds or that he listens to different languages at the same time and he understands everything and hears everything. No this is not the right thing and Allah knows best."
