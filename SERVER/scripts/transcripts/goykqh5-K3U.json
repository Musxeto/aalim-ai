  "transcript": "like a sister says I have four young children and suffer with disability may allah azza wajal cure her and grant her health and strength so in short she says that this is disability makes performing Woodill very hard for her and she does her best to perform salat on time so when it comes to washing her feet it is very difficult she has multiple sclerosis and she cannot raise her foot to the basin and to wash it etc so can she sprinkle water on her feet the answer is yes see what is your what you are required to do when making wudu is to wash the areas your or to wash so if I'm ordered to wash my arm until the elbows the best thing is to put water and to wash it and rub my limb my arm but if I just turn on the faucet and I just put my arms underneath and it is totally soaked and washed there's not an area that is dry Palace that does the job if I put my arm in a bucket of water and it's dipped in it and it's completely washed that's it so likewise if you sprinkle water with a hand sprinkler or hand shower on your feet and wash it well that does the job in sha Allah and may Allah make it easy for you"
