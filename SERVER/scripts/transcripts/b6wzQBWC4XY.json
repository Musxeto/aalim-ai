  "title": "Family gives Zakat to elderly women living in a home without knowing if they are poor or needy, must",
  "transcript": "Bint Adam from Pakistan. Sheikh, if someone in my family, he wants to distribute their Zikah to various places, they may fetch about a place like old home from internet, where there are like ladies 50 plus and they take the cash and give whatever they need according to their needs. Should I be letting them know or guiding them that it is better to, you know, trust someone that we are sure of that can distribute it properly? Should I just let them distribute to wherever they want to, especially when these places just gather stuff and they may not necessarily give cash? This is their problem. If they trust that the women in such places or homes are poor or needy, if they trust that, then they can give them their Zakat. There is no problem in that. But if just because they live in a home without knowing whether they're needy or poor and they keep on giving them the Zakat, no, this is not permissible. You have to at least have some sort of certainty that they are needy and that they are poor in order for you to give your Zakat too. If you have any questions, please contact me at www.arabiccounseling.com Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And by Allah's permission, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, by Allah's permission. www.arabiccounseling.com"
