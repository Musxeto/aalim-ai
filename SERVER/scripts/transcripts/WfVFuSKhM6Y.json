  "transcript": "from Australia uh does does not being able to say fulfilling all the conditions like if you can't say it for like one day or like couple days because you know like your IM is low does that nullify it like nullify your Islam what do you mean by not fulfilling the conditions I don't understand um like you can't say it like one day like you can't can't feel like the full submission or love or something like this this is something that you do not have on you on a chick checklist before you say ill everyone says ill gazillion times per day and night out of the love of Allah yes sometimes we are heedless sometimes we are not not concentrating we're saying it just because we want to say it but you don't have to have the seven conditions fulfilled at that particular moment and hence it has no impact on your Islam at all and Allah Knows Best"
