  "title": "Is it mandatory to advise the same gender on Social Media, if we see something Haram? | Assim Al",
  "transcript": "my question was that i watched one of your videos in which you said that it is permissible for women to watch videos of other women who are not wearing hijab and if there is music you should just mute it and if like she's cooking something or like that but i watched another one of your videos in which you said that it is mandatory for a muslim that if he sees a post on social media or something in which haram is being committed and the person who is doing that haram is of the same gender as him then he has to advise them so do i have to draw the conclusion that every single video that i watch of a woman doing like this i should advise her to wear the hijab or not trip music or every single post i see on social media i have to advise them okay i will answer you inshallah she says when i see some women on vlogs whether cooking or doing something should i comment and tell them that this is haram what you're doing you have to cover you have to stop the music if you can't do that that's excellent that's great but if you won't reach there or like so many people disabled their their comments so if you go to my youtube channel you'll see that comments are disabled whoa why sheikh are you afraid of criticism no but i'm i don't want people to be misguided lots of people put trash in the comments so why would i open the floor for them you don't want to listen to what i have to say there are so many other people you can follow and watch be my guest so yes if you can enjoin virtue and righteousness excellent if you cannot then in this case there is no sin on you and allah knows best"
