  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India Allah created Prophet \nAdam (Peace and Blessing be Upon Him) the Angels   asked are you going to put someone on Earth who \nwill cause corruption and shed blood in the land   so my question is how the how did the Angels \npredicted this when Prophet Adam (Peace and   Blessing be Upon Him) was the first human \nbeing how did the angles knew this thank you   there is a number of justifications one of them \nis that Allah told them that this will happen   and that Adam will eat from The Forbidden tree \nand be ordered to descend to Earth some Scholars   say that they figured out because he was not \nmasoom he was not infallible rather he was a   human being who can make mistakes and errors that \nthis would inevitably happen from his offspring   others say that before the humans on Earth there \nwere Jinn and this was the trend of the Jinn   fighting and shedding blood between one another \nand killing one another so they thought that   when Adam and his offspring would be descended to \nEarth they would follow suit and Allah Knows Best"
