  "title": "If I perform Sunnah Ghusl & delay washing the feet until end, is the gap ok & is Wudu valid",
  "transcript": "[Music] my today's question is for a friend if we perform ghost as per the sunnah while we are not in the state of impurity like for friday for example will it suffice for wudu if we delay washing our feet until the end jazakallahu wajazak hamza from bosnia he says if i perform russell according to the sunnah so i'm following the steps of the sunnah which as you all know it includes wudu so if i do this and i perform a full wudo with the exception of delaying my washing of the feet till the end of the russell would my woodla be valid the answer is the gap is negligible so washing the rest of your body would not take more than a minute or half a minute and the whole area is wet and the whole body is wet so it's negligible inshallah is valid but to be on the safe side make a full wardu with washing the feet to be safe you"
