  "title": "Can I inherit from my non Muslim father if my mom & I are the only legal heirs? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi How are you today? Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Alameen Okay Sheikh, so we are the family of three. I and my mom are three boys but my father is a non-Muslim so when I told my father that Muslims cannot inherit anything from non-Muslims he said that after his death all his property belongs to me and my mother and we can use his property so he oppressed us so is this statement of my father sufficient for me and my mother to inherit from him or we need to write this on a piece of a paper so according to my country law which is a public country I and my mom are only hires to his property legally so no one can legally claim anything from this property so we two are the only hires so do we need to bring male or female witnesses or write this on a piece of blank paper in front of with them or he's saying he's sufficient what actually is the process? First of all the Prophet said that a Kafir does not inherit a Muslim and a Muslim cannot inherit a Kafir and by this hadith we understand that you cannot inherit your father if he is a non-Muslim however scholars say that if the non-Muslim gives away as a will from his wealth the Muslims can accept this will being as a gift but providing it does not exceed one third of his wealth so if he has three hundred thousand dollars you and your mom may share a hundred thousand which is one third this is what Islam allows you to do not as inheritance because you do not share the same religion rather as a will and a gift what about the remaining two hundred thousand the remaining two hundred thousand if the laws of the country state that you take them because you are the only heirs you may take them and dispose of them in means of Muslim charity poor or needy Muslims or to give it in Dawah supporting for Islam or building a masjid etc in order to cleanse your wealth from it so that it would not go to this Kafir government and Allah knows best"
