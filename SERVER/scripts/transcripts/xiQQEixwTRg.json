  "title": "Sunnah To Raise hands after Fatiha as if they are making Dua while saying AMEEEEEN",
  "transcript": "Zaynuddin from the UK Okay, I wanted to ask on the ruling on raising the hands once you, after you recite the Fatiha. Some people after they recite the Fatiha, they raise their hands and say Ameen as if they're making Dua. Okay. Would you like me to, what's the ruling on that? Okay, I will answer you In Sha Allah. So, what Zaynuddin is referring to is during Fatiha, some people when they recite it and they come to the end and say Ghairul mawdubi alayhim wa raddaalliin, Ameen, they do this. Of course this is a clear innovation. And I don't know where these people are getting this, but most likely they are like orangutans, with all due respect. They see people do things and say, Whoa, this looks nice. Sometimes while the Imam is reciting, Shahidallahu anahu la ilaha illa hu, the moment they see or hear the Shahada, they say, La ilaha, what are you doing? This is not the Shahad. But they move their finger whenever Allah is mentioned in standing position. This is an innovation. But I saw people do this. It looked cool, man. So I picked it up. After Fajr, doing the Adhkar, all of a sudden one of them just goes in prostration. Hey, what are you doing? He said, this is shukrana sujood, this is showing my gratitude to Allah. For what? He said, for everything Allah has given me. I do this every Fajr. And six, seven people around the masjid look at him, look cool. And they start picking it up. Innovation. They're sinful. And they'll be punished for that. So what they're doing of raising their hands when saying ameen is totally prohibited. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all. Bi-idhnillah."
