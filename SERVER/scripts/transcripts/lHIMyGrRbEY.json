  "title": "Different types of dreams; do early morning dreams come true? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says are all dreams true if not how to differentiate among the dreams and dreams of which time of the day or night come true as people say dreams that we see in early mornings come true dreams people nowadays place on them a lot of emphasis and importance and we don't ask psychiatrists about the nature of dreams and whether they come true or not because this is something that is not studied properly and the results are not certain it's all theories while when we go to the Quran and to the sooner we find that there are different types of dreams the famous the most famous dream of all in the Quran the dream that Ibrahim peace be upon him saw and he told his son that he had seen in a vision in a dream that he is slaughtering him and we know that the dreams of prophets are a revelation and we know the rest of the story we also have the dream of the king of Egypt who saw seven skinny cows eating seven fat cows and you know the story where use of peace be upon him interpreted it and it was the reason that he was set free and later on became the aziz of Egypt in the Sunna the Prophet salatu wassalam used to after fajar prayer asked people who had seen a dream and he would interpret it for them and sometimes the Companions would engage in interpreting it and this tells us that the middle path is not to say that everything we see is true but also it's not to be ignored totally so how do we classify dreams first of all without any doubt any dream that you wake up feeling depressed frightened sad because of it this is from Shaitan and this is one of the points in the job description of Shaitaan to sadden and to depress a believer Allah mentioned this in the Quran in so many places if it is something that you wake up feeling good about it this can be one of two either it is a good vision from allah azza wajal and it's a glad tiding of something good going to happen or it is something that you wish and desire so your sub-conscience makes you feel and see and touch what you desire in the sahir the prophet said Atticus alot of Salaam that dreams are of three types one is a vision from allah azza wajal and a good dream is one part of 46 parts of prophethood and this is hadith authentic which means that after the Prophet Allah solution there is no prophethood only these glad tidings that are giving to people that are considered to be one part of 46 parts of prophethood what does that mean before the Prophet al-islam became a prophet for six months before revelation he used to see dreams that come accurately and are fulfilled exactly as he had seen them and this was for the duration of six months and he lived after that after becoming a prophet for 23 years so multiply 23 by 2 you get 4 to 6 and 6 months is the part that the Prophet as I'm used to see of that now this is the first part the Prophet says Isis on the second type of dreams are whispers of Shaitaan this is when you wake up and you saw snakes and scorpions and dogs running after you eating your life being thrown into fire having calamity you wake up frightened whether it's for you or for someone else this is from straight on what to do the Prophet said erase also whenever you see something you dislike in a dream just when you wake up say I will let him in a straight on your regime three times and then spit dryly to your left like this dry spit and do not speak about it to any soul never go to a friend a parent a sibling a spouse telling them well I had a scary dream last night and it was about this and that no the Prophet says it's Haram it's not permissible for you to do and he said that if you don't say anything about it and you do the procedure that I had just described the Prophet said Alice or Sam it will not harm you it will not harm you so it's just a dream yes share much it's occupying my mind forget it it's not it's nothing it's just from Shaitaan the third part of the dreams that the Prophet told us about Allah so Sam is what your sub-conscience dictates upon you and this is what you meet and feel during the day so for example a mechanic when he goes to bed he's thinking about car engines and how to fix them how to make them stronger he may see himself in a race car or inventing a new engine or anything of that sort which is his sub-conscience dictating it to him a person and this is a story they say about a sheikh and his student the student came to the Sheikh and said oh sure I loved the Prophet so much but I haven't seen him in one dream of mine so the Sheikh told him okay you spend the night in my house today so the student went to his share and the chef prepared dinner for him and he put a lot of garlic a lot of salt a lot of things that make you thirsty and after dinner every time the student asks for water and he says we don't have any water maybe later on maybe before we go to bed and he did not give him water and they went to sleep and then they woke up they went to pray fire and came back and then the chef asked a student what did you see the students said ah I saw a lot of rivers and it was raining it was so many many things that involve water and so much water that means subhanAllah your thirst was sincere so your dreams came true and had your love to the Prophet I saw some was sincere you would have seen him in your dream and it's really Malik may Allah be pleased with him said rarely a night passes without me seeing the Prophet Harry saw some in a dream and we know how much love Anasuya nematic had to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam therefore these are the three types that the prophet sallallaahu re al salam told us about now is there any time of the day or night that people when they see a dream it is usually a fact that it would come true the answer is no the answer is no you could see a dream after fajar you can see a dream before fajar after a sir this has no significance at all it can be one of the three types that the Prophet had told us about and Allah knows best"
