So in a hadith, once the Prophet addressed the Companions, he said, listen, I am to you as a father to his children, so I teach you. When you defecate, do not face the Qibla or you give your backs to it. And he orders of three stones to cleanse yourself with, which is like toilet tissues and three wipes minimum. And he forbade them from using dung or bones in cleaning themselves. And he prohibited a person to clean himself using his right hand. So the Prophet gave an introduction to his teachings with these beautiful words, I am like a father to his children."
