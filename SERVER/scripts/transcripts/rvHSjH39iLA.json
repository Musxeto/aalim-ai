  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh my father suddenly passed away over three years ago on his bed and since then I have kept his furniture and belongings in his room exactly as they were. Recently we added more furniture to the house and due to limited space we need to rearrange the existing furnishing including his room. However Sheikh I feel deeply attached to the current setup of his room and the thought of changing makes me heartbroken due to many emotional reasons. So Sheikh is it permissible to hold on to such emotions and avoid rearranging his room only for this reason? Fahim are you the only heir of your father or there are other heirs? I have one younger sister. And mother? Yes. So your mom your mom is entitled to one-eighth of whatever is in that room and your sister is entitled to one-third of the remaining after her mom's portion is taken. You cannot restrict them from taking what is their right. It's their inheritance. If they give it to you as a gift then it is your right to keep it, to sell it, or to give it as a gift to those who are poor and needy. And if you ask my opinion your father would use the good deeds if you were to sell it or if you were to give it to someone in need because that would benefit him more in his grave than merely sentimental feelings you get when you see his furniture and stuff. This is not going to benefit him. Rather it's always going to remind you of him and stir the sorrows and the pain in your heart which is not very normal or logical."
