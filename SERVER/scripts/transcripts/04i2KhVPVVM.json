  "title": "Can I change the niyyah intention of prayer from a Fard to Sunnah or Sunnah to Fard",
  "transcript": "yes sir as per my knowledge we cannot change the intention after starting the first salah what about the nafil can i change the induction after starting nafil salad to another nephew for example i started playing with her and i remembered that i didn't pray to raqqa as soon as so can i change my intention from vitro to sunnate while in the salah if not what to do in such circumstances okay and then let me correct your information you can change the intention from your fart salat during fort salat to something less so if i'm praying vohur prayer alone in the masjid because i missed the congregation and then i hear a new patch of worshippers praying jamara i can change my intention from vahrehvah into sunnah of two raka's conclude it and then go catch up the fart with them to do the opposite is not permissible so sunnah prayer i remember that oh i did not pray the previous so i changed my intention not permissible i'm praying with her and i'd like to pray another similar to it which is not permissible but i can make it into a general two raka's of voluntary prayers then do whatever i want and i hope this answers your question you"
