  "title": "Ruling on women wearing socks while praying (reveals shape of foot) mandatory to cover? | Assim Al",
  "transcript": "latifah says what's the ruling on praying wearing socks because some scholars say that wearing socks is also not permissible because it gives the shape of the foot well there are things that you cannot hide a woman's height cannot be hidden a woman's size cannot be hidden so things that cannot be hidden are exempted and likewise the size of the foot nobody normally speaking unless those who have fetish feelings etc i don't know what they call it would be looking at the size of the foot because all feet look the same likewise when you wear a glove all hands look the same with a glove on so this is permissible inshallah and there's no problem in doing that to add some more information is praying while covering the defeat for women mandatory it's an issue of dispute uh the maliki and the shaffer school of thought say it is mandatory to cover the feet and the hanafi's code of thought and an opinion imam ahmad and it was adopted also by sheikh zamen tamiya and that it is not mandatory so without any doubt it's the safest opinion to cover because if you come on the day of judgment covering your feet while praying nobody would criticize yourself why did you do that but if you prayed without covering your feet during salat there is a possibility according to the maliki in the shaffer school of thought and other scholars like that your prayer is invalid so why risk it safe rather than soaring you"
