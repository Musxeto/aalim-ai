  "transcript": "yes the question is that is it permissible to eat food wearing shoes or footwear like the food is kept in share and we are sitting food is kept in table and we are sitting in chair eating food wearing shoes or any footwear is it allowed okay shimshad from india says what's the ruling on eating while wearing your shoes while putting your shoes on and there's nothing shy by wrong in eating while i'm wearing my shoes on or wearing my socks on or wearing my trousers on unless i'm eating with my feet and this is a little bit difficult to do with your shoes so basically speaking there's nothing in islam at all even if you're sitting on the floor on the ground not in a on a table if you're sitting on the ground cross-legged and you're eating while wearing your shoes there is nothing wrong in that at all"
