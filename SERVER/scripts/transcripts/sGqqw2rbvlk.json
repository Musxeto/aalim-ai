  "transcript": "Mature from the UK Hello Sheikh, I just want to ask, I heard about cats and camels, are they made from fire or not? I don't understand any of your question. Can you repeat that? I heard, you know, the camel and the cat, made from fire. No, no, this is not true. Camels and cats are not made from fire. Only the jinn is made from fire. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, In Sha Allah, within the following two days or three days. And by Allah's permission, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, by Allah's permission."
