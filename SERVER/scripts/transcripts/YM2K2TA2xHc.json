  "title": "Should I reject a man working in a mixed school considering my mental and health issues? ï¿¼",
  "transcript": "Anna from Uganda Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh This is a recording. I have some issues in the speech. My question is, I had gotten a potential suitor. He is from a good Muslim family. But there is some doubts in his religious commitment. Because he works in a mixed school. Mixed boys and girls. So I don't know if I can compromise this. And if I find out that he is someone that is not advisable to leave the job, can I call it off? Keeping in mind that I also have some issues with me. Like five main issues. Okay, I'm mentally ill. I have some signs of cancer. And some other issues. So what should I do? First of all, if he is a practicing Muslim, and the only thing that worries you is that he works in a mixed school, where he has to teach boys and girls, this is not an issue. He's the breadwinner. And he's obliged to provide for his family. And this is what he knows. And this is the norm in the country where he lives. Therefore, as long as he's a good Muslim and he checks all boxes, you have no right to reject him. Especially when you have all these issues that you've disclosed. And rarely you will find someone who would accept you with what you have. So say bismillah and move on with this proposal."
