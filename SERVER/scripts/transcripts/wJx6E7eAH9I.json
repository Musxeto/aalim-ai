  "title": "Delay Asr according to Hanafi madhab & offer dhur mins b4 Asr. Is my dhur valid?",
  "transcript": "our first question is from um Aisha she says in the subcontinent ah sir Adan is given very late and due to this people pray the her till the event of a sir which according to the humble Cora timetable is not the valid time for the  is there the prayer valid first of all the timings of Lahore was given to us by gibreel peace be upon him when he came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam over the duration of two days and in the first day he led our prophet alayhi salaatu I am in prayer at a particular specific time and then on the second day he led him on a different time and he told him that each prayers time is between the two times of these two days so each and every Muslim must it's an obligation upon each and every individual to know when the time begins and when the time ends and as Muslims we do not rely on watches we do not rely on clocks or calendars or people it is so easy that if a layman would come out of his home and follow the Sun and its position he would know the timings of salat but it is also convenient for a person to call the Adhan whom we call them Elvan whom we depend on his van to know the timings of summit and this happens in the Muslim world all over likewise when it comes to the months of the year ask any person on earth without having a calendar which day of the month we're in and which month this is he cannot know a similar person of similar Muslim if he were to be in his shoes and were asked which month this is if he doesn't know the month that was before and he doesn't know that times he could simply look at the position of the moon and estimate whether we are in the beginning in the middle or at the end furthermore he can tell you once the new month begins so he is capable of counting the months according to following when it begins and when it ends but those who follow the Gregorian calendar can never know whether it's February or December it's impossible for them to know whether we are in the beginning middle or the end of the months so Islam is a religion of simplicity and hence if I want to know the timings of the prayers through going to the hadith I can easily find out and this is the vast majority of Muslims and schools of thought agree upon that Fechter begins when the horizontal dawn appears so the whole horizon is black pitch black all of a sudden we see this white line coming that's horizontal and this is the break of dawn we can pray Fajr and we must refrain from eating and drinking if we fast thing this time of failure ends once the tip of the Sun appears that's it you cannot pray fetcher anymore because the time is over and if you delayed it deliberately it's gone then we come to overtime overtime if you put something and it's erect on the ground the Sun rises from here and the shade of this object is decreasing as the Sun rises the shade decreases until it's on top of it and there is no shade this is the time that prayer is prohibited voluntary prayer it becomes prohibited in these five minutes once the Sun goes a little bit to the west and there is a small shade to the east this is called as OA which inaugurates the time of the horn now the time of law has started as the Sun heads to the west and the shade is becoming longer and longer once the shade reaches the same length of this erected object the time of the  ends and the time of a sir begins when when the time the shade is equivalent to the erected object and this is the vast majority of scholars and schools of thought only the Hanafi school of thought say that if the length is twice as long not as long but twice as long of directed object then this is the time of a sir which means that there is about 40 minutes gap between the time of a sir of the majority of schools of thought which follow the authentic hadith of the Prophet Alistair of Salaam and the time of the Hanafi school and hence those who pray according to the Hanafi school and they delay the door after the shade of an erected object is equal to it there the is invalid and this is according to the hadith of the Prophet Elisha lazarum know if they are laymen if they are ignorant if there are people who do not know anything except what their scholars tell them then the sin falls on their scholars because they're ignorant but nowadays in the era of internet and satellite channels Islamic satellite channels that are coming to every home you have no excuse because you are told the hadith and you can check the authenticity of the hadith and you can ask the schools of thought other than the Hanafi schools of thought and they will tell you that this is wrong what they're doing so what are you waiting for mother even Asia we all know that Maghrib begins when the Sun totally disappears and it remains the timing until the time of Asia and the time of mother the end of mother and the beginning of Asia are very close how do we know by the disappearance of the redness in the direction of the West so after the Sun had set their remains in the horizon in the Twilight there remains redness due to the setting of the Sun and this remains for about 4550 minutes maybe an hour and then it disappears once it disappears you cannot pray mother mother the time is over and it's now time for Asia and this is why it is very dangerous when people rely on humble timetable now omekata timetable for fetcher though her answer and maghrib is pretty accurate only when it comes to Isha it is totally wrong you cannot and you must not follow Oman Korra's raesha timing why because they fix it at 1 hour and a half for 11 months of the year and on Ramadan which is the 12th month they make it 2 hours difference between sunset and Asia and this is totally wrong if you go inside the Arabia and if you're traveling like let's say from Medina back to Jeddah as you reach the outskirts of Jeddah if it's time for Margaret if it's time for Asia you can notice that as you're headed west the redness had disappeared about an hour and five minutes give or take five minutes so it's not 1 hour and 30 minutes after sunset which means that women who delay their mother depending on the fact that Risha are then is an hour and a half after sunset they have missed their mother prayer so I hope this answers your question"
