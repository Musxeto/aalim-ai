  "transcript": "consider subscribing brother farooq from qatar so i wanted to know the ruling on watching videos that may have some beneficial aspects in them but also contain uh major shake so after searching for an answer i found a clip of yours to a question which is that is watching a tv show that contains shake an act of shake so you answered that this is not sick unless you believe in it but this is a mutation but for another answer which was uh if a presenter on youtube is wearing a visa so is it uh is the content like okay to watch and and then you like i said this is permissible so like i can't tell the difference between the answers because of mine no level of understanding so can you please explain the difference between these two answers okay first of all i don't remember what i said yesterday let alone in previous videos so don't quote me on that second of all i'm not infallible i may say things and i was wrong and you cannot take what i say as something divine something that is quran or sunnah no we are human beings we make mistakes third of all what i say in an answer may fit only that answer but it differs with another questionnaire so they should not confuse the two don't relate questions to your issue when you don't have as you've said the proper knowledge to analyze and figure out whether this fits you or not ask a specific question for yourself and move along don't compare other answers to yours because it may differ due to a slight difference in the question like in the case of the famous story of ambassador be pleased with him and with his father when a man came to him said is there any repentance for a for a person who kills another he said no and he left ten minutes later another man comes and says is there any repentance for a man who kills another and he says yes who prevents him from repenting to allah azza so his students were shocked he said identical questions different answers he said the first one came with sparks coming out of his eyes i knew that he was intending to kill so he's asking whether there is room for repentance so that he would attempt and go ahead with killing someone else so i said no to prevent him from killing the other one came with remorse and tears filling his eyes and i knew that he has already committed the crime of murder and i did not want to block him from getting back to the straight path and seeking allah's forgiveness so i told him to answer so it's the same question different answers fourthly when a person wears a tawitha which is an amulet this is an act of shirk on his own i'm not committing shirk if he's a hindu if he's a super sufis if he's a grave worshiper this is on his own so is looking at him committing shirk no this is totally different than when i watch a clip of video where people say words of kufur or shirk or commit a black magic or predict the future which are acts of kufur in front of me and i am watching so these are two different issues basically speaking kuffar and shirk are things related to conviction so if you watch these things without any conviction it's a major sin but it it does not take you out of the fold of islam and allah azza who knows best you"
