  "transcript": "so those who are negligent of allah's mercy this is their season and this is their time every king has a specific time where he opens his doors and he answers people's requests and allah has the highest example subhanahu azzawajal if you ponder upon the hadith of the prophet al-islam you will be terrified the prophet sallallahu assalam once climbed up and he said i mean i mean i mean with every step so the companion said what are you saying i mean to o prophet of allah so the prophet said islam jibril came to me and he made three duas one of them whoever attains ramadan like us and is not forgiven yet admitted to hell fire may allah further him in it so the prophet said it made by jibril peace be upon him and the prophet said i mean do you have a shred of doubt that allah would not respond to it no allah would respond allah would answer it so the prophet is telling us that whoever attains ramadan like us yet fails to be forgiven hence admitted to hell fire due to his sins he doesn't deserve any mercy may allah further him more in hell fire this is an incentive these ten nights are your only chance of survival these are your only route of escaping hellfire if you lose this chance you'll never make it unfortunately if you miss it as you've missed it in the previous ramadans all these years you will never be successful in your whole life so it is a season in the west when apple announces that they're selling their iphone 14 and it will be tomorrow or three days from now you find people queuing under the rain under the sun under the snow for three nights for four nights just to get the first chance to buy that product allah has prepared a product for you in paradise where you will be there for eternity not for a ten thousand years or ten million years for eternity and you're refusing to queue you're refusing only to pray taraweeh prayer and night prayer imagine the grace of allah he tells you he who prays with the imam that is night prayer until the prayer is over he prays with her he will be accredited as if he prayed the whole night so if you pray isha with the imam then he prays taraweeh which is usually six to eight raka's then he postpones it until 1 30 or 2 o'clock in the morning and they pray another seven drakas if you manage to do that with the imam allah would accredit you as if you prayed from isha till fajr and this would mean that you've prayed the whole night prayer of laila talked and this means that you're a winner little time we are not capable at all of being like the self staying in the masjid for 10 hours worshiping allah praying reading the quran no no we are too lazy we are we are bombs unfortunately but allah has given us this minimal work maximum an hour and a half of prayer maximum in some masjids it's only half an hour or 40 minutes total of tarawih hunter yet allah with his grace favors you with praying the whole night yet you failed to do that why well i know people who take the whole month of ramadan their annual vacation just to fast and pray and make zikr and they are ready to work the whole 11 months of the year without any break because they believe because they feel the reward from allah the almighty so this is your chance my friend as a sinner coming from a similar sinner this is my chance and yours and this is my advice to you and allah azza you"
