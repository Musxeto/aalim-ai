  "title": "Can I lie and say I need to go to the bathroom in order to pray on time? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a Brahmin says if one is in a class is it permissible to lie and say he wants to go to the toilet in order to pray or is this lying and not permissible first of all lying at the Rihan is totally prohibited in Islam so whatever you do you try to dodge the issue the question you try to give ambiguous answers that can accept two meanings so that you do not lie but you do not lie straightforward no now in your case and this unfortunately happens a lot to people who are at work or to people who go to school in non-muslim countries and they find harassment and they find trouble praying on time because their boss the teachers the management would not allow them to do so first of all you have to abide by your religion you have to be proud with your religion and you have to be firm in practicing your religion why is it that sometimes we find Muslims weak and ashamed in a sense of their beliefs so people may not pray the may not Reyes or may not pray Maghrib and they combine all of this at the end of the day with Asia why they're ashamed of praying in an airport or in a mall or in a park and people looking at them subhanAllah there's no reason to be ashamed of your beliefs unless you're not convinced of it and this is problematic so you have to demand your rights this is part of your belief and religion now for students and workers sometimes workers or employees write to me and say that we cannot pray I don't understand how you can say that you cannot pray when you have 8 to 10 hours that you work and you need to go to the toilet you must have a coffee break a lot of them smoke and take time off for smoking you can't have the same 5 minutes to pray this is unbelievable not realistic so there is no problem a dry man for you to ask permission to go to the toilet and you can go to the toilet wash your hands and pray but to say that I want to go to the toilet and you don't go just simply to pray this is a lie saying that I'd like to go to the toilet and you do go to the toilet wash your hands or take a napkin or whatever and come out and pray in five minutes and come back is totally permissible and there's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah so Jian you"
