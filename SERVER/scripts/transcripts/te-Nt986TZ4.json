  "transcript": "Rahma from the UK. Rahma? Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, so every time that I read the Qur'an, especially Surah Al-Baqarah or when the Azan is called, I feel something in the left side of my body. Would it be possible that it's black magic? Most likely it is your subconscious playing games on you. See, we tend to blame our failures over black magic, evil eye, envy, and jinn possession. And this is one of our flaws and shortcomings. So anytime we fail in doing something, in communicating, the spouses are unable to live a happy marriage, the children we are unable to bring them to be practicing Muslims, they have mistakes and problems and this and that, we blame these things. And so many people watch videos and clips of people who are possessed, black magic, signs of this and that, and they store it in their subconscious until the right moment comes, the subconscious makes that surface. And this is what most likely is happening to you. I wouldn't say that you don't have black magic, but I would say most likely it is nothing. This tingling feeling is totally nothing. Alhamdulillah, if you pray normally, your adhkar is normal, your behavior is normal, everything is normal. It's just this tingling sensation or feeling. This is shaitan wanting you to stop reading Surat Al-Baqarah because it is burning him like hell."
