  "title": "If I avoid sharing Islamic posts that may seem extreme to islamophobes or seculars, is it hypocrisy?",
  "transcript": "Maisha from Bangladesh so um I get u a lot of wias while using social media such as I share Islamic posts which might be beneficial for people again I refrain from many posts which might seem as an extremism for people because of the you know secular or islamophobic mindset and again sometimes I might set privacy on other post which might not be Haram but at the same time not beneficial it's just random memes or any random posts so my question is um is it hypocrisy or kufur if I filter like this while you know choosing contents uh according to the audience on the contrary this is not hypocrisy this is what wisdom in Daw is all about if you know that a particular post would cause resentment and maybe confusion in the hearts of ignorant imbeciles or someone who has prenotions of or against Islam and this is only logical to prevent them from seeing anything that would increase that but if you know that people are susceptible and accepting to whatever you post which drives them closer to Allah and you do that that's a win win so no there is no hypocrisy in that see at the end of the day we Muslims judge things by the conclusion if I say this what is the conclusion sometimes I may talk to a woman and tell her when she's complaining about her husband why are you staying with him why don't you divorce him you don't have children you don't have this because she is the one who's causing the trouble in the marriage and I give her what is known as a shock therapy depending on her situation about her emotional state about her intellectual state so I give her something that would wake her up and tell her your husband could marry someone younger than you more much more beautiful much more religious who would make him happy then she wakes up and finds out that whoops what am I doing no no no no I'm I'm keeping my husband I'm going to be a good woman so you judge things by the conclusion if someone is already interested in leaving her husband and you encourage her and she gets a divorce that's not the right thing to do but when someone is reluctant and you do this in order to get her back on track and you know what you're doing inshallah this is uh wise of you"
