  "transcript": "Ezra says is virtual reality game online allowed it's where one plays and builds houses and buys his own character with different looks like hair color clothes etc if I make my own male character with blue skin and hair and exotic features does this come under imitation or of the creation of allah azza wajal since it's not drawn by hand and it's just a digital digital avatar is it fine as long not huming human looking the answer is no this is imitating the creation of Allah Azza WA JAL when you make such an avatar whether it has blue or green skin it is a creature that you are creating so yes I don't see any of Allah's creation looking like this avatar likewise a person drawing Mickey Mouse says I don't see any imitation of a Las creation but this is originally a mouse this is a cat this is spongebob that speaks it has a face that it has a character and goes around and people these are imitating the creation of allah azza wajal not specifically a creation of allah but they're giving life to something and this is not permissible in the sense that you are creating something that looks like a human being or similar to a human being and this is totally prohibited not necessarily that you draw this by hand and this is why we said so many times that such filters that people use with their photograph with the photographs and snapchat or whatever and and they make themselves pigs or animals or the likes by adding some features to their pictures or changing the features of their pictures this is considered to be imitating the creation of Allah and altering the creation of Allah likewise Photoshop when you use Photoshop on a picture on a person when you make his hair black or you remove the pimples traces or the aging process and you make that person younger this is imitating the creation of Allah and you cursed for that so Muslims should stay away from that"
